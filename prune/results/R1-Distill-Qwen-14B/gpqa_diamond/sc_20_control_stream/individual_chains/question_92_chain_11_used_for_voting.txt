Okay, so I have to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But the problem gives me bond energies, so maybe I should approach this using bond energies instead of standard enthalpies of formation of elements.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the question gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form isolated atoms. For carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol. So maybe this is for carbon atoms in their standard state, like graphite or something.

The molecule in question is an alkene, I think. Let me count the bonds. Each double bond is a C=C, and there are several single C-C bonds and C-H bonds. So to find the enthalpy of formation, I might need to calculate the total bond energy of the molecule and then relate it to the enthalpies of the elements.

Wait, the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think it's the other way around. Because when forming a molecule from elements, bonds are formed, so the energy is released. So maybe the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I think the bond energy approach is used to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction. For the formation of a compound, you can think of it as starting from the elements and forming the compound. So the enthalpy of formation would be the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the energy released when forming the bonds in the product. Wait, no—wait, it's the energy released when bonds are formed minus the energy absorbed when bonds are broken.

Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy changes when the bonds of the reactants (elements) are broken and the bonds of the product are formed. So the formula is: 

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reaction is elements forming the compound. So for the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements (like O2, H2, N2, etc.), and the product is the compound. So the enthalpy change is the bond energies of the reactants minus the bond energies of the product. But wait, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds that need to be broken to get the atoms, and the bond energies of the product are the bonds formed in the product. So the enthalpy of formation would be (sum of reactant bond energies) minus (sum of product bond energies). Because you're putting in energy to break the reactant bonds (endothermic) and getting energy out when forming product bonds (exothermic). So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of breaking bonds (reactants) minus sum of forming bonds (products).

Wait, but wait, I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, I've heard that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_f = [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) for reactants] - [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) for products]

But I'm not sure. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose I have a reaction like O2 → 2O. The bond energy of O2 is 498 kJ/mol. So breaking the bond requires energy, so the enthalpy would be positive. So if I form O2 from O atoms, it's exothermic.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the enthalpy of formation of a specific molecule from its elements. So the elements are carbon and hydrogen, since the molecule is made of C and H.

So, the formation reaction would be something like:

a C (graphite) + b H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 

Wait, but it's a bit complicated to figure out the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe the approach is to calculate the total bond energy in the molecule, considering each bond, and then relate that to the sum of bond energies from the elements.

Alternatively, maybe the question is actually asking about the enthalpy of atomization, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon (like from graphite to C atoms) and distribute the atoms. So for carbon, which is in a solid state, the bond energy is 1000 kJ/mol. But I'm not sure if that's the same as bond dissociation energy for C-C bonds.

Wait, no, the bond energy given is for C-C, which is 200 kJ/mol. So maybe the enthalpy of atomization is for breaking all the bonds in the elemental form. For example, in graphite, each C atom is bonded to three others. So to completely atomize, each C atom would require breaking three C-C bonds. But perhaps that's more detailed than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the total bond energy of the molecule, sum all the bonds, and then subtract the bond energies of the elements (as they were in their standard states, like C in graphite and H2) to get the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but how do I proceed? Maybe I should first figure out how many of each type of bond are present in the molecule.

So the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me try to count the bonds. Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. Let's see the structure:

It's a bit complex. Let me draw it mentally. The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, it's a chain with two double bonds. Let me break it down.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-.

So that's a (CH3)2C group connected by a double bond to CH-.

So the (CH3)2C has two CH3 groups attached to the central C, which is double-bonded to CH.

So in this part, the (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C (let's call it C1) is double bonded to C2 (in CH).
- C1 has two CH3 groups, so each CH3 has three C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups contribute 2 * 3 = 6 C-H bonds.
- The double bond is 1 C=C bond.

Then the CH- part: C2 is connected to a CH2 group. So the CH- (C2) is connected to CH2 (C3), which is connected to C4 (CH2), C5 (CH(CH3)), C6 (CH2), C7 (CH), which is double bonded to C8 (C in CH=C(CH3)2).

Wait, perhaps I should count each bond.

Let me try to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

Each carbon in a chain contributes bonds. Let's go step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

So the molecule has:

- How many C-H bonds?
- How many C-C bonds?
- How many C=C bonds?

Let me go through each part.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C-H bonds:

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds. There are two CH3 groups on C1 (the first C in the (CH3)2C= part), so 2 *3=6.

The CH in the (CH3)2C=CH- part has one C-H (since it's CH-).

Then, the next group is CH2- (C3), which has 2 C-H.

Then CH(CH3) (C5) has two C-H (since CH(CH3) has one C-H and the CH3 has three, but wait: CH(CH3) has a C connected to H and CH3 and another C. So the C in CH(CH3) has three bonds: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-... So wait, the CH(CH3) group is a C connected to another C (from CH2), a H, and a CH3. So that C has one C-H bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H.

The CH groups (like CH-) contribute 1 C-H.

CH2 groups contribute 2 C-H each.

So, let me list each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two CH3 groups: 2 * 3 =6 C-H.
   - CH group: 1 C-H.
   So total here: 6 +1 =7.

2. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:
   - First CH2: 2 C-H.
   - CH(CH3): 1 C-H (since it's CH-).
   - Next CH2: 2 C-H.
   - CH=C(CH3)2: The CH here has 1 C-H.
   So this part is 2 + 1 +2 +1 =6.

Wait, but the part after the first CH2 is CH(CH3), which is then attached to CH2, then to CH, which is attached to the double bond.

Wait, maybe the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the structure has two double bonds: between C1 and C2 (the first C=C), and between C7 and C8 (the last C=C).

So, breaking down each segment:

The first part: (CH3)2C=CH-.

- C1: two CH3 groups (6 C-H bonds), double bond to C2.
- C2: attached to CH- (1 C-H) and connected to C3.

Second part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

- C3: CH2 (2 C-H) connected to C4.
- C4: CH(CH3) has one C-H and a CH3 group (3 C-H, but wait, no—the CH3 is a group on C4, so C4 has one C-H and the CH3 contributes 3, but the C-H is part of C4's bonds. So that's 1 C-H for C4.
- C5: CH2 (2 C-H) connected to C6.
- C6: CH connected to C7, so 1 C-H.
- C7: connected to C6 and double bonded to C8 (so C=C bond).
- C8: has two CH3 groups (so 2*3=6 C-H bonds) and a C=C bond.

Now, let's count all the C-H bonds.

From each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - 6 (from two CH3) + 1 (from CH) =7.

2. CH2- (C3): 2.
3. CH(CH3) (C4): 1.
4. CH2 (C5): 2.
5. CH (C6):1.
6. C=C (between C7 and C8): no C-H here, but C8 has two CH3 groups, contributing 6 C-H.

So adding all C-H bonds:

7 (from part 1) + 2 (C3) +1 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +6 (C8) = 7+2=9; 9+1=10; 10+2=12; 12+1=13; 13+6=19.

So 19 C-H bonds.

Now, C-C bonds. Let's count the single C-C bonds.

Looking at the structure:

Each single bond between carbons counts as a C-C bond.

The molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the single bonds are:

Between C1 and C2: no, it's a double bond.

Wait, let's think in terms of the chain:

C1 (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the single bonds are:

C1 to C2: no (double bond)
C2 to C3: single
C3 to C4: single
C4 to C5: single
C5 to C6: single
C6 to C7: single
C7 to C8: double.

Wait, but the chain might have more single bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, C1 is connected via a double bond to C2.

C2 is connected to C3 via a single bond.

C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond.

C4 is connected to C5 via a single bond.

C5 is connected to C6 via a single bond.

C6 is connected to C7 via a single bond.

C7 is connected via a double bond to C8.

So, the number of C-C single bonds: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7. That's 5 C-C single bonds.

Additionally, the molecule has two double bonds: C1-C2 and C7-C8.

So total C-C bonds: 5 single bonds + 2 double bonds.

But wait, each double bond is one bond but contributes two C-C bonds? No, in bond counting, each double bond is a single bond with two bonds, but for counting purposes, perhaps each double bond is just one bond. Or wait, when considering the total number of C-C bonds, a double bond counts as one bond (since it's one bond but with two shared pairs). Hmm, but in terms of bond energy, a C=C bond has higher energy than a C-C bond, so each is considered a separate type.

Wait, in bond energy calculations, each bond is considered as a separate entity. So each C-C single bond is 200 kJ/mol, each C=C is 300 kJ/mol.

So in our molecule, we have:

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-C single bonds: Let me recount.

Looking at the structure again, the molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain is:

C1 (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain has:

- Between C1 and C2: double bond (1 double bond)
- C2-C3: single (1)
- C3-C4: single (2)
- C4-C5: single (3)
- C5-C6: single (4)
- C6-C7: single (5)
- C7-C8: double (2).

So that's 5 single C-C bonds and 2 double C=C bonds.

Wait, no. Wait, the chain from C2 to C7 is C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7. So that's five single bonds. Plus the two double bonds. So total C-C bonds: 5 (single) + 2 (double) → but wait, no, because each C=C is a separate bond type. So total C-C bonds are 5 (each single) plus 2 (each C=C, but each counts as a single bond, but with higher energy).

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify:

Each C-C single bond contributes 1 bond of 200 kJ/mol.

Each C=C bond contributes 1 bond of 300 kJ/mol.

So the total C-C bonds in the molecule are 5 single + 2 double → 5 + 2 =7 C-C bonds.

Each C-C bond contributes either 200 or 300 kJ/mol based on whether it's single or double.

So, in terms of bond energies, the C-C contributions are:

5 * 200 + 2 * 300 = 1000 + 600 = 1600 kJ/mol.

Now, the C-H bonds: 19 in total, each with bond energy 400 kJ/mol.

So 19 * 400 = 7600 kJ/mol.

So the total bond energy of the molecule is C-C + C-H + C=C.

Wait, no. Wait, the C-C bonds include the single and double bonds. Because each double bond is a C=C, which is a different bond type. So the total bond energy is:

Single C-C bonds: 5 * 200 = 1000.

Double C=C bonds: 2 * 300 = 600.

C-H bonds: 19 *400=7600.

So total bond energy in the molecule is 1000 +600 +7600 = 9200 kJ/mol.

But wait, how does this relate to the enthalpy of formation?

The enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (the elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product.

Wait, the reaction is:

Elements (C and H2) → molecule.

So the reaction would be: a C (graphite) + b H2 → molecule.

So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds in C (graphite) and H2.

The bond energies of the product are the bonds in the molecule.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of product].

Wait, but wait, the bond energies of the product are the bonds that are formed, so the energy is released when these bonds form. So the bonding in the product releases energy, which is subtracted.

But wait, when you form a molecule from its elements, you have to break the bonds in the elements (endothermic) and then form the bonds in the product (exothermic). So the enthalpy change is [energy required to break bonds in reactants] minus [energy released when forming bonds in product].

So, the formula is:

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of product).

But wait, the bond energies of the reactants are from their standard states. For carbon, the bond energy is the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, but what about H2? The bond energy is given as 100 kJ/mol (H-H bond).

So, the reactants are C (graphite) and H2.

So, for the formation reaction:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → 1 mol of molecule.

The bond energies for the reactants are: (n * 1000) + (m * 100) kJ/mol.

The bond energies for the product are the sum of all the bonds in the molecule, which is 9200 kJ/mol as calculated earlier.

So, ΔH_f = (n * 1000 + m *100) - 9200.

But I need to find n and m, the number of moles of C and H2 used to form the molecule.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's count the number of C and H atoms in the molecule.

Each CH3 group has 1 C and 3 H. Let's count:

Looking at each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has two CH3 → 2 C and 6 H.

The central C (C1) is connected to the two CH3 groups and the double bond to C2.

C2 is connected to CH-.

Then, the chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 has 2 H, and each CH has 1 H, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each type of atom.

Let me count the number of C atoms.

Each (CH3)2C group contributes 3 C (the central C and two CH3 Cs).

Then, the CH- contributes 1 C.

CH2-: 1 C.

CH(CH3): another C.

CH2: another.

CH: another.

C(CH3)2: 1 C with two CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each carbon in the structure. Let me list each C:

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's number each C:

C1: (CH3)2C connected to C2 via double bond.

C2: CH- connected to C3.

C3: CH2 connected to C4.

C4: CH(CH3) connected to C5.

C5: CH2 connected to C6.

C6: CH connected to C7.

C7: C connected to C6 and double bonded to C8.

C8: C connected to two CH3 groups.

So, total C atoms: 8.

Wait, let's recount:

C1: 1.

C2: 1.

C3:1.

C4:1.

C5:1.

C6:1.

C7:1.

C8:1.

Total: 8 C atoms.

Number of H atoms: let's count each H.

Each CH3 group has 3 H. How many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the molecule:

- C1 has two CH3 groups → 2 *3 =6 H.
- C8 has two CH3 groups →2 *3=6 H.
- C2 is CH- →1 H.
- C3 is CH2 →2 H.
- C4 is CH(CH3) →1 H (since it's CH-).
- C6 is CH →1 H.
- C7 is connected via double bond, but no H on it (as it's CH=C(CH3)2: the C=C is between C7 and C8, so C7 has one H? Wait, no.

Wait, let's re-examine:

After C6: it's CH.

So, the structure is:

...CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH is attached to C7, which is double bonded to C8.

So, C7 is connected to C6 (CH), and via double bond to C8.

So, C7 has no H attached because it's CH2-CH=C(...). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the structure is CH2-CH=C(...). So, the CH is C6, which is connected to C7 (which is part of the C=C). Let me re-express the end part:

CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, C6 is CH (connected to C5 and C7).

C7 is C connected to C6 and double bonded to C8, and has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, no: the formula is CH=C(CH3)2. So C7 is the C in the middle of CH=C(CH3)2. So C7 has one H and two CH3 groups, and a double bond to C8.

So, C7 has one H.

So, let's recount H:

C1: 6 H (2 CH3).

C2: 1 H.

C3: 2 H.

C4: 1 H.

C5: 2 H.

C6: 1 H.

C7: 1 H.

C8: 6 H (2 CH3).

So:

6 (C1) +1 (C2) +2 (C3) +1 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +1 (C7) +6 (C8) = 6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20 H atoms.

Wait, that gives 20 H atoms. So the molecule has 8 C and 20 H atoms.

So the molecular formula would be C8H20.

Wait, but let me check: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 CH3 → 2 C and 6 H.

The central C (C1) is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond.

Then, the rest: each CH2 contributes 2 H, each CH contributes 1 H.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to count each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2C=CH- → each CH3 has 3 H → 2*3=6, plus the CH has 1 → 7 H in this part.

Then, the next part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, C(CH3)2 has 6 H (since two CH3 groups, each 3 H → 2*3=6, but each CH3 is attached to C8, so 2 CH3 → 6 H).

So the second part's H: 2 +1 +2 +1 +6 =12.

So total H: 7 (first part) +12 (second part) =19? Wait, no, because the second part is after the CH2-, so perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, perhaps I should just trust the earlier count of 20 H. So the formula is C8H20.

Therefore, to form the molecule from its elements, the reaction is:

8 C (graphite) + 10 H2 → C8H20.

Because 20 H atoms come from 10 H2 molecules.

So, the number of moles of C and H2 in the reactants are 8 and 10, respectively.

Now, the bond energies for the reactants:

Each C in graphite has a bond energy of 1000 kJ/mol → so 8 mol C would contribute 8 * 1000 = 8000 kJ.

Each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol → 10 mol H2 would contribute 10 *100=1000 kJ.

So total bond energy of reactants: 8000 +1000 =9000 kJ/mol.

The bond energy of the product (the molecule) is 9200 kJ/mol as calculated earlier.

So, ΔH_f = (9000) - (9200) = -200 kJ/mol.

Wait, but this gives a negative value. But looking at the options, none of them are -200. Hmm, the options given are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

Wait, none of these match -200. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the product's bond energy.

Wait, let's re-calculate the product's bond energy.

We said the product has:

5 C-C (single) bonds: 5 *200 =1000.

2 C=C bonds: 2 *300 =600.

19 C-H bonds:19 *400=7600.

So total is 1000 +600=1600 +7600=9200 kJ/mol. That seems correct.

Reactants: 8 C → 8 *1000 =8000.

10 H2 →10 *100=1000.

Total reactant bond energy:9000.

Product bond energy:9200.

So ΔH_f=9000 -9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So the last part is CH=C(CH3)2.

Which implies that the last CH is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So perhaps I made an error in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

The structure is:

C1 (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the chain is C1=C2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH=C8(CH3)2.

So counting the C-C bonds:

C1=C2 (no C-C bond here, it's a double bond).

C2-C3 (CH2): single → 1.

C3-C4 (CH(CH3)): single →2.

C4-C5 (CH2): single →3.

C5-C6 (CH): single →4.

C6-C7 (C in CH=C...): single →5.

C7=C8: double → counts as another bond, but it's a C=C.

Wait, so the C-C single bonds are 5.

The C=C bonds are 2.

So total C-C bonds:5 single, 2 double.

So 5*200 + 2*300 =1000 +600=1600 kJ/mol.

C-H bonds:19 → 19*400=7600.

Total: 1600+7600=9200.

Hmm, same as before. So the product's bond energy is 9200.

Reactant bond energy:8*1000 (C) +10*100 (H2)=8000+1000=9000.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molecule's structure.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of H atoms. Let me recount the H.

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So summing:

6 +1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20. So 20 H.

So the formula is C8H20.

So the reaction is 8 C +10 H2 → C8H20.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the molecule isn't C8H20. Let's check again. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's break it into each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: that's (CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C (C1, two CH3 Cs) and 7 H (6 from CH3, 1 from CH).

Then, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 H (since it's CH-).

CH2: 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, C(CH3)2 has 6 H.

So the second part contributes 2+1+2+1+6 =12 H.

Total H:7+12=19? But earlier count was 20. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the last CH=C(CH3)2 contributes 1 H (CH) and 6 H from the two CH3 groups →7 H. Then, the CH2 before it contributes 2 H. And the CH(CH3) contributes 1.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the H in the second part:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and C(CH3)2 has 6 H.

So that's 2+1=3; +2=5; +1=6; +6=12.

So second part has 12 H.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH- →7 H.

So total H:7+12=19? But earlier count was 20. So now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me think again.

In the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

How many H on each C:

C1: (CH3)2 → 6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So 6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20.

Ah, I see. So that's 20 H.

Ah, because the CH=C(CH3)2 group is at the end, so C7 is the CH in CH=C(CH3)2, which has 1 H, and C8 has two CH3 groups (6 H).

So perhaps the earlier count was correct. So the formula is C8H20.

So the reaction is 8 C + 10 H2 → C8H20.

So bond energies:

Reactants: 8 *1000 (C) + 10 *100 (H2) = 8000 +1000=9000 kJ.

Product: 9200.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product's bond energy.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't C8H20. Let me recount the structure.

Wait, another way to write the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The formula can be written as C8H14? Because each (CH3)2C=CH contributes 4 C and 7 H (each CH3 is 3 H, two CH3 groups →6, plus CH →1, and the C=CH is part of a larger structure.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C and H again.

Wait, the formula is:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: Each has 3 C (the central C and two CH3 Cs) and 7 H (6 from CH3, 1 from CH).

But then, the rest of the structure: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

This part is:

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 C, 1 H.

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (CH and C(CH3)2), and 7 H (1 from CH, 6 from C(CH3)2).

Wait, no, the CH=C(CH3)2 is a group with two C's: the CH and the C in C(CH3)2. So that's two more C's beyond the initial (CH3)2C=CH group.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C:

(CH3)2C=CH: 3 C.

Then, the next chain:

CH2: 1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C.

So total C:3 +1 +1 +1 +2=8. Correct.

H:

(CH3)2C=CH:7 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 (from CH) + 6 (from C(CH3)2) =7 H.

So total H:7 +2 +1 +2 +7=19.

Hmm, but earlier count was 20. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the CH=C(CH3)2 group has two CH3 groups, contributing 6 H, but the CH has 1 H, so 7 H. Then, the preceding CH2 has 2 H → 2. The CH(CH3) has 1. The initial (CH3)2C=CH has 7.

So 7 (initial) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C(CH3)2) =7+2=9+1=10+2=12+7=19 H. So the formula is C8H19? But that's impossible since H must be even.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C8H14. Let me count again.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH is 4 C and 7 H.

Wait, no: (CH3)2C=CH is (CH3)2-C=CH2? No, in the given structure, it's (CH3)2C=CH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each group:

First group: (CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C, 7 H.

Then the next part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

That's:

CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C, 1 H.

CH2:1 C,2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C, 1+6=7 H.

So, C in this part:1+1+1+2=5.

H:2+1+2+7=12.

So overall:3+5=8 C, 7+12=19 H.

But 19 is odd, which is impossible for a hydrocarbon. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait, perhaps the last CH=C(CH3)2 is actually CH2=C(CH3)2?

Wait, no, the formula as given is CH=C(CH3)2, so it's CH connected to a C with two CH3 groups and double bonded.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me try again.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 H.

The molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH has 7 H.

Then, the rest: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C has two CH3 groups →6 H.

So, the second part:

CH2 (2) + CH(CH3) (1) + CH2 (2) + CH=C(CH3)2 (1+6=7) →2+1=3+2=5+7=12 H.

So total H:7+12=19. But 19 is odd. That can't be right. So perhaps the formula is C8H18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the H:

Looking at each carbon:

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So, 6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20. So 20 H.

So formula is C8H20.

But then, in the reaction, the H2 molecules needed are 10, since 20 H atoms come from 10 H2.

Wait, but 8 C and 10 H2 → C8H20.

So the bond energies:

Reactants:8 *1000 (C) +10 *100 (H2) = 9000 kJ.

Product bonds:9200 kJ.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energy calculation.

Alternative approach: maybe the question is about the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation. But the question says "enthalpy of formation".

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the elements minus the bond energies of the molecule, but maybe I have the signs reversed.

Wait, because when you form the molecule, you're releasing energy. So the formula is:

ΔH_f = sum of bonds broken (reactants) - sum of bonds formed (products).

So, (reactant bonds) - (product bonds) = 9000 -9200 = -200 kJ/mol.

Negative ΔHf suggests it's exothermic. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the formula, and it's (product bonds) - (reactant bonds).

So ΔHf = 9200 -9000 = 200 kJ/mol.

But this isn't an option either.

Looking at the options again:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → way too high.

B)67.4 kJ/mol → around 67.

C)11.44 kJ/g → about 11 kJ per gram.

D)1900 kJ/g → 1900 per gram.

Wait, but the calculation gives 200 kJ/mol, which is 200,000 kJ/g (if assuming molar mass is 1 g/mol, which it's not).

Wait, the molecular weight of C8H20 is (8*12)+(20*1) =96 +20=116 g/mol.

So 200 kJ/mol is 200 / 116 ≈ 1.724 kJ/g.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation in kJ/g, but the given options have C and D in kJ/g.

Wait, option C is 11.44 kJ/g. Which is about 11.44 *116=1325 kJ/mol.

But our calculation was 200 kJ/mol.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the question is considering the enthalpy of formation from elements in their standard states, but using bond energies, not the enthalpies of formation of the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_f = [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) of reactants] - [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) of products].

But in our case, that's 9000 -9200= -200.

But this doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the product's bond energy.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bond energies given are for breaking the bonds, so the product's bond energy is the sum of the bonds in the molecule. But when forming the molecule, the bonds are formed, which releases energy. So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bonds broken (reactants) minus the sum of bonds formed (products).

So, it's 9000 (reactant bonds) -9200 (product bonds) =-200 kJ/mol.

But this is negative, which is possible. However, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation. But the question says enthalpy of formation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, let me recount the bonds in the molecule.

C-C bonds:

Number of single C-C bonds:5.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

So 5 +2=7 C-C bonds.

Each C-C (single) is 200 kJ/mol →5*200=1000.

Each C=C is 300 →2*300=600.

So 1600.

C-H:19 *400=7600.

Total:1600+7600=9200.

Yes, correct.

Reactant bonds:8*1000 (C) +10*100 (H2)=9000.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of H atoms. Wait, perhaps there are 18 H atoms, making the formula C8H18.

If so, then:

Molecular formula C8H18.

So the reaction would be 8 C +9 H2 → C8H18.

Then, bond energies:

Reactants:8*1000 +9 *100=8000+900=8900.

Product bonds: same as before:9200.

ΔHf=8900-9200= -300.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C8H14.

Let me count again:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group →7 H.

Then, the rest: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 H (CH) +6 H (C(CH3)2) →7.

So total H:7+2=9 +1=10 +2=12 +7=19.

Wait, still 19. So perhaps the formula is C8H18, with 18 H.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → much higher than our calculation.

B)67.4 kJ/mol → around 67.

C)11.44 kJ/g → around 11 per gram.

D)1900 kJ/g → 1900 per gram.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the molecule, not the formation.

Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule to form isolated atoms. So, calculate the total bond energy of the molecule.

Which is 9200 kJ/mol. But the options don't have this.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 11200. Which is higher than 9200.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps in the molecule, each (CH3)2 group is present on both ends, contributing more C-H bonds.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the two ends are (CH3)2C=... and ...C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 contributes 6 C-H bonds. There are two such groups →12.

The CH groups contribute 1 each. There are two CH groups: the one at C2 and the one at C6 (in the middle of the chain).

Wait, perhaps I missed some CH groups.

Wait, perhaps:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has two CH3 groups and a CH.

CH2 groups: each has 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

So perhaps the count is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each type of C.

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So total H:6+1+2+1+2+1+1+6=20.

So 20 H, correct.

So, the reaction is 8 C +10 H2 → C8H20.

Bond energies:

Reactants:8*1000 +10*100=9000.

Product:9200.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the formation from elements, but from some other compounds. But the question says "enthalpy of formation of the compound", which is from elements in their standard states.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the enthalpy of formation in terms of the enthalpy of atomization, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the formula:

ΔH_f = [Σ (bond energies of product)] - [Σ (bond energies of reactants)].

But that would be 9200 -9000=200.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to take the opposite sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

ΔH_f = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of product)].

Which would give -200 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has 18 C-H bonds.

Wait, if I recount:

C1:6 → yes.

C2:1.

C3:2.

C4:1.

C5:2.

C6:1.

C7:1.

C8:6.

Total:6+1=7+2=9+1=10+2=12+1=13+1=14+6=20.

So, no, 20.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole.

But the question states bond energies in kJ/mol, so that's correct.

I'm stuck. The only option that makes sense is B)67.4, but I can't see how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is something else.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

In that case, perhaps there's an additional CH2 group, changing the structure.

But the given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the question is not about the formation of the molecule from elements, but from its constituent atoms, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol, as the energy required to form C atoms from carbon in its standard state.

So, for each C atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol to atomize.

So, the calculation would be:

Sum of bond energies of reactants (elements) minus sum of bond energies of product.

Which is:

(8 *1000) + (10 *100) - [5*200 +2*300 +19*400] = 9000 -9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ/g, not kJ/mol.

So, ΔHf is -200 kJ/mol.

Molar mass of C8H20 is (8×12)+(20×1)=96+20=116 g/mol.

So, per gram: -200 /116 ≈-1.724 kJ/g.

But it's negative, and the options have positive values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value, 1.724 kJ/g, which is about 1.7 kJ/g, but none of the options match.

Looking at the options, option C is 11.44 kJ/g. Which is much higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of H or C.

Let me think again: the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H.

The double bonds are between C1-C2 and C7-C8.

So, the molecule has 8 C atoms, 20 H atoms.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

8 C (graphite) +10 H2 (g) → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 (l) + ... ?

But the calculation remains the same.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the bond energy of H2 as 432 kJ/mol instead of 100, but the question states 100.

No, the question gives H-H as 100.

Wait, perhaps the bond energy of C-C is 1000/3 ≈333.33 kJ/mol, but no, the question gives 200.

Hmm.

Well, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer according to the calculation is -200 kJ/mol, but it's not an option. However, perhaps the intended approach was different.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation. The enthalpy of atomization would be the sum of all bond energies in the molecule, which is 9200 kJ/mol. But that's not an option either.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol.

Hmm, perhaps the approach was to calculate the number of moles of H2 used and apply a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = (number of C × 1000) + (number of H2 × 100) - [sum of product bonds].

Which is the same as before.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H2 molecules.

The molecular formula is C8H20 → H2 needed is 10.

So, 10 H2.

So, 8*1000 +10*100=9000.

Product bonds:9200.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200.

But no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not taking into account the double bonds correctly.

Alternative approach: perhaps each double bond contributes two C-C bonds.

But no, a double bond is a single bond with two pairs, but in bond energy terms, each C=C is treated as one bond with higher energy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done per gram, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 200 kJ/mol is about 1.724 kJ/g.

But the options have C as 11.44 kJ/g, which is about 1325 kJ/mol.

So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the product's bond energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, recounting:

C1:6.

C2:1.

C3:2.

C4:1.

C5:2.

C6:1.

C7:1.

C8:6.

Total:6+1=7+2=9+1=10+2=12+1=13+1=14+6=20.

So 20 C-H bonds.

Yes.

So, 20 *400=8000.

Wait, earlier I thought 19, but now it's 20.

Wait, no, wait: 20 C-H bonds would be 20 *400=8000.

But earlier I had 19 C-H bonds, which is 7600.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. So if there are 20 C-H bonds, then:

C-C:5*200 +2*300=1000+600=1600.

C-H:20*400=8000.

Total:1600+8000=9600.

Reactants:8*1000 +10*100=9000.

ΔHf=9000-9600= -600 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but this still doesn't match any option.

Wait, but 20 C-H bonds would mean the formula is C8H20.

But earlier counts give 20 H, so that's correct.

So, 20 C-H bonds.

So product bond energy:1600+8000=9600.

ΔHf=9000-9600= -600 kJ/mol.

Still not matching options.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is B)67.4, but I can't see how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the bond energies for H-H as 432 instead of 100, but the question states 100.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies for C-C as 333 instead of 200, but no.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

The structure:

(C1)(CH3)2-C(=C2)-CH2-C3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH4-CH(=C5)(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the single bonds.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the chain is:

C1=C2-CH2-C3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C8(CH3)2.

So the single C-C bonds are between C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7.

That's five single C-C bonds.

Plus two double C=C bonds (C1-C2 and C7-C8).

So 5 +2=7 C-C bonds.

So 5 *200=1000, 2*300=600 →1600.

C-H:20 *400=8000.

Total:9600.

ΔHf=9000-9600= -600.

Still not matching.

Well, I think I've spent too much time on this. Perhaps the intended answer is B)67.4, but I can't see how to get it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. But given the options, I'll have to choose the closest.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The approach involves determining the total bond energy of the molecule and comparing it to the bond energies of the reactants (elements in their standard states).

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The molecule is analyzed to have **8 carbon atoms (C)** and **20 hydrogen atoms (H)**, giving the formula **C₈H₂₀**.

2. **Bond energy of the product (molecule)**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 5 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1000 kJ/mol.  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.  
   - **C-H bonds**: 20 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 8000 kJ/mol.  
   Total bond energy of the molecule = **1000 + 600 + 8000 = 9600 kJ/mol**.

3. **Bond energy of the reactants**:  
   The reactants are carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).  
   - **C (graphite)**: 8 moles × 1000 kJ/mol = 8000 kJ/mol.  
   - **H₂**: 10 moles × 100 kJ/mol = 1000 kJ/mol.  
   Total bond energy of reactants = **8000 + 1000 = 9000 kJ/mol**.

4. **Calculate enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f)**:  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Bond energy of reactants} - \text{Bond energy of product}
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 9000 - 9600 = -600 \, \text{kJ/mol}.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But the problem gives me bond energies, so maybe I should approach this using bond energies instead of standard enthalpies of formation of elements.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the question gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form isolated atoms. For carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol. So maybe this is for carbon atoms in their standard state, like graphite or something.

The molecule in question is an alkene, I think. Let me count the bonds. Each double bond is a C=C, and there are several single C-C bonds and C-H bonds. So to find the enthalpy of formation, I might need to calculate the total bond energy of the molecule and then relate it to the enthalpies of the elements.

Wait, the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think it's the other way around. Because when forming a molecule from elements, bonds are formed, so the energy is released. So maybe the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I think the bond energy approach is used to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction. For the formation of a compound, you can think of it as starting from the elements and forming the compound. So the enthalpy of formation would be the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the energy released when forming the bonds in the product. Wait, no—wait, it's the energy released when bonds are formed minus the energy absorbed when bonds are broken.

Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy changes when the bonds of the reactants (elements) are broken and the bonds of the product are formed. So the formula is: 

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reaction is elements forming the compound. So for the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements (like O2, H2, N2, etc.), and the product is the compound. So the enthalpy change is the bond energies of the reactants minus the bond energies of the product. But wait, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds that need to be broken to get the atoms, and the bond energies of the product are the bonds formed in the product. So the enthalpy of formation would be (sum of reactant bond energies) minus (sum of product bond energies). Because you're putting in energy to break the reactant bonds (endothermic) and getting energy out when forming product bonds (exothermic). So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of breaking bonds (reactants) minus sum of forming bonds (products).

Wait, but wait, I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, I've heard that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_f = [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) for reactants] - [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) for products]

But I'm not sure. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose I have a reaction like O2 → 2O. The bond energy of O2 is 498 kJ/mol. So breaking the bond requires energy, so the enthalpy would be positive. So if I form O2 from O atoms, it's exothermic.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the enthalpy of formation of a specific molecule from its elements. So the elements are carbon and hydrogen, since the molecule is made of C and H.

So, the formation reaction would be something like:

a C (graphite) + b H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 

Wait, but it's a bit complicated to figure out the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe the approach is to calculate the total bond energy in the molecule, considering each bond, and then relate that to the sum of bond energies from the elements.

Alternatively, maybe the question is actually asking about the enthalpy of atomization, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon (like from graphite to C atoms) and distribute the atoms. So for carbon, which is in a solid state, the bond energy is 1000 kJ/mol. But I'm not sure if that's the same as bond dissociation energy for C-C bonds.

Wait, no, the bond energy given is for C-C, which is 200 kJ/mol. So maybe the enthalpy of atomization is for breaking all the bonds in the elemental form. For example, in graphite, each C atom is bonded to three others. So to completely atomize, each C atom would require breaking three C-C bonds. But perhaps that's more detailed than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the total bond energy of the molecule, sum all the bonds, and then subtract the bond energies of the elements (as they were in their standard states, like C in graphite and H2) to get the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but how do I proceed? Maybe I should first figure out how many of each type of bond are present in the molecule.

So the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me try to count the bonds. Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. Let's see the structure:

It's a bit complex. Let me draw it mentally. The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, it's a chain with two double bonds. Let me break it down.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-.

So that's a (CH3)2C group connected by a double bond to CH-.

So the (CH3)2C has two CH3 groups attached to the central C, which is double-bonded to CH.

So in this part, the (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C (let's call it C1) is double bonded to C2 (in CH).
- C1 has two CH3 groups, so each CH3 has three C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups contribute 2 * 3 = 6 C-H bonds.
- The double bond is 1 C=C bond.

Then the CH- part: C2 is connected to a CH2 group. So the CH- (C2) is connected to CH2 (C3), which is connected to C4 (CH2), C5 (CH(CH3)), C6 (CH2), C7 (CH), which is double bonded to C8 (C in CH=C(CH3)2).

Wait, perhaps I should count each bond.

Let me try to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

Each carbon in a chain contributes bonds. Let's go step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

So the molecule has:

- How many C-H bonds?
- How many C-C bonds?
- How many C=C bonds?

Let me go through each part.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C-H bonds:

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds. There are two CH3 groups on C1 (the first C in the (CH3)2C= part), so 2 *3=6.

The CH in the (CH3)2C=CH- part has one C-H (since it's CH-).

Then, the next group is CH2- (C3), which has 2 C-H.

Then CH(CH3) (C5) has two C-H (since CH(CH3) has one C-H and the CH3 has three, but wait: CH(CH3) has a C connected to H and CH3 and another C. So the C in CH(CH3) has three bonds: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-... So wait, the CH(CH3) group is a C connected to another C (from CH2), a H, and a CH3. So that C has one C-H bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H.

The CH groups (like CH-) contribute 1 C-H.

CH2 groups contribute 2 C-H each.

So, let me list each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two CH3 groups: 2 * 3 =6 C-H.
   - CH group: 1 C-H.
   So total here: 6 +1 =7.

2. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:
   - First CH2: 2 C-H.
   - CH(CH3): 1 C-H (since it's CH-).
   - Next CH2: 2 C-H.
   - CH=C(CH3)2: The CH here has 1 C-H.
   So this part is 2 + 1 +2 +1 =6.

Wait, but the part after the first CH2 is CH(CH3), which is then attached to CH2, then to CH, which is attached to the double bond.

Wait, maybe the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the structure has two double bonds: between C1 and C2 (the first C=C), and between C7 and C8 (the last C=C).

So, breaking down each segment:

The first part: (CH3)2C=CH-.

- C1: two CH3 groups (6 C-H bonds), double bond to C2.
- C2: attached to CH- (1 C-H) and connected to C3.

Second part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

- C3: CH2 (2 C-H) connected to C4.
- C4: CH(CH3) has one C-H and a CH3 group (3 C-H, but wait, no—the CH3 is a group on C4, so C4 has one C-H and the CH3 contributes 3, but the C-H is part of C4's bonds. So that's 1 C-H for C4.
- C5: CH2 (2 C-H) connected to C6.
- C6: CH connected to C7, so 1 C-H.
- C7: connected to C6 and double bonded to C8 (so C=C bond).
- C8: has two CH3 groups (so 2*3=6 C-H bonds) and a C=C bond.

Now, let's count all the C-H bonds.

From each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - 6 (from two CH3) + 1 (from CH) =7.

2. CH2- (C3): 2.
3. CH(CH3) (C4): 1.
4. CH2 (C5): 2.
5. CH (C6):1.
6. C=C (between C7 and C8): no C-H here, but C8 has two CH3 groups, contributing 6 C-H.

So adding all C-H bonds:

7 (from part 1) + 2 (C3) +1 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +6 (C8) = 7+2=9; 9+1=10; 10+2=12; 12+1=13; 13+6=19.

So 19 C-H bonds.

Now, C-C bonds. Let's count the single C-C bonds.

Looking at the structure:

Each single bond between carbons counts as a C-C bond.

The molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the single bonds are:

Between C1 and C2: no, it's a double bond.

Wait, let's think in terms of the chain:

C1 (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the single bonds are:

C1 to C2: no (double bond)
C2 to C3: single
C3 to C4: single
C4 to C5: single
C5 to C6: single
C6 to C7: single
C7 to C8: double.

Wait, but the chain might have more single bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, C1 is connected via a double bond to C2.

C2 is connected to C3 via a single bond.

C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond.

C4 is connected to C5 via a single bond.

C5 is connected to C6 via a single bond.

C6 is connected to C7 via a single bond.

C7 is connected via a double bond to C8.

So, the number of C-C single bonds: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7. That's 5 C-C single bonds.

Additionally, the molecule has two double bonds: C1-C2 and C7-C8.

So total C-C bonds: 5 single bonds + 2 double bonds.

But wait, each double bond is one bond but contributes two C-C bonds? No, in bond counting, each double bond is a single bond with two bonds, but for counting purposes, perhaps each double bond is just one bond. Or wait, when considering the total number of C-C bonds, a double bond counts as one bond (since it's one bond but with two shared pairs). Hmm, but in terms of bond energy, a C=C bond has higher energy than a C-C bond, so each is considered a separate type.

Wait, in bond energy calculations, each bond is considered as a separate entity. So each C-C single bond is 200 kJ/mol, each C=C is 300 kJ/mol.

So in our molecule, we have:

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-C single bonds: Let me recount.

Looking at the structure again, the molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain is:

C1 (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain has:

- Between C1 and C2: double bond (1 double bond)
- C2-C3: single (1)
- C3-C4: single (2)
- C4-C5: single (3)
- C5-C6: single (4)
- C6-C7: single (5)
- C7-C8: double (2).

So that's 5 single C-C bonds and 2 double C=C bonds.

Wait, no. Wait, the chain from C2 to C7 is C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7. So that's five single bonds. Plus the two double bonds. So total C-C bonds: 5 (single) + 2 (double) → but wait, no, because each C=C is a separate bond type. So total C-C bonds are 5 (each single) plus 2 (each C=C, but each counts as a single bond, but with higher energy).

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify:

Each C-C single bond contributes 1 bond of 200 kJ/mol.

Each C=C bond contributes 1 bond of 300 kJ/mol.

So the total C-C bonds in the molecule are 5 single + 2 double → 5 + 2 =7 C-C bonds.

Each C-C bond contributes either 200 or 300 kJ/mol based on whether it's single or double.

So, in terms of bond energies, the C-C contributions are:

5 * 200 + 2 * 300 = 1000 + 600 = 1600 kJ/mol.

Now, the C-H bonds: 19 in total, each with bond energy 400 kJ/mol.

So 19 * 400 = 7600 kJ/mol.

So the total bond energy of the molecule is C-C + C-H + C=C.

Wait, no. Wait, the C-C bonds include the single and double bonds. Because each double bond is a C=C, which is a different bond type. So the total bond energy is:

Single C-C bonds: 5 * 200 = 1000.

Double C=C bonds: 2 * 300 = 600.

C-H bonds: 19 *400=7600.

So total bond energy in the molecule is 1000 +600 +7600 = 9200 kJ/mol.

But wait, how does this relate to the enthalpy of formation?

The enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (the elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product.

Wait, the reaction is:

Elements (C and H2) → molecule.

So the reaction would be: a C (graphite) + b H2 → molecule.

So, the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds in C (graphite) and H2.

The bond energies of the product are the bonds in the molecule.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of product].

Wait, but wait, the bond energies of the product are the bonds that are formed, so the energy is released when these bonds form. So the bonding in the product releases energy, which is subtracted.

But wait, when you form a molecule from its elements, you have to break the bonds in the elements (endothermic) and then form the bonds in the product (exothermic). So the enthalpy change is [energy required to break bonds in reactants] minus [energy released when forming bonds in product].

So, the formula is:

ΔH_f = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of product).

But wait, the bond energies of the reactants are from their standard states. For carbon, the bond energy is the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, but what about H2? The bond energy is given as 100 kJ/mol (H-H bond).

So, the reactants are C (graphite) and H2.

So, for the formation reaction:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → 1 mol of molecule.

The bond energies for the reactants are: (n * 1000) + (m * 100) kJ/mol.

The bond energies for the product are the sum of all the bonds in the molecule, which is 9200 kJ/mol as calculated earlier.

So, ΔH_f = (n * 1000 + m *100) - 9200.

But I need to find n and m, the number of moles of C and H2 used to form the molecule.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's count the number of C and H atoms in the molecule.

Each CH3 group has 1 C and 3 H. Let's count:

Looking at each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has two CH3 → 2 C and 6 H.

The central C (C1) is connected to the two CH3 groups and the double bond to C2.

C2 is connected to CH-.

Then, the chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 has 2 H, and each CH has 1 H, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each type of atom.

Let me count the number of C atoms.

Each (CH3)2C group contributes 3 C (the central C and two CH3 Cs).

Then, the CH- contributes 1 C.

CH2-: 1 C.

CH(CH3): another C.

CH2: another.

CH: another.

C(CH3)2: 1 C with two CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each carbon in the structure. Let me list each C:

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's number each C:

C1: (CH3)2C connected to C2 via double bond.

C2: CH- connected to C3.

C3: CH2 connected to C4.

C4: CH(CH3) connected to C5.

C5: CH2 connected to C6.

C6: CH connected to C7.

C7: C connected to C6 and double bonded to C8.

C8: C connected to two CH3 groups.

So, total C atoms: 8.

Wait, let's recount:

C1: 1.

C2: 1.

C3:1.

C4:1.

C5:1.

C6:1.

C7:1.

C8:1.

Total: 8 C atoms.

Number of H atoms: let's count each H.

Each CH3 group has 3 H. How many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the molecule:

- C1 has two CH3 groups → 2 *3 =6 H.
- C8 has two CH3 groups →2 *3=6 H.
- C2 is CH- →1 H.
- C3 is CH2 →2 H.
- C4 is CH(CH3) →1 H (since it's CH-).
- C6 is CH →1 H.
- C7 is connected via double bond, but no H on it (as it's CH=C(CH3)2: the C=C is between C7 and C8, so C7 has one H? Wait, no.

Wait, let's re-examine:

After C6: it's CH.

So, the structure is:

...CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH is attached to C7, which is double bonded to C8.

So, C7 is connected to C6 (CH), and via double bond to C8.

So, C7 has no H attached because it's CH2-CH=C(...). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the structure is CH2-CH=C(...). So, the CH is C6, which is connected to C7 (which is part of the C=C). Let me re-express the end part:

CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, C6 is CH (connected to C5 and C7).

C7 is C connected to C6 and double bonded to C8, and has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, no: the formula is CH=C(CH3)2. So C7 is the C in the middle of CH=C(CH3)2. So C7 has one H and two CH3 groups, and a double bond to C8.

So, C7 has one H.

So, let's recount H:

C1: 6 H (2 CH3).

C2: 1 H.

C3: 2 H.

C4: 1 H.

C5: 2 H.

C6: 1 H.

C7: 1 H.

C8: 6 H (2 CH3).

So:

6 (C1) +1 (C2) +2 (C3) +1 (C4) +2 (C5) +1 (C6) +1 (C7) +6 (C8) = 6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20 H atoms.

Wait, that gives 20 H atoms. So the molecule has 8 C and 20 H atoms.

So the molecular formula would be C8H20.

Wait, but let me check: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 CH3 → 2 C and 6 H.

The central C (C1) is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond.

Then, the rest: each CH2 contributes 2 H, each CH contributes 1 H.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to count each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2C=CH- → each CH3 has 3 H → 2*3=6, plus the CH has 1 → 7 H in this part.

Then, the next part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, C(CH3)2 has 6 H (since two CH3 groups, each 3 H → 2*3=6, but each CH3 is attached to C8, so 2 CH3 → 6 H).

So the second part's H: 2 +1 +2 +1 +6 =12.

So total H: 7 (first part) +12 (second part) =19? Wait, no, because the second part is after the CH2-, so perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, perhaps I should just trust the earlier count of 20 H. So the formula is C8H20.

Therefore, to form the molecule from its elements, the reaction is:

8 C (graphite) + 10 H2 → C8H20.

Because 20 H atoms come from 10 H2 molecules.

So, the number of moles of C and H2 in the reactants are 8 and 10, respectively.

Now, the bond energies for the reactants:

Each C in graphite has a bond energy of 1000 kJ/mol → so 8 mol C would contribute 8 * 1000 = 8000 kJ.

Each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol → 10 mol H2 would contribute 10 *100=1000 kJ.

So total bond energy of reactants: 8000 +1000 =9000 kJ/mol.

The bond energy of the product (the molecule) is 9200 kJ/mol as calculated earlier.

So, ΔH_f = (9000) - (9200) = -200 kJ/mol.

Wait, but this gives a negative value. But looking at the options, none of them are -200. Hmm, the options given are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

Wait, none of these match -200. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the product's bond energy.

Wait, let's re-calculate the product's bond energy.

We said the product has:

5 C-C (single) bonds: 5 *200 =1000.

2 C=C bonds: 2 *300 =600.

19 C-H bonds:19 *400=7600.

So total is 1000 +600=1600 +7600=9200 kJ/mol. That seems correct.

Reactants: 8 C → 8 *1000 =8000.

10 H2 →10 *100=1000.

Total reactant bond energy:9000.

Product bond energy:9200.

So ΔH_f=9000 -9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So the last part is CH=C(CH3)2.

Which implies that the last CH is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So perhaps I made an error in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

The structure is:

C1 (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the chain is C1=C2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH=C8(CH3)2.

So counting the C-C bonds:

C1=C2 (no C-C bond here, it's a double bond).

C2-C3 (CH2): single → 1.

C3-C4 (CH(CH3)): single →2.

C4-C5 (CH2): single →3.

C5-C6 (CH): single →4.

C6-C7 (C in CH=C...): single →5.

C7=C8: double → counts as another bond, but it's a C=C.

Wait, so the C-C single bonds are 5.

The C=C bonds are 2.

So total C-C bonds:5 single, 2 double.

So 5*200 + 2*300 =1000 +600=1600 kJ/mol.

C-H bonds:19 → 19*400=7600.

Total: 1600+7600=9200.

Hmm, same as before. So the product's bond energy is 9200.

Reactant bond energy:8*1000 (C) +10*100 (H2)=8000+1000=9000.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molecule's structure.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of H atoms. Let me recount the H.

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So summing:

6 +1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20. So 20 H.

So the formula is C8H20.

So the reaction is 8 C +10 H2 → C8H20.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the molecule isn't C8H20. Let's check again. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's break it into each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: that's (CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C (C1, two CH3 Cs) and 7 H (6 from CH3, 1 from CH).

Then, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 H (since it's CH-).

CH2: 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, C(CH3)2 has 6 H.

So the second part contributes 2+1+2+1+6 =12 H.

Total H:7+12=19? But earlier count was 20. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the last CH=C(CH3)2 contributes 1 H (CH) and 6 H from the two CH3 groups →7 H. Then, the CH2 before it contributes 2 H. And the CH(CH3) contributes 1.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the H in the second part:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and C(CH3)2 has 6 H.

So that's 2+1=3; +2=5; +1=6; +6=12.

So second part has 12 H.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH- →7 H.

So total H:7+12=19? But earlier count was 20. So now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me think again.

In the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

How many H on each C:

C1: (CH3)2 → 6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So 6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20.

Ah, I see. So that's 20 H.

Ah, because the CH=C(CH3)2 group is at the end, so C7 is the CH in CH=C(CH3)2, which has 1 H, and C8 has two CH3 groups (6 H).

So perhaps the earlier count was correct. So the formula is C8H20.

So the reaction is 8 C + 10 H2 → C8H20.

So bond energies:

Reactants: 8 *1000 (C) + 10 *100 (H2) = 8000 +1000=9000 kJ.

Product: 9200.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product's bond energy.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't C8H20. Let me recount the structure.

Wait, another way to write the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The formula can be written as C8H14? Because each (CH3)2C=CH contributes 4 C and 7 H (each CH3 is 3 H, two CH3 groups →6, plus CH →1, and the C=CH is part of a larger structure.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C and H again.

Wait, the formula is:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: Each has 3 C (the central C and two CH3 Cs) and 7 H (6 from CH3, 1 from CH).

But then, the rest of the structure: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

This part is:

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 C, 1 H.

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (CH and C(CH3)2), and 7 H (1 from CH, 6 from C(CH3)2).

Wait, no, the CH=C(CH3)2 is a group with two C's: the CH and the C in C(CH3)2. So that's two more C's beyond the initial (CH3)2C=CH group.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C:

(CH3)2C=CH: 3 C.

Then, the next chain:

CH2: 1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C.

CH2:1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C.

So total C:3 +1 +1 +1 +2=8. Correct.

H:

(CH3)2C=CH:7 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 (from CH) + 6 (from C(CH3)2) =7 H.

So total H:7 +2 +1 +2 +7=19.

Hmm, but earlier count was 20. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the CH=C(CH3)2 group has two CH3 groups, contributing 6 H, but the CH has 1 H, so 7 H. Then, the preceding CH2 has 2 H → 2. The CH(CH3) has 1. The initial (CH3)2C=CH has 7.

So 7 (initial) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C(CH3)2) =7+2=9+1=10+2=12+7=19 H. So the formula is C8H19? But that's impossible since H must be even.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C8H14. Let me count again.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH is 4 C and 7 H.

Wait, no: (CH3)2C=CH is (CH3)2-C=CH2? No, in the given structure, it's (CH3)2C=CH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each group:

First group: (CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C, 7 H.

Then the next part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

That's:

CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C, 1 H.

CH2:1 C,2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C, 1+6=7 H.

So, C in this part:1+1+1+2=5.

H:2+1+2+7=12.

So overall:3+5=8 C, 7+12=19 H.

But 19 is odd, which is impossible for a hydrocarbon. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait, perhaps the last CH=C(CH3)2 is actually CH2=C(CH3)2?

Wait, no, the formula as given is CH=C(CH3)2, so it's CH connected to a C with two CH3 groups and double bonded.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me try again.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 H.

The molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH has 7 H.

Then, the rest: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C has two CH3 groups →6 H.

So, the second part:

CH2 (2) + CH(CH3) (1) + CH2 (2) + CH=C(CH3)2 (1+6=7) →2+1=3+2=5+7=12 H.

So total H:7+12=19. But 19 is odd. That can't be right. So perhaps the formula is C8H18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the H:

Looking at each carbon:

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So, 6+1=7, +2=9, +1=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +6=20. So 20 H.

So formula is C8H20.

But then, in the reaction, the H2 molecules needed are 10, since 20 H atoms come from 10 H2.

Wait, but 8 C and 10 H2 → C8H20.

So the bond energies:

Reactants:8 *1000 (C) +10 *100 (H2) = 9000 kJ.

Product bonds:9200 kJ.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energy calculation.

Alternative approach: maybe the question is about the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation. But the question says "enthalpy of formation".

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the elements minus the bond energies of the molecule, but maybe I have the signs reversed.

Wait, because when you form the molecule, you're releasing energy. So the formula is:

ΔH_f = sum of bonds broken (reactants) - sum of bonds formed (products).

So, (reactant bonds) - (product bonds) = 9000 -9200 = -200 kJ/mol.

Negative ΔHf suggests it's exothermic. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the formula, and it's (product bonds) - (reactant bonds).

So ΔHf = 9200 -9000 = 200 kJ/mol.

But this isn't an option either.

Looking at the options again:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → way too high.

B)67.4 kJ/mol → around 67.

C)11.44 kJ/g → about 11 kJ per gram.

D)1900 kJ/g → 1900 per gram.

Wait, but the calculation gives 200 kJ/mol, which is 200,000 kJ/g (if assuming molar mass is 1 g/mol, which it's not).

Wait, the molecular weight of C8H20 is (8*12)+(20*1) =96 +20=116 g/mol.

So 200 kJ/mol is 200 / 116 ≈ 1.724 kJ/g.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation in kJ/g, but the given options have C and D in kJ/g.

Wait, option C is 11.44 kJ/g. Which is about 11.44 *116=1325 kJ/mol.

But our calculation was 200 kJ/mol.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the question is considering the enthalpy of formation from elements in their standard states, but using bond energies, not the enthalpies of formation of the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_f = [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) of reactants] - [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) of products].

But in our case, that's 9000 -9200= -200.

But this doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the product's bond energy.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bond energies given are for breaking the bonds, so the product's bond energy is the sum of the bonds in the molecule. But when forming the molecule, the bonds are formed, which releases energy. So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bonds broken (reactants) minus the sum of bonds formed (products).

So, it's 9000 (reactant bonds) -9200 (product bonds) =-200 kJ/mol.

But this is negative, which is possible. However, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation. But the question says enthalpy of formation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, let me recount the bonds in the molecule.

C-C bonds:

Number of single C-C bonds:5.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

So 5 +2=7 C-C bonds.

Each C-C (single) is 200 kJ/mol →5*200=1000.

Each C=C is 300 →2*300=600.

So 1600.

C-H:19 *400=7600.

Total:1600+7600=9200.

Yes, correct.

Reactant bonds:8*1000 (C) +10*100 (H2)=9000.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of H atoms. Wait, perhaps there are 18 H atoms, making the formula C8H18.

If so, then:

Molecular formula C8H18.

So the reaction would be 8 C +9 H2 → C8H18.

Then, bond energies:

Reactants:8*1000 +9 *100=8000+900=8900.

Product bonds: same as before:9200.

ΔHf=8900-9200= -300.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C8H14.

Let me count again:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group →7 H.

Then, the rest: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 H (CH) +6 H (C(CH3)2) →7.

So total H:7+2=9 +1=10 +2=12 +7=19.

Wait, still 19. So perhaps the formula is C8H18, with 18 H.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → much higher than our calculation.

B)67.4 kJ/mol → around 67.

C)11.44 kJ/g → around 11 per gram.

D)1900 kJ/g → 1900 per gram.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the molecule, not the formation.

Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule to form isolated atoms. So, calculate the total bond energy of the molecule.

Which is 9200 kJ/mol. But the options don't have this.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 11200. Which is higher than 9200.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps in the molecule, each (CH3)2 group is present on both ends, contributing more C-H bonds.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the two ends are (CH3)2C=... and ...C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 contributes 6 C-H bonds. There are two such groups →12.

The CH groups contribute 1 each. There are two CH groups: the one at C2 and the one at C6 (in the middle of the chain).

Wait, perhaps I missed some CH groups.

Wait, perhaps:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has two CH3 groups and a CH.

CH2 groups: each has 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H.

So perhaps the count is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each type of C.

C1: (CH3)2 →6 H.

C2: CH →1 H.

C3: CH2 →2 H.

C4: CH(CH3) →1 H.

C5: CH2 →2 H.

C6: CH →1 H.

C7: CH →1 H.

C8: (CH3)2 →6 H.

So total H:6+1+2+1+2+1+1+6=20.

So 20 H, correct.

So, the reaction is 8 C +10 H2 → C8H20.

Bond energies:

Reactants:8*1000 +10*100=9000.

Product:9200.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the formation from elements, but from some other compounds. But the question says "enthalpy of formation of the compound", which is from elements in their standard states.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the enthalpy of formation in terms of the enthalpy of atomization, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the formula:

ΔH_f = [Σ (bond energies of product)] - [Σ (bond energies of reactants)].

But that would be 9200 -9000=200.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to take the opposite sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

ΔH_f = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of product)].

Which would give -200 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has 18 C-H bonds.

Wait, if I recount:

C1:6 → yes.

C2:1.

C3:2.

C4:1.

C5:2.

C6:1.

C7:1.

C8:6.

Total:6+1=7+2=9+1=10+2=12+1=13+1=14+6=20.

So, no, 20.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole.

But the question states bond energies in kJ/mol, so that's correct.

I'm stuck. The only option that makes sense is B)67.4, but I can't see how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is something else.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

In that case, perhaps there's an additional CH2 group, changing the structure.

But the given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the question is not about the formation of the molecule from elements, but from its constituent atoms, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol, as the energy required to form C atoms from carbon in its standard state.

So, for each C atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol to atomize.

So, the calculation would be:

Sum of bond energies of reactants (elements) minus sum of bond energies of product.

Which is:

(8 *1000) + (10 *100) - [5*200 +2*300 +19*400] = 9000 -9200= -200 kJ/mol.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ/g, not kJ/mol.

So, ΔHf is -200 kJ/mol.

Molar mass of C8H20 is (8×12)+(20×1)=96+20=116 g/mol.

So, per gram: -200 /116 ≈-1.724 kJ/g.

But it's negative, and the options have positive values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value, 1.724 kJ/g, which is about 1.7 kJ/g, but none of the options match.

Looking at the options, option C is 11.44 kJ/g. Which is much higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of H or C.

Let me think again: the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H.

The double bonds are between C1-C2 and C7-C8.

So, the molecule has 8 C atoms, 20 H atoms.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

8 C (graphite) +10 H2 (g) → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 (l) + ... ?

But the calculation remains the same.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the bond energy of H2 as 432 kJ/mol instead of 100, but the question states 100.

No, the question gives H-H as 100.

Wait, perhaps the bond energy of C-C is 1000/3 ≈333.33 kJ/mol, but no, the question gives 200.

Hmm.

Well, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer according to the calculation is -200 kJ/mol, but it's not an option. However, perhaps the intended approach was different.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation. The enthalpy of atomization would be the sum of all bond energies in the molecule, which is 9200 kJ/mol. But that's not an option either.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol.

Hmm, perhaps the approach was to calculate the number of moles of H2 used and apply a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = (number of C × 1000) + (number of H2 × 100) - [sum of product bonds].

Which is the same as before.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H2 molecules.

The molecular formula is C8H20 → H2 needed is 10.

So, 10 H2.

So, 8*1000 +10*100=9000.

Product bonds:9200.

ΔHf=9000-9200= -200.

But no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not taking into account the double bonds correctly.

Alternative approach: perhaps each double bond contributes two C-C bonds.

But no, a double bond is a single bond with two pairs, but in bond energy terms, each C=C is treated as one bond with higher energy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done per gram, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 200 kJ/mol is about 1.724 kJ/g.

But the options have C as 11.44 kJ/g, which is about 1325 kJ/mol.

So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the product's bond energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, recounting:

C1:6.

C2:1.

C3:2.

C4:1.

C5:2.

C6:1.

C7:1.

C8:6.

Total:6+1=7+2=9+1=10+2=12+1=13+1=14+6=20.

So 20 C-H bonds.

Yes.

So, 20 *400=8000.

Wait, earlier I thought 19, but now it's 20.

Wait, no, wait: 20 C-H bonds would be 20 *400=8000.

But earlier I had 19 C-H bonds, which is 7600.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. So if there are 20 C-H bonds, then:

C-C:5*200 +2*300=1000+600=1600.

C-H:20*400=8000.

Total:1600+8000=9600.

Reactants:8*1000 +10*100=9000.

ΔHf=9000-9600= -600 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but this still doesn't match any option.

Wait, but 20 C-H bonds would mean the formula is C8H20.

But earlier counts give 20 H, so that's correct.

So, 20 C-H bonds.

So product bond energy:1600+8000=9600.

ΔHf=9000-9600= -600 kJ/mol.

Still not matching options.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is B)67.4, but I can't see how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the bond energies for H-H as 432 instead of 100, but the question states 100.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies for C-C as 333 instead of 200, but no.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

The structure:

(C1)(CH3)2-C(=C2)-CH2-C3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH4-CH(=C5)(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the single bonds.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the chain is:

C1=C2-CH2-C3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C8(CH3)2.

So the single C-C bonds are between C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7.

That's five single C-C bonds.

Plus two double C=C bonds (C1-C2 and C7-C8).

So 5 +2=7 C-C bonds.

So 5 *200=1000, 2*300=600 →1600.

C-H:20 *400=8000.

Total:9600.

ΔHf=9000-9600= -600.

Still not matching.

Well, I think I've spent too much time on this. Perhaps the intended answer is B)67.4, but I can't see how to get it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. But given the options, I'll have to choose the closest.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The approach involves determining the total bond energy of the molecule and comparing it to the bond energies of the reactants (elements in their standard states).

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The molecule is analyzed to have **8 carbon atoms (C)** and **20 hydrogen atoms (H)**, giving the formula **C₈H₂₀**.

2. **Bond energy of the product (molecule)**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 5 bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 1000 kJ/mol.  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2 bonds × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.  
   - **C-H bonds**: 20 bonds × 400 kJ/mol = 8000 kJ/mol.  
   Total bond energy of the molecule = **1000 + 600 + 8000 = 9600 kJ/mol**.

3. **Bond energy of the reactants**:  
   The reactants are carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).  
   - **C (graphite)**: 8 moles × 1000 kJ/mol = 8000 kJ/mol.  
   - **H₂**: 10 moles × 100 kJ/mol = 1000 kJ/mol.  
   Total bond energy of reactants = **8000 + 1000 = 9000 kJ/mol**.

4. **Calculate enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f)**:  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Bond energy of reactants} - \text{Bond energy of product}
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 9000 - 9600 = -600 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Convert to kJ/g (if required)**:  
   The molar mass of **C₈H₂₀** is:  
   \[
   (8 \times 12) + (20 \times 1) = 116 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   Per gram:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \frac{-600}{116} \approx -5.17 \, \text{kJ/g}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**: This is far too high compared to the calculated value.  
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This does not match the calculated value of -600 kJ/mol.  
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**: This corresponds to approximately 1325 kJ/mol, which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: This is far too high and inconsistent with the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is **-600 kJ/mol**, but none of the provided options match this value. Based on the given options, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** is the closest plausible answer, though the reasoning for this discrepancy is unclear.
