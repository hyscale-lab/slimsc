Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, I remember that this is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. So the force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kr and in this case, k would be m ω².

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, each energy level corresponds to certain states, and the number of states (eigenfunctions) depends on the degeneracy of that energy level.

I think in a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω, where n is the total quantum number. Or wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of n_x, n_y, n_z. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħ ω, so the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħ ω. But I also remember that the energy can be expressed in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers. Let's think: in 3D, the principal quantum number n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. And the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω.

Wait, no, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2). So adding them: (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) + (n_z + 1/2) = (n_x + n_y + n_z) + 3/2 = n + 3/2. So yes, E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the third excited state... Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0, right? Because the ground state has n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0. The first excited state would have n=1, the second n=2, the third n=3. So the third excited state is when the sum n=3.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think again: the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So yes, third excited state is n=3.

So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħ ω = (9/2) ħ ω. So that's 9/2 times ħ ω. Looking at the options, looking for that. Option A is (9/2) ħ ω, and option C is the same. So the energy part in options A and C is correct.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for this energy eigenvalue? That's the degeneracy, how many different states have the same energy E.

The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator at a given n is given by the number of ways you can write n as the sum of three non-negative integers (since each n_x, n_y, n_z must be ≥0). So for each n, the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2), but wait, is that correct?

Wait, more precisely, the degeneracy is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Or is it (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. Let's think: for n=3, the number of combinations is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, it's (3 + 2) choose 2 = 5 choose 2 =10. So the degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

So looking back at the options, option A says the energy is (9/2) ħ ω and 10 eigenfunctions. So A is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. The third excited state is when n=3. So E = (3 + 3/2) ħ ω = 4.5 ħ ω or 9/2 ħ ω. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by $E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number. Here, $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.

The third excited state corresponds to $n = 3$, as the ground state is $n = 0$, the first excited state is $n = 1$, the second excited state is $n = 2$, and the third excited state is $n = 3$. Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given energy level in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to write $n$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$. This is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

For $n = 3$, the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$.**
