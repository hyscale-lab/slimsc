Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is an atomic nucleus with mass M at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. I think I remember that in nuclear fission, energy is released because the binding energy of the nucleus is higher than the sum of the binding energies of the fragments. But wait, this is about rest masses. Oh, right, the rest mass of the original nucleus is M, and after fission, the total rest mass of the two fragments is less than M because some mass is converted into energy. The problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, so 0.99 M. That means 1% of M is converted into other forms of energy, like kinetic and possibly other particles, but the question says to ignore electrons, so maybe it's just kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says the sum of the rest-masses is 99% of M. So, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the fragments. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the heavier is 2m. So together, m + 2m = 3m. And this equals 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3. Thus, the heavier fragment has mass 2m = (2 * 0.99 M)/3 = (1.98 M)/3 = 0.66 M each? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3m is 0.99 M, so m is 0.33 M, and 2m is 0.66 M. Wait, 0.33 plus 0.66 is 0.99 M. Right.

Now, the nucleus was initially at rest. So, after fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. But wait, in reality, since the problem is about rest masses and kinetic energy, and considering relativistic effects, maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum, and then calculate the kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So we need to find T1, the relativistic kinetic energy, and compare it with the non-relativistic approximation. The difference between the two is what we're after.

In the non-relativistic case, we can use the classical formula for kinetic energy, which is (1/2) m v². But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So, first, I think I should find the velocities or the energies using the conservation laws.

Let me think about the two fragments. Let’s denote fragment 1 as the more massive one (mass 2m) and fragment 2 as the lighter (mass m). Since the system is at rest, their momenta must be equal and opposite. So, relativistic momentum is gamma m v. So for fragment 1: gamma1 * (2m) * v1. For fragment 2: gamma2 * m * v2. And since they are in opposite directions, their magnitudes must be equal: gamma1 *2m v1 = gamma2 m v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But because in the fission process, the fragments are moving apart, maybe we can assume that the velocities are such that the total momentum is zero. But that equation relates the gammas and velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the conservation of energy. The total energy before is the rest energy, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

So, the initial energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. The final energy is (2m c² + T1) + (m c² + T2), where T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T2 of the lighter.

Wait, the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M, 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the rest mass of the original nucleus. So 2m = 0.66 M, and m = 0.33 M.

So, the rest energy of fragment 1 is 0.66 M c², fragment 2 is 0.33 M c².

So, the total rest energy of the two is 0.99 M c². The initial energy was M c² = 300 GeV. So the difference is 0.01 M c², which is (300 GeV)(0.01) = 3 GeV. So that energy must be converted into kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The initial rest energy is M c² = 300 GeV. The final rest energy is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. So the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But wait, the problem says to ignore electrons, so perhaps other particles are not involved, and all the released mass-energy goes into kinetic energy of the two fragments. So we can say that the sum of their KEs is 3 GeV.

Now, but we need to find the KE of the more massive fragment, T1, and compare the correct T1 (relativistic) with the non-relativistic approximation. So the difference is T1 (relativistic) - T1 (classical).

So, how do we find T1?

Let me think about the relativistic scenario.

In the rest frame of the nucleus, the two fragments are moving in opposite directions with velocities v1 and v2, such that their momenta are equal and opposite.

So, momentum conservation: gamma1 * (2m) * v1 = gamma2 * m * v2.

Let me write this as equation (1): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Also, energy conservation: (gamma1 (2m) c²) + (gamma2 m c²) = 300 GeV.

Because the initial energy was Mc² = 300 GeV.

So, equation (2): 2 gamma1 m c² + gamma2 m c² = 300 GeV.

But we know m = 0.33 M, so 2m = 0.66 M. So, substituting m = (0.33 M)/ c²? Wait, no, perhaps I should write m in terms of M. Let me think: m = 0.33 M / (c²). No, wait, m is the rest mass, so m c² is the rest energy. So m = (0.33 M c²)/(c²) ) → m = 0.33 M. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of M and c².

Wait, let's define m in terms of M: m = (0.33 M) / (c²) ? No, perhaps not. Because M is the rest mass. So, let's think in terms of energy: M c² is 300 GeV.

m is 0.33 M, so m c² is 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV. Similarly, 2m c² is 198 GeV.

So, equation (2): 2 gamma1 (99 GeV) + gamma2 (99 GeV) = 300 GeV.

Simplify equation (2): 99 GeV (2 gamma1 + gamma2) ) = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300 /99 ≈ 3.0303.

So 2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.03.

Now, equation (1): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but I also need to relate the velocities. Alternatively, perhaps I can express v2 in terms of v1 via equation (1). Let me rearrange equation (1):

gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1 → v2 = (2 gamma1 v1) / gamma2.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are not too high, but wait, in reality, fission fragments are moving at relativistic speeds? Not sure. But the problem is about the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations, so perhaps for the non-relativistic case, we can calculate the velocities, then compute the KE, and then compare with the correct relativistic KE.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the system in terms of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the speed of fragment 1 as v, and fragment 2 as u. Then, from momentum conservation:

gamma(v) * (2m) * v = gamma(u) * m * u.

Since the momentum of fragment 1 is opposite to that of fragment 2, but in magnitude, they are equal.

So, 2 gamma(v) v = gamma(u) u → equation (3).

And from energy: 2 gamma(v) m c² + gamma(u) m c² = M c² = 300 GeV.

As before, m c² is 99 GeV, so:

2 gamma(v) * 99 GeV + gamma(u) *99 GeV = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV:

2 gamma(v) + gamma(u) = 300 /99 ≈ 3.0303.

So, equation (4): 2 gamma(v) + gamma(u) ≈ 3.0303.

So now, I have two equations: equation (3) and equation (4).

But this seems a bit complicated to solve. Maybe I can make an assumption about the velocities, but probably it's better to relate gamma(u) and gamma(v) via equation (3), then substitute into equation (4).

From equation (3):

gamma(u) u = 2 gamma(v) v.

Hmm, but it's hard to solve this directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the lighter fragment has a higher speed since it's less massive. So perhaps u is much larger than v. But that might not hold. Alternatively, maybe we can make an approximation that one of the gammas is much larger than the other, but that's risky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma(u) in terms of gamma(v) and v.

Wait, let's express equation (3) as:

gamma(u) = [2 gamma(v) v ] / u.

Substituting into equation (4):

2 gamma(v) + [2 gamma(v) v ] / u = 3.0303.

Hmm, but I don't know u. This seems tricky. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, let's think about the non-relativistic case first, then compare. Because that might give me an idea.

In the non-relativistic case, the velocities are small compared to c, so gamma ≈ 1. So, equation (3) becomes 2 v1 = v2.

And equation (4) becomes 2 *1 + 1 = 3, which is exactly 3, but our equation (4) is approximately 3.03, which is a bit more. So, the non-relativistic case gives 3 = 3.03, which is a bit off, so the relativistic case must have a slightly higher value.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, 2 v1 = v2.

Then, from energy: 2*(1/2)*(2m) v1² + (1/2)*m v2² = 3 GeV.

Since the kinetic energy is 3 GeV as calculated before.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic case, T1 = (1/2)(2m) v1², T2 = (1/2) m v2².

But from equation (3): v2 = 2 v1.

So, substituting v2 = 2 v1 into the kinetic energy equation:

(1/2)(2m) v1² + (1/2) m (2 v1)^2 =3 GeV.

Simplify:

( m v1² ) + ( (1/2) m *4 v1² ) = 3 GeV.

Which is m v1² + 2 m v1² = 3 GeV → 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

But m is 0.33 M, which is  0.33 * 300 GeV / c²? Wait, no, m is 0.33 M, and M c² is 300 GeV, so m c² is 99 GeV. So m = 99 GeV / c².

So, m v1² = (99 GeV / c²) v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV c² ) / (99 GeV) ) → v1² = c² / 99 → v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c / 9.9499 ≈ 0.1005 c.

So v1 is about 0.1c.

Then, v2 would be 2 v1 ≈ 0.2c.

So, the kinetic energies are:

T1 (non-rel) = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1² = (99 GeV/c²) * (c² / 99) ) → 99 GeV * (1/99) )= 1 GeV.

Similarly, T2 (non-rel) = (1/2) m (v2)^2 = (1/2) m (4 v1²) ) = 2 m v1² = 2*(1 GeV) = 2 GeV.

So T1 is 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV, which matches.

But in reality, the velocities are higher, so the kinetic energies would be higher due to relativistic effects.

Wait, because in reality, the KE is higher because of the gamma factors.

So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

So, for fragment 1: T1 = (gamma1 -1) * 99 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = (gamma2 -1 ) *99 GeV.

And T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1 + gamma2 -1 ) *99 =3 → (gamma1 + gamma2 -2 ) *99=3 → gamma1 + gamma2 = 3/99 +2 ≈ 0.0303 +2 = 2.0303.

Wait, but from equation (4), 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

So, we have two equations:

Equation (4): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

Equation (5): gamma1 + gamma2 =2.0303.

Subtract equation (5) from equation (4):

(2 gamma1 + gamma2) - (gamma1 + gamma2) )=3.0303 -2.0303 → gamma1 =1.

Wait, gamma1 =1? That can't be right, because if gamma1 is 1, then velocity v1 is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me check my equations.

Wait, equation (5) is from the sum of the kinetic energies:

T1 + T2 = (gamma1 -1 + gamma2 -1) m c² =3 GeV.

Wait, m c² is 99 GeV, so:

(gamma1 + gamma2 -2 ) *99 GeV =3 GeV → gamma1 + gamma2 -2 =3/99 → gamma1 + gamma2 = 2 + 3/99 ≈ 2.0303.

Equation (4): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

Subtract equation (5) from equation (4):

(2 gamma1 + gamma2) - (gamma1 + gamma2) )=3.0303-2.0303 → gamma1 =1.

Which implies gamma1=1. So v1=0.

Wait, that can't be correct because that would mean the heavier fragment isn't moving, which would make the lighter fragment have all the momentum. But according to the problem statement, both fragments are moving, so this suggests a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, in equation (4), I had 2 gamma1 m c² + gamma2 m c² =300 GeV.

But m c² is 99 GeV, so 2 gamma1 (99) + gamma2 (99) =300 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =300 → dividing both sides by 99: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =300/99 ≈3.0303.

And equation (5) is gamma1 + gamma2 =2.0303.

So subtracting equation (5) from equation (4):

gamma1= 3.0303 -2.0303=1.

So gamma1=1, which means v1=0. That's impossible because the heavier fragment can't remain stationary.

So where is the mistake?

Ah, wait, no. Because in the relativistic scenario, the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies must equal the initial rest energy. Wait, no, no, the initial energy is Mc² =300 GeV. The final energy is sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, the rest energy after fission is 0.99 Mc² = 297 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, as before.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So, the sum of the kinetic energies is (gamma1 -1 + gamma2 -1) *99 GeV =3 GeV → (gamma1 + gamma2 -2) *99 =3 → gamma1 + gamma2 =2.0303.

But from equation (4), 2 gamma1 + gamma2=3.0303.

Subtracting equation (5) (gamma1 + gamma2=2.0303) from equation (4):

gamma1 =1.

So, that would imply gamma1=1, which as I said earlier, implies v1=0. That can't be the case, so perhaps something's wrong with the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the rest masses. Let me double-check that.

The problem says that the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So 3m =0.99 M → m=0.33 M.

Wait, but m is the rest mass of each fragment? No, no. One fragment is more massive. Let me re-express.

Let me let the mass of fragment A be 2m, fragment B be m.

So 2m + m =3m=0.99 M → m=0.33 M.

Ah, that's correct. So fragment A (heavier) has mass 0.66 M, fragment B 0.33 M.

So, their rest energies are 0.66 M c^2 and 0.33 M c^2.

Which, given M c^2=300 GeV, fragment A has 198 GeV rest energy, fragment B 99 GeV.

So, equation (4) is 2 gamma1 *198 GeV + gamma2 *99 GeV =300 GeV.

Wait, no. Equation (4) is the total energy after fission.

So, fragment A's total energy is gamma1 * (0.66 M c²) → but wait, M c² is 300 GeV, so fragment A's rest energy is 0.66 *300 GeV =198 GeV.

Similarly, fragment B's rest energy is 99 GeV.

So, fragment A's total energy is gamma1 *198 GeV, fragment B's is gamma2 *99 GeV.

Thus, equation (4): gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 =300.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 =300/99 ≈3.0303.

Equation (5): the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

So, KE_A = gamma1 *198 -198 =198 (gamma1 -1).

KE_B = gamma2 *99 -99 =99 (gamma2 -1).

So, 198 (gamma1-1) +99 (gamma2-1) =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 (gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) = 3/99 → 2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 = 1/33 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3 + 3/33.

Wait, 3/99 is 1/33, so 2 (g1-1) + (g2-1) = 1/33 → 2 g1 -2 + g2 -1 = 1/33 → 2 g1 + g2 = 3 + 1/33 = 100/33 ≈3.0303.

Wait, but that's the same as equation (4): 2 gamma1 + gamma2=100/33≈3.0303.

Hmm, so equation (5) from KE sum doesn't give a new equation but the same as equation (4). So I have only one equation and two unknowns. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but we have another equation from momentum conservation.

Momentum of fragment A is gamma1 * (momentum of rest mass) = gamma1 * (0.66 M) * v1.

Wait, no, relativistic momentum is gamma m v. So, fragment A's momentum is gamma1 * (0.66 M) * v1 /c²? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of units.

Wait, M is the rest mass, so M c² is energy in GeV. So, m is in GeV/c².

Wait, fragment A's rest mass is 0.66 M → as in, 0.66 times M. So, m_A=0.66 M, m_B=0.33 M.

So, their rest energies are 0.66 M c² =198 GeV, 0.33 M c²=99 GeV.

So, the momentum of fragment A is gamma1 * m_A * v1 = gamma1 * (0.66 M) * v1.

Similarly, fragment B's momentum is gamma2 * (0.33 M) * v2.

But since momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the two momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

gamma1 *0.66 M v1 = gamma2 *0.33 M v2.

Divide both sides by M:

gamma1 *0.66 v1 = gamma2 *0.33 v2.

Multiply both sides by 2 to simplify:

2 gamma1 * 0.66 v1 = 2 gamma2 *0.33 v2 → (1.32 gamma1 v1) =0.66 gamma2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So, equation (3): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Now, we have:

Equation (4): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

Equation (3): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

And we need to relate v1 and v2, perhaps via equation (3).

But this seems challenging because we have two variables, gamma1 and gamma2, and their velocities. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the velocities in terms of a single variable.

Let me assume that the velocities are along the same line, and opposite in direction, so I can set v1 as positive and v2 as negative (or vice versa), but let me just consider their magnitudes.

Let me think: perhaps I can express v2 in terms of v1 via equation (3).

From equation (3): gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1 → v2 = (2 gamma1 v1 )/gamma2.

But we have equation (4): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

So, perhaps I can denote gamma2 =3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Substituting into the expression for v2:

v2 = (2 gamma1 v1 )/(3.0303 -2 gamma1).

Hmm, but this still leaves me with variables to solve for.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v1 in terms of gamma1.

Because v = c sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2).

So, v1 = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²).

Similarly, v2 = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

But substituting into equation (3) seems complicated.

Wait, equation (3): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Expressed in terms of gamma and v:

2 gamma1 * c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²) = gamma2 * c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

Cancel c:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1-1/gamma2²).

Square both sides:

4 gamma1² (1 - 1/gamma1²) = gamma2² (1-1/gamma2²).

Simplify:

4 gamma1² ( (gamma1² -1)/gamma1² ) ) = gamma2² ( (gamma2² -1)/gamma2² )

So:

4 (gamma1² -1) = gamma2² -1.

→ 4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1.

→ gamma2² =4 gamma1² -3.

Hmm, so now we have gamma2² =4 gamma1² -3.

But from equation (4), gamma2 =3.0303 -2 gamma1.

So, substituting into the equation:

(3.0303 -2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1² -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2 *3.0303 *2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Compute (3.0303)^2: 3.0303^2 ≈9.182.

So:

9.182 - 12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1² =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Subtract 4 gamma1^2 from both sides:

9.182 -12.1212 gamma1 = -3.

Bring all terms to one side:

9.182 +3 -12.1212 gamma1 =0 → 12.182 -12.1212 gamma1 =0.

→ 12.1212 gamma1=12.182 → gamma1≈12.182/(12.1212)= approx 1.005.

Wait, so gamma1 is approximately 1.005.

So, gamma1 ≈1.005.

Then, from equation (4): gamma2=3.0303-2 *1.005=3.0303-2.01=1.0203.

So, gamma2≈1.0203.

So, now we can compute the velocities.

v1 = c sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²).

gamma1=1.005 → gamma1^2=1.010025.

So, 1/gamma1^2=0.99005 →1 -0.99005=0.00995.

sqrt(0.00995)=approx 0.09975.

So, v1≈0.09975 c → about 0.1c.

v2= c sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2).

gamma2=1.0203 → gamma2^2≈1.0409.

1/gamma2^2≈0.961.

1-0.961=0.039.

sqrt(0.039)=approx 0.1975.

So, v2≈0.1975 c.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

gamma1=1.005 → gamma1-1=0.005 → T1=0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

Similarly, T2=(gamma2-1)*99 GeV.

gamma2-1=0.0203 → T2=0.0203 *99=approx 2.0097 GeV.

So, T1 ≈0.99 GeV, T2≈2.01 GeV. Sum is about 3 GeV, which matches.

Now, in the non-relativistic approximation, earlier calculation gave T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV. So the relativistic T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is slightly less than the non-relativistic value of 1 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because in reality, T1 is higher in relativistic cases. Hmm, but wait, the non-relativistic calculation gives T1=1 GeV, but relativistic gives 0.99 GeV? That would mean the correct T1 is lower than the non-relativistic case, so the difference would be negative, but the options are positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Oh wait, no. Because in the non-relativistic case, the calculation was based on gamma=1. So the non-relativistic T1 is (1/2)(2m) v1².

Which, from earlier, when gamma=1, v1 was c/sqrt(99) ≈0.1c, and T1 was 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic calculation, T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 0.01 GeV less than the non-relativistic value. So the correct T1 is lower than the non-relativistic approximation by about 10 MeV.

Wait, 0.01 GeV is 10 MeV.

So the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is 10 MeV.

But wait, the question is: what is the difference between the correct T1 and the T1 calculated using the classical approximation?

In the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV (1000 MeV).

In the relativistic case, it's 0.99 GeV → 990 MeV.

So the difference is 10 MeV, correct value is lower by 10 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 990 MeV, non-relativistic is 1000 MeV. So the difference is 10 MeV.

So the answer would be 10 MeV, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using relativistic and non-relativistic mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments: one with twice the rest mass of the other. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 0.99 M \), meaning \( 1\% \) of the initial mass is converted into kinetic energy.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses of fragments**:
   - Let the lighter fragment have rest mass \( m \). The heavier fragment has rest mass \( 2m \).
   - Total rest mass: \( 2m + m = 3m = 0.99M \), so \( m = 0.33M \) and \( 2m = 0.66M \).
   - Rest energies: \( 2m c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Energy conservation**:
   - Initial energy: \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Final energy: Total rest energy of fragments \( + \) total kinetic energy.
   - Total rest energy after fission: \( 198 \, \text{GeV} + 99 \, \text{GeV} = 297 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Total kinetic energy released: \( 300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:
   - The kinetic energy of a fragment is given by:
     \[
     T = (\gamma - 1) m c^2
     \]
     where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
   - For the heavier fragment (mass \( 2m \)), the relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) is compared to the non-relativistic approximation \( T_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v^2 \).

### Relativistic Calculation:
1. **Momentum conservation**:
   - Since the system is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Let the heavier fragment move with velocity \( v_1 \) and the lighter fragment with velocity \( v_2 \). The magnitudes of their relativistic momenta are equal:
     \[
     \gamma_1 (2m) v_1 = \gamma_2 m v_2
     \]
     where \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \) are the Lorentz factors for the heavier and lighter fragments, respectively.

2. **Energy conservation**:
   - The total energy after fission is:
     \[
     \gamma_1 (2m c^2) + \gamma_2 (m c^2) = M c^2
     \]
     Substituting \( m c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \):
     \[
     198 \gamma_1 + 99 \gamma_2 = 300
     \]
     Dividing through by \( 99 \):
     \[
     2 \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 = 3.0303
     \]

3. **Solving for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \)**:
   - Using the momentum conservation equation and the energy conservation equation, we solve for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \). After solving, we find:
     \[
     \gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0203
     \]

4. **Kinetic energy of the heavier fragment**:
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:
     \[
     T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) (2m c^2) = (1.005 - 1) \cdot 198 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}
     \]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation:
1. **Non-relativistic kinetic energy**:
   - Using the classical formula \( T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \), the non-relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:
     \[
     T_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v^2
     \]
   - From earlier calculations, \( v_1 \approx 0.1c \), so:
     \[
     T_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} (2m) (0.1c)^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}
     \]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Values:
- The relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \) is slightly less than the non-relativistic value \( T_{1,\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).
- The difference is:
  \[
  \Delta T = T_{1,\text{classical}} - T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}
  \]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic approximation is **10 MeV**.
