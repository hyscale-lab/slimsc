Okay, so I've got this question about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that this reaction involves converting a pinacol into pinacolone under acidic conditions. Pinacol has two adjacent alcohol groups, right?

The question gives two reactions and asks about the starting materials and products. Let's break it down.

The first reaction is A + H2SO4 → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, A is the starting material, and the product is a ketone. Since it's a pinacol rearrangement, A must have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. 

The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. The numbering suggests that the ketone is at position 1, and positions 2 have two p-tolyl groups. So, I'm thinking the starting material must have had two hydroxyls on adjacent carbons, maybe on a cyclohexane ring. 

Wait, pinacol structure is like two adjacent CH(OH) groups. So for the product to be 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexanone, the starting material would be a cyclohexanol derivative with adjacent hydroxyls, but where are the substituents?

Wait, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the substituents (p-tolyl groups) are on the same carbon (carbon 2) of the cyclohexane ring. So that carbon must have been where the two hydroxyls were in the starting material.

So, looking at the starting material A. It should be a cyclohexanol with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. So A would be something like diol, 1,2-diol, but on a cyclohexane ring. But the options for A are:

Option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, let me visualize that structure. So, if it's cyclohexanol, the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. Then there's another group, a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group attached to the same carbon. Wait, no. 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol would have two hydroxyl groups on the same carbon, perhaps? Or is it a geminal diol?

No, wait, maybe not. Let me think. The molecule A is a pinacol, so it must have two adjacent diols. So if the structure is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, that would mean the cyclohexane ring has a hydroxyl group on carbon 1, and attached to that carbon is a CH(OH) group with two p-tolyl substituents. So the structure would be like:

The cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached to it, but wait, no. Wait, 1-(something)cyclohexan-1-ol means that the substituent is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. So the substituent is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group. So the structure would be the cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH) group attached, and that CH(OH) has two p-tolyl groups attached to the CH.

Wait, that would make the structure have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. Because the cyclohexan-1-ol has an OH on carbon 1, and the substituent is another CH(OH) with p-tolyl groups. So that would make the two hydroxyls adjacent. Because the substituent is attached to carbon 1, which has an OH, and the substituent itself is a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group.

So, when this undergoes the pinacol rearrangement, under acid conditions, one OH gets protonated, then a 1,2-hydride shift occurs, leading to the formation of a ketone.

In this case, the starting material has two OHs on adjacent carbons (carbon 1 and the substituent's CH). When rearranged, the ketone would form. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on carbon 1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on carbon 2.

So, the process would involve taking the group from the CH(OH) and moving it to the adjacent carbon, creating the ketone.

I'm trying to imagine the mechanism. Protonation of one of the OH groups (say, the one on the substituent's CH) would make it a better leaving group. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon (cyclohexan-1-ol's carbon) to the adjacent carbon (the substituent's CH). Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to the migration of a group from one carbon to another. So, the starting material has two adjacent diols, each attached to a carbon. When the acid catalyzes, one of the OH is protonated, and then the adjacent H (hydride) shifts, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then forms the ketone.

Wait, in the pinacol rearrangement, the two adjacent diols lose water, forming a carbocation, which then undergoes a hydride shift to form a ketone.

No, wait, maybe it's a different mechanism. Let me remember: the pinacol rearrangement involves the protonation of an -OH group, making it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent hydrogen (from the same carbon as the other -OH) is abstracted as a water molecule, leading to the formation of a carbocation. Then, a 1,2-hydride shift occurs, resulting in a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that after protonation of one OH, the adjacent OH leaves as water, creating a carbocation, which then undergoes a hydride shift to form a more stable carbonyl group.

In any case, the product ends up with a ketone, and the substituents have shifted positions.

So, back to the first reaction: the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on carbon 1, and carbons 2 has two p-tolyl groups.

So, the starting material A must have two adjacent hydroxyl groups on a ring. The substituent is a p-tolyl group attached to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol where one of the OHs is on a cyclohexane ring and the other is on a CH group connected to that ring. So, for example, cyclohexan-1-ol with a 1,2-dihydroxy substituent attached.

Wait, looking at the options, option A's starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the cyclohexane has a hydroxyl on carbon 1, and that same carbon has a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group attached.

When the rearrangement occurs, the adjacent OHs will lose a water, leading to a carbocation. The hydride shift would move from the cyclohexane ring to the adjacent CH, leading to the formation of a ketone.

So, the product would have the ketone on the original cyclohexane carbon (now 1), and the two p-tolyl groups would be on the adjacent carbon (now 2). That matches the product given.

So A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which is option A or D.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option D: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

So first reaction's product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which comes from A being option A or D.

Now, looking at the second reaction: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 → B.

So the starting material here is a diol ester: methyl ester, 2,3-dihydroxy, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 2.

So, the structure would be OMe-O-C-OH attached to the butanoate chain, but wait, no.

Wait, the structure is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the butanoate is CH2-C(OH)-C(OH)-CH2-O-Me, but wait, butanoate is four carbons. So:

The structure is:
CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-C(OH)-CH2-O-Me ?

Wait, no. Butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COO- but in this case, it's 2,3-dihydroxy-2-p-tolyl. So the structure is:

The butanoate is: OMe-O-C-O- group attached to a four-carbon chain. The four carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: attached to p-tolyl and two OH groups.

Wait, maybe not. Let me correct: the butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COO- but with substituents on carbons 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps it's:

The butanoate is:

CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-O-Me.

Wait, but the p-tolyl is on carbon 2. So the actual structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2-O-Me.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. The correct structure is:

The butanoate is:

The ester is methyl, so the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, the butanoate is four carbons in the chain, with the ester on the first carbon.

So the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-p-tolyl? No, the p-tolyl is on the same carbon as the diol.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The butanoate would be:

CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-O-Me, but the p-tolyl is on the same carbon as the second CH(OH). So it's:

CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH2-O-Me.

Wait, no, the butanoate would be:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1.

Carbon 2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl).

Carbon 3: CH(OH).

Carbon 4: CH2-?

Wait, no. Let me count: butanoate is four carbons. So, carbon 1 is the COOCH3 group. Carbon 2 is the next, which has the substituents. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)- ?

Wait, perhaps another way. The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, the butanoate is: CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the chain as:

COOCH3 is on the end, then CH(OH), then CH(OH)(p-tolyl), then CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the four carbons are arranged as:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl).

Carbon 3: CH(OH).

Carbon 4: CH3? No, because butanoate is four carbons in the chain, so it's:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-? No, maybe not.

Wait, I think the structure is:

The butanoate is: O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)- ?

Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps it's:

O=C(OCH3)-CH(CH2OH)(p-tolyl)-CH2- ?

I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I can focus on the reaction.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol (two adjacent OH groups) will rearrange into a ketone. So for the starting material here, it's a diol attached to an ester group.

So, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

After the rearrangement, product B would have a ketone where the diol was.

So, the diol is on carbons 2 and 3 of the butanoate chain.

When the rearrangement occurs, the two adjacent OHs lose water, and a hydride shift occurs.

So, the most likely product is a ketone at one of those positions, and the p-tolyl group would migrate.

Wait, let me think about the product.

In the starting material, the diol is on carbons 2 and 3. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-R? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the carbons are:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1.

Carbon 2 has a CH(OH)(p-tolyl).

Carbon 3 has a CH(OH).

Carbon 4 is attached to something else, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

When the Pinacol rearrangement happens, the two OHs (on C2 and C3) would lose a water molecule each, leading to a carbocation or a shift.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester is on C1, then C2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), and C3 is CH(OH).

So, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (C2 and C3), so that's the diol.

Under acidic conditions, they would protonate, lose water, and undergo a shift.

The Pinacol rearrangement would typically form a ketone, so which position would that be?

In the reaction, the diol would lose two water molecules (but wait, maybe only one water is lost), leading to a carbocation. Then a hydride shift occurs to form the more stable carbonyl group.

In this case, since the diol is on C2 and C3, after the shift, the ketone would form on either C2 or C3, depending on where the shift happens.

Wait, perhaps the structure after rearrangement would have the ketone on C2 or C3.

Alternatively, the p-tolyl group is on C2, and when the shift occurs, it moves to C3, but no, wait.

Alternatively, when the diol is in positions 2 and 3, the shift would cause the ketone to form on one of those carbons. Let's imagine the shift occurs such that the p-tolyl group moves to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe the product would be a methyl ester with a ketone on C3 and a p-tolyl on C2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the options for B:

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So that would be the ester with a ketone (oxo) on C3, and a p-tolyl on C2.

Wait, so the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO- ?

Wait, no, but let me think. The butanoate is four carbons. So:

If the ketone is on C3, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's:

COOCH3-CH2-C(O)CH2-?

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. That would have the ketone on C3 and the p-tolyl on C2.

Alternatively, another option is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, which suggests a branch.

Wait, the starting material is a butanoate, which is four carbons. After rearrangement, the product could have a shorter chain if a carbon is lost, but in the Pinacol rearrangement, a hydride shifts, but the chain length remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone on C3, and the p-tolyl on C2. So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-CH2-O-Me? No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, the product would be 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which would be:

CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no, that's only three carbons. Hmm.

Wait, but butanoate is four carbons. So 3-oxo would imply the ketone is on C3, so the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH(O)-CH2- ?

No, that's not correct. Let me try again.

Butanoate is four carbons: C1 (COOCH3), C2, C3, C4.

If the starting material is 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl), then C2 has an OH and a p-tolyl, C3 has an OH.

So, when rearrangement occurs, the diol (C2 and C3) would lose water, and the p-tolyl would shift.

Wait, perhaps the p-tolyl is on C2, and the OHs are on C2 and C3. So when the shift occurs, the p-tolyl moves to C3, and the ketone is formed on C2.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-p-tolyl? No, that can't be. Or perhaps:

COOCH3-CH(p-tolyl)-C(O)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think that after the rearrangement, the p-tolyl group ends up on C3, and the ketone is on C2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should think about the options.

Looking at the options for B:

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option C: B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Option D: B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Wait, the starting material is a butanoate (four carbons). If the product is a propanoate (three carbons), that would imply a loss of a carbon, but the Pinacol rearrangement doesn't remove a carbon; it just rearranges the substituents.

So, if option C and D have propanoate, which is three carbons, that might not be the case here because the starting material is a four-carbon butanoate.

So, the product should be a four-carbon compound, which rules out options C and D for B.

So, B must be in option A or B.

Wait, looking back, the options for B:

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option B: same as A.

Wait, no, let me look again.

The options are:

A) A is ... B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

B) A is ... B is same.

Wait, no, the options are:

Option A: A = ..., B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option B: A = ..., B = same.

Option C: A = ..., B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Option D: A = ..., B = same as C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So the starting material for the second reaction is a butanoate, and the product is B.

If in the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OHs on C2 and C3 would rearrange into a ketone. So, the product would have a ketone on C2 or C3.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. That would fit option A or B.

But in the given options, only options A and B have B as that product.

Wait, but option B's product is the same as option A's B.

So, looking back, the first reaction's A is either cyclohexanol or cyclopentanol derivative.

In option A, A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, which would produce the correct product for the first reaction.

For the second reaction, the starting material is a butanoate diol, and the product is a ketone, so option A's B is correct.

So now, let's match the options.

Option A: A is cyclohexanol derivative, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, for the first reaction, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be either A or B, but let me check the other options.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the second reaction again.

The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1.

Carbon 2 has a CH(OH)(p-tolyl).

Carbon 3 has a CH(OH).

Carbon 4 is perhaps a CH3 or another group.

But in any case, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons 2 and 3.

Upon rearrangement, the product would have a ketone formed. The diol converts to a ketone.

After the rearrangement, the p-tolyl group and the ketone would be positioned where?

In the pinacol rearrangement, the two OHs lose a water, and a hydride shift occurs. So, the group adjacent to the diol moves to the adjacent position.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation forms on C2 or C3, and a hydride shift occurs from C1 or C4.

Wait, maybe the shift moves a hydrogen from C3 to C2, resulting in the ketone on C2, and the p-tolyl group remains on C2.

Wait, no, perhaps the shift moves the p-tolyl group to C3, and the ketone forms on C2.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone on C3, with the p-tolyl on C2. So the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Which matches option A and B for B.

So, looking at the options, option A's B is correct, and the first reaction's A is correct.

Now, looking at the options, I'll check what each option says.

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So both reactions would have correct products.

But wait, for the second reaction, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, so the product B would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

That fits option A's B.

So, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but I should also check the other options.

Option B: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, which would produce a different product. Because if A is a cyclopentanol derivative, the product would be 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclopentan-1-one, but the product given is cyclohexanone, so option B might not be correct.

Similarly, options C and D have different B products, which are propanoates, which I think are incorrect because the starting material is a butanoate.

So, the correct option is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves the conversion of a pinacol (a molecule with two adjacent alcohol groups) into a pinacolone (a ketone) under acidic conditions. The reaction proceeds via protonation of one alcohol group, loss of water, and a 1,2-hydride shift, resulting in the formation of a ketone.

### Reaction 1:  
**A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**  
- The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which is a ketone with two p-tolyl groups on carbon 2 and the ketone group on carbon 1 of a cyclohexane ring.  
- For this product to form, the starting material **A** must be a pinacol with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. The structure of **A** must allow for the rearrangement to produce the given ketone.  
- Among the options, **A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol** fits this requirement. This structure has two adjacent hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring, which can undergo the rearrangement to form the product.

### Reaction 2:  
**Methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B**  
- The starting material is a diol ester with hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of a butanoate chain, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2.  
- Under acidic conditions, the two hydroxyl groups undergo the Pinacol rearrangement, leading to the formation of a ketone. The p-tolyl group remains on carbon 2, and the ketone forms on carbon 3.  
- The product **B** is therefore **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, which matches the description of the rearrangement.

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **Option A:**  
  - **A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**, which correctly produces 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one.  
  - **B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, which is the correct product of the second reaction.  
  - This option is consistent with both reactions.  

- **Option B:**  
  - **A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**, which would produce a cyclopentanone product, not the cyclohexanone product given.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

- **Option C:**  
  - **B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate**, which is a propanoate, but the starting material is a butanoate.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

- **Option D:**  
  - **B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate**, same as in Option C, and is incorrect for the same reason.  

### Conclusion:  
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it provides the correct starting materials and products for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
