Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons are subatomic, and when they're produced, they don't live forever—they decay over time. The mean decay distance would be how far they travel on average before decaying.

The problem gives me some numbers: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance. I think this has to do with the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is calculated by the product of the particle's lifetime (τ) and its velocity (v), multiplied by the speed of light (c) to get meters. So the formula should be something like L = v * τ * c. Or wait, maybe it's just L = τ * c * beta, where beta is v/c? Yeah, that sounds right because beta is v/c, so v is beta c, so L would be tau * beta c.

But wait, tau is the mean lifetime, right. And I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Or wait, isn't Γ the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime. Let me think: I think Γ is equal to ħ divided by the lifetime, so Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, so to get tau, I take ħ divided by Γ. Once I have tau, I multiply by beta c to get the mean decay length.

But wait, beta is v/c. To find beta, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The particle has energy E and mass m, so E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Solving for p, we get p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) / c.

Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So let me compute that. Let me convert everything into appropriate units. Let me think in terms of units where c=1, but then I have to remember to convert back. Or perhaps I should use natural units and then convert to meters.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute beta as (pc/E), because in relativity, beta = v/c = (pc)/(E) since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v. So beta = (p c) / E.

So let me compute p. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So p² c² = E² - (m c²)^2. Let me compute E² in GeV²: 8^2 =64. (m c^2)^2 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV². So p² c² = 64 -1.44 = 62.56 GeV². So p c = sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me calculate that: sqrt(62.56) is... let's see, because 8^2 is 64, so sqrt(62.56) is a bit less than 8. Let me compute 7.91^2: 7.91 *7.91 = approximately 62.56? Let me check:

7.9 *7.9=62.41, 7.91^2= (7.9 +0.01)^2 = 62.41 + 2*7.9*0.01 + 0.0001 = 62.41 +0.158 +0.0001≈62.5681. Oh, that's very close to 62.56. So p c ≈7.91 GeV. So p c is about 7.91 GeV, which is 7.91 GeV.

So beta is p c / E. That would be 7.91 /8 ≈0.98875. So beta is about 0.98875, which is quite high, meaning the meson is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Now, what about the lifetime tau? As I thought, tau is ħ / Γ. But the units here are important. Because ħ is in J·s, and Γ is given in MeV. So I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Let me recall the constants. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So converting ħ into GeV·s: ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Because I remember that ħc is about 197.3 MeV·fm, but that's another conversion factor.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. But I need to convert that into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is equal to 6.582/0.32 * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So tau is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = beta * c * tau. Let's compute each part.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So beta is approximately 0.98875.

So beta c is 0.98875 *3e8 m/s ≈2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply that by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

L ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiplying the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.056875 = let's compute this.

2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 * 0.056875 = approximately 0.169 (since 2.96625 * 0.05 is 0.1483125, and 0.006875 is about 0.020547, so total 0.16886).

So total is approximately 5.9325 + 0.16886 ≈6.10136.

So 6.10136e(8-24) = 6.10136e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. That gives me about 6.1e-16 meters, but none of the options are near that. Let me double-check my calculations because the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, beta c is approximately 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s. So 0.98875 *3e8= 2.96625e8 m/s. Hmm, that's correct.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 *2.056875) *1e(8-24) = 6.10136 *1e-16. So that's 6.10136e-16 meters.

But looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 *1e-16 m

B) 4.0655 *1e-15 m

C) 5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, so my calculation is 6.1e-16 meters. None of the options match that. That suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me check that again.

Wait, beta is (pc)/(E). So p c is sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV, and E is 8 GeV. So 7.91/8 = approximately 0.98875, which is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me recheck that.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / gamma. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the width Γ is in MeV, not GeV. Oh wait, no, I converted 320 MeV to 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the natural units where c=1 and then convert at the end. Wait, let me think about that approach.

In natural units (GeV, GeV/c, etc.), the speed is v = pc / E. So beta is (p c ) / (E ), which we have as 7.91 GeV / 8 GeV = 0.98875, same as before.

Then the lifetime tau is ħ / Gamma. But in natural units, ħ c has units of GeV·fm. Wait, perhaps I should use the expression for the decay length in natural units and then convert to meters.

Wait, another approach: The decay length L is given by L = (gamma * beta * c * tau) * (something). Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean lifetime and beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length considering the relativistic factors. Let me think about the formula for the decay length.

The decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, because gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = E/(m c²). Hmm, in natural units, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², then gamma is E/(m c²) * c^2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, gamma is E/(m c²). Since in natural units, c=1, gamma is E/(m). So here, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma =8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667.

Wait, earlier calculation for beta was 0.98875. So gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 - (7.91/8)^2) → let me compute 7.91^2 is 62.5681, 8^2 is 64. So 1 - 62.5681/64 = (64 -62.5681)/64 =1.4319/64 ≈0.02237. So sqrt(0.02237) ≈0.1496. So gamma is 1/(0.1496)≈6.683. Hmm, close to 6.6667. So that's correct.

Wait, so perhaps the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but earlier I thought L is beta * c * tau, but now I'm thinking it's gamma times that. Which is correct?

Wait, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau), so tau_lab = gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (since the lifetime is longer in the lab frame due to time dilation). But wait, I'm getting confused. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, so the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the mean lifetime is gamma times tau (tau being the proper lifetime, which is in the rest frame). So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but then the decay length is L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, because the velocity is v, and the lifetime is gamma tau.

So L = v * gamma tau.

Alternatively, that can be written as L = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, because v = beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

But from the uncertainty principle, tau is ħ / Gamma. So putting it all together:

L = (gamma beta c) (ħ / Gamma).

Hmm, but let me think about the units. Gamma is in GeV, so when I compute ħ / Gamma, I get s, because ħ has units GeV s.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the formula L = (gamma * beta * c) * (hbar / Gamma).

So let's compute this.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So hbar / Gamma is (6.582e-25) / (0.32) = 2.056875e-24 seconds, same as before.

Gamma times beta is 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈6.6667 *0.98875.

Let me compute that: 6.6667 *0.98875.

Approximately 6.6667 * (1 - 0.01125) = 6.6667 - (6.6667 * 0.01125).

0.01125 times 6.6667 is about 0.075. So 6.6667 -0.075=6.5917.

So gamma * beta is approximately 6.5917.

Then, c is 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together:

L = gamma * beta * c * (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, no, L = (gamma * beta * c) * (hbar / Gamma).

So let's compute:

gamma beta c = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s ≈1.9775e9 m/s.

Then, hbar / Gamma is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 1.9775e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1.9775e9 and 2.056875e-24:

1.9775 * 2.056875 ≈4.0655.

And 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

So L≈4.0655e-15 meters.

Wait, that's option B: 4.0655 *1e-15 m. But wait, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, yes.

Wait, but earlier when I didn't include gamma, I got about 6e-16 m, which isn't an option. Now when I include gamma, I get about 4.06e-15, which is option B.

But wait, the initial approach I took didn't include gamma. So that's where I went wrong.

So the correct approach is to calculate L = gamma * beta * c * (hbar / Gamma).

Let me make that precise.

Gamma (Lorentz factor) = E/(m c²) → since E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c², so E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

Beta is pc/E → pc is sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV. So beta = 7.91 /8 ≈0.98875.

Gamma * beta = (8/1.2) * (7.91/8) = (7.91)/(1.2) ≈6.5917.

c = 3e8 m/s.

hbar =6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma width is 0.32 GeV.

So hbar / Gamma =6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (gamma beta c) * (hbar / Gamma) → (6.5917 *3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculate 6.5917 *3e8 =1.9775e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 *2.056875) *1e-15.

1.9775 *2.056875 ≈4.0655.

So L≈4.0655e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but wait. Another approach I thought earlier was L = beta * c * tau, which gave me 6e-16, but that was without considering gamma. So that was incorrect because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the correct approach uses gamma.

So the correct answer should be option B. But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

So option B is 4.0655e-15, which matches our calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Here, \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \frac{pc}{E}
\]

where \( p \) is the momentum. Using the energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \), we solve for \( pc \):

\[
(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \, \text{GeV}^2
\]

\[
pc = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{pc}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \gamma \beta \approx 6.6667 \times 0.98875 \approx 6.5917 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = (6.5917 \times 3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

\[
L \approx (1.9775 \times 10^9) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
