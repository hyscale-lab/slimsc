Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unknown white solid and wants to identify it using spectral data. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at the Mass Spec data: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's a peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, I remember that molecular ions can sometimes lose a fragment, which might create other peaks. The molecular weight here is 156. But wait, the next peak is 158. That's 2 units higher. Oh, maybe there's a chlorine involved because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35, but wait, 35Cl is the main isotope. Oh wait, but if there's a Cl in the molecule, then when the molecule loses a Cl, the molecular ion would have Cl in it. Or perhaps, the molecule has Cl and another substituent. Alternatively, the m/z 158 peak could be the molecular ion plus something else. Maybe it's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% Cl-35 (mass 35) and 25% Cl-37 (mass 37). Oh wait, but the molecular ion is at 156, which is even. If there's a Cl in the molecule, the molecular ion could be 156 and 158 because of the Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes.

Wait, but let me think. If the molecular formula includes Cl, the molecular ion would typically show a pattern where every peak is +2 apart, like 156, 158, 160, etc., depending on the number of Cl atoms. But here, there's only a 158 peak at 32%. So maybe there's one Cl atom in the molecule. So the molecular ion at 156 would have Cl-35, and 158 would be Cl-37. Oh, because Cl-37 is 25% abundant, but the peak is at 32%. Hmm, maybe that's the case. Alternatively, another possibility is that the molecule could have a nitro group or something else, but I think Cl is more likely here.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. For O-H, a broad peak around 3000-3500 cm^-1 is typical for alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a carboxylic acid (which typically absorb around 1700 cm^-1) or maybe an ester or aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde's carbonyl is usually around 2800 (stretching for aldehyde's C-H) and 1720-1710 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 2500-3300 (O-H stretch) and a strong peak around 1700-1725 for the carbonyl. But wait, the IR here has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is a wide range. That might suggest an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The sharp peak at 1720 is probably a carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very downfield shift, likely an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton, which can be even more downfield, like 10-12 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so it's likely a single proton. Carboxylic acids have O-H protons which are usually broad, but in the NMR here, the peak at 11.0 is a singlet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because O-H in carboxylic acids are usually broad singlets, but sometimes they can be sharp if the sample is dry and the exchange is slow. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So 11.0 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but phenols are usually less downfield, around 5-7 ppm, unless it's strongly deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent, like a ketone? But that wouldn't explain the H at 11.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's another peak at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That sounds like two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, perhaps with two substituents. So, the aromatic protons are in a para arrangement. Let me think: in para-substituted benzene, each pair of protons (ortho and meta) would have different shifts. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted ring in the para position.

So putting this together: the NMR shows a single proton at 11 ppm, which is likely a carbonyl group, but let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl in position 3, OH in position 2, and aldehyde in position 1. Wait, benzaldehyde with substituents. So the substituents would be in positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and the aldehyde is in position 1, making it 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But wait, that would be a tri-substituted benzene. The NMR would have more than two sets of protons, unless the substitution is symmetrical. Hmm, maybe not.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1. So the ring would have substituents in positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But in para substitution, the protons would be ortho and meta. Let me think about the NMR. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The H's adjacent to COOH (position 2 and 6) would be deshielded and possibly appear as a doublet, and the H's next to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be another doublet. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and para to Cl. The H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Each pair would be equivalent. So in the NMR, you'd see two doublets: one around 8.0 ppm (for the H's next to COOH, which are more deshielded) and another at a lower field maybe around 7.5-7.8 ppm. That fits with the NMR data given: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Also, the singlet at 11 ppm would correspond to the COOH proton, which is usually a broad peak but here is a singlet. But wait, carboxylic acids' O-H protons are usually broad, but maybe in this case, it's a sharp singlet because the sample might be dried or something.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is ClCO-O-Ph. So it's an ester, where the carbonyl is adjacent to an O-Ph group. But wait, phenyl chloroformate would have a structure like Cl-CO-O-Ph. Then, the NMR might not have a singlet at 11 ppm. Alternatively, the carbonyl would be from the chloroformate. The IR would show a strong peak for the carbonyl, which it does. But the O-H in the chloroformate would be part of an ester group. Wait, chloroformate is O-Cl-CO-O-? No, wait, chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-R, where R is phenyl. So the O in the ester wouldn't be an O-H. So the IR's broad peak might not be from an O-H, unless there's another group. Alternatively, maybe the IR's broad peak is from an alcohol. But in phenyl chloroformate, I don't think there's an O-H group. So the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 might not fit. So maybe this is less likely.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the substituents are at 1 and 2. The NMR would show the aromatic protons. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho and para positions would have different shifts. But wait, in this case, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 2. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Position 4 would be para to COOH and meta to Cl. Position 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. Maybe the splitting would be different. Let me think about the substitution pattern. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent (adjacent to Cl and COOH), and positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent as well. So the NMR would show two doublets: perhaps one around 8.0 ppm and another around 7.7 ppm, which matches the data. Also, the singlet at 11 would be the COOH proton.

Hmm, but wait, the molecular weight. Let me calculate the molecular weights for each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5 g/mol. But the molecular ion is at 156. So that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is 156, and the Cl is causing the isotopic peaks.

Wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is 12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156 (probably the M+ peak, and the 158 would be the Cl-37 isotope, which is 25% abundant. So 32% is close to that. So that makes sense.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is same as B: C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight, same reasoning.

So both B and D would have same molecular weight.

Now, looking back at the NMR.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH (position 1). Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl (position 4). Wait, no, the substituents are position 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 4. So the H's are in 2,3,5,6.

In para substitution, the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be more deshielded. The H's at 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be less deshielded. So in the NMR, the H's at 2 and 6 would couple with each other and perhaps with H's at 3 and 5, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the ortho and para positions would have different shifts.

Wait, let me think about the coupling. In a para-substituted benzene, each H is adjacent to substituents in a way that creates equivalent pairs. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. Same with positions 3 and 5. So each pair would be a doublet. The H at 2 would be next to COOH and adjacent to H at position 3. Similarly, H at 6 would be next to COOH and H at position 5. Wait, perhaps each H is adjacent to two others, leading to a doublet of doublets. But in the NMR data, it's given as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's at 2 and 6 are a doublet (each seeing H's at 3 and 5?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the coupling is between ortho and para positions.

Wait, maybe I should think of the para-substituted benzene as having two sets of equivalent H's. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's in positions 2 and 6 are each ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H's in positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. So in the NMR, the H's at 2 and 6 would be more deshielded and appear as a doublet around 8.0 ppm. The H's at 3 and 5 would be less deshielded and appear around 7.72 ppm, as a doublet. That matches the NMR data given: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Also, the singlet at 11 ppm would be the COOH proton, which is a broad peak, but perhaps in this case, it's a sharp peak because it's been dried or because the solution is concentrated.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So substituents are adjacent. So the ring would have H's at positions 3,4,5,6. Let's see: H at 3 is ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. H at 4 is para to Cl and meta to COOH. H at 5 is ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. H at 6 is ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Wait, but substituents are at 1 and 2, so the H's at 3 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, while H's at 4 and 5 would be adjacent to COOH? Or wait, position 3 is next to Cl at 2, and position 6 is next to COOH at 1. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, the H's in 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have different coupling patterns. I think the aromatic protons would be split into more complex patterns than two doublets. But in the NMR data, it's two doublets. So perhaps 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) is more likely because the symmetry gives two sets of equivalent H's, leading to two doublets.

So let's recap:

- Mass Spec: M+ at 156, with 158 as Cl isotope. So molecular formula includes Cl and O.

- IR: Broad peak suggests OH (carboxylic acid or alcohol), strong peak at 1720 suggests carbonyl (likely carboxylic acid or ester). The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which is a strong downfield shift, likely a COOH proton.

- The aromatic protons in NMR are two doublets, indicating a para-substituted structure with two substituents, likely Cl and COOH in para positions (option B).

So the correct answer should be option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Mass Spectrometry (MS)
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: Indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156.
- **Peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: This is consistent with the presence of a chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes: Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%). The relative abundance of 32% aligns with Cl-37.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

### Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR)
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A sharp singlet at this downfield shift is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. The splitting pattern and chemical shifts are consistent with a benzene ring substituted with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
   - This structure has an aldehyde group, which would produce a proton signal around 9-10 ppm, not 11.0 ppm. Additionally, the aromatic splitting pattern does not match the given NMR data. **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - The structure features a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4 on the benzene ring. This creates a para-substituted aromatic system, which matches the NMR data:
     - The two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons in positions 2/6 and 3/5, respectively.
     - The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton.
   - The molecular weight (156 g/mol) and the MS data (m/z = 156 and 158) are consistent with this structure. **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**
   - This compound lacks an O-H group, so it cannot produce the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not support this structure. **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This structure has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 2. The resulting aromatic splitting pattern would not produce two simple doublets, as the substituents are ortho to each other, leading to more complex coupling. **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion
The spectral data is most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight, MS isotopic pattern, IR absorption for O-H and carbonyl groups, and the NMR splitting pattern all support this structure.

**Answer: B**
