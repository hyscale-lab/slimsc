Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. Hmm, binary compounds usually mean two elements, so fluorine and Y combined in different ratios.

The question is a bit tricky, but let's break it down. There are five compounds, labeled A1 to A5. The problem gives some properties of each. I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Starting with A1: it decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, oxidizing xenon—that suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but if A1 can make it react, A1 must be something really reactive.

A decomposition reaction: A1 → A2 + F2. So A1 must be a compound that breaks down into something else and fluorine. Since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, F2 is the usual form.

I remember that when a compound decomposes into F2, it's often because the original compound has fluorine in a lower oxidation state. For example, if A1 is something like YF3, and it decomposes into YF4 and F2? Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF2 or another stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: The decomposition produces fluorine, so the fluorine in A1 must be in a lower oxidation state than in the products. So when A1 decomposes, the fluorine's oxidation state increases, meaning A1 is perhaps a lower oxide, like YF2, which decomposes into YF3 and F2? Or maybe YF3 to YF4 and F2? I'm not sure yet.

But let's think about the oxidation of xenon. Xenon can form compounds, like XeO3 or XeF4. If A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe it's XeF4 or something else, but wait, A1 is a binary compound of fluorine and Y, so Y is the other element. So if Y is something that combines with F to form a compound that can oxidize Xe, which is a noble gas. What elements can do that?

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen isn't a noble gas. Alternatively, maybe Y is fluorine itself? No, because it's a binary compound, so two elements. Wait, the compounds are between Y and fluorine, so Y is another element besides F.

Wait, another angle: Xenon's oxidation. Xenon can be oxidized by a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but so are other compounds. For example, XeO3 is a strong oxidizing agent. But in this case, A1 is a binary compound of Y and F.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. So A1 could be something like XeF2 or another Xe fluoride. But then Y would be Xe, but wait, the problem says five binary compounds of fluorine with Y. So Y has to form five different binary fluorides. Which elements have multiple binary fluorides?

Hmm, let's think about elements with multiple fluorides. For example, oxygen has OF2 and O2F2, but that's more exotic. Alternatively, elements like sulfur have multiple fluorides, but I'm not sure about five. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the noble gas xenon can form several fluorides. Xenon has compounds like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. But that's only three. Wait, but the problem states five binary compounds, so perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine? Chlorine can form several fluorides? No, I don't think so. Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? No, oxygen's fluorides are limited.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the decomposition of A1. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So A1 → A2 + F2.

Assuming A2 is another fluoride of Y. Let's say A1 is YF3. Then perhaps YF3 → YF2 + F2? No, that doesn't make sense because fluorine's oxidation state would be lower.

Wait, perhaps A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. But the problem says that A2 has an oF (oxidation state of F) of 31.96%. Wait, what's that percentage? Oh, wait, oF usually refers to the oxidation state. So 31.96%—maybe that's the percentage of fluorine's oxidation state. Wait, maybe it's the average oxidation state.

Wait, the oxidation state of F is positive or negative? Fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state. Wait, but sometimes in higher oxidation states, like in some compounds, maybe fluorine can be in a higher state. Wait, no, in most compounds, F is -1.

Wait, the problem says that in A2, the oxidation state of F is 31.96%. Hmm, perhaps that's the average oxidation state when there are multiple F atoms with different states. Wait, 31.96%—wait, maybe that's the percentage of fluorine in the compound by mass. Because 31.96 is close to the atomic weight of fluorine (about 19 for F). Wait, no, wait: fluorine has an atomic weight of ~19, so 31.96% would be roughly 1.7 times that. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the oxidation state is given as a percentage. Wait, the oxidation state of F in A2 is 31.96%. So if each F has a certain oxidation state, maybe the average is 31.96%.

Wait, but fluorine usually has -1. Let me think: if F has an oxidation state of +1, that would be unusual. Alternatively, maybe the way the question is phrased is that the oF is 31.96%, which might be the percentage of fluorine by mass in the compound. So perhaps A2 has a certain molecular formula where F is 31.96% by mass.

So, let's consider A2 as YF_x. The mass percent of F is (19*x) / (atomic weight of Y + 19x) ) *100 = 31.96%.

So 19x / (Y + 19x) = 0.3196.

Let me rearrange:

19x = 0.3196(Y + 19x)

19x = 0.3196 Y + 6.1 (approx, since 0.3196 *19x is 6.1 x?)

Wait, maybe better to do exact math.

19x = 0.3196*(Y + 19x)

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

190000x = 3196(Y + 19x)

Expanding right side: 3196 Y + 3196*19 x.

Calculate 3196 *19: Let's compute 3000*19=57,000; 196*19=3,724. So total is 57,000 + 3,724 = 60,724.

So 190,000x = 3196 Y + 60,724 x.

Bring terms with x to left:

190,000x -60,724x = 3196 Y

129,276 x = 3196 Y

Divide both sides by 4 (to simplify):

32,319 x = 799 Y

Wait, 129,276 /4 is 32,319 and 3196/4 is 799.

So 32,319 x = 799 Y.

Hmm, that's a big equation. Let's see if Y is a known element. Let's think about possible Y values.

Wait, perhaps Y is an element with a common fluoride. Let's assume Y is Cl. Chlorine's atomic weight is about 35.5.

So plugging Y=35.5:

32,319 x = 799 *35.5

799 *35.5: 799*35=27,965; 799*0.5=399.5 → total 28,364.5.

So 32,319 x = 28,364.5 → x ≈ 28,364.5 /32,319 ≈ 0.878. Hmm, x is about 0.88, which isn't possible because x should be an integer. So Cl doesn't fit.

Next, maybe Y is Br. Bromine is about 80 g/mol.

So 32,319 x = 799 *80 = 63,920.

x=63,920 /32,319 ≈ 1.977. Close to 2. So x≈2.

So Y=Br, x=2.

So A2 would be YF2, which is BrF2. Wait, but does bromine form BrF2? I thought bromine's common fluorides are BrF3 and BrF5. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Y is iodine. I is about 127 g/mol.

So 32,319 x =799 *127 = approx 799*100=79,900; 799*27=21,573 → total 101,473.

x=101,473 /32,319 ≈ 3.14. So x≈3. So A2 would be IF3. Does I form IF3? I think I forms IF5 and IF7, but not IF3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen. O is 16 g/mol.

So 32,319 x=799 *16=12,784.

x=12,784 /32,319 ≈ 0.395. Not possible.

Hmm, maybe Y is something else. Let's think. Let's try Y= S, atomic weight ~32.

32,319 x =799 *32=25,568 → x=25,568 /32,319 ≈ 0.791. No, not integer.

Hmm, another approach. Let me make x an integer and see if Y comes out as a plausible element.

From 32,319 x = 799 Y → Y= (32,319 x)/(799)

We can compute Y for integer x and see if it's close to any element's atomic weight.

Let me compute Y for x=1:

Y=32319 /799 ≈40.47. Closest is Zr (≈91?), no. Maybe Y is around 40.47, but that's not a common element. Wait, 40 is Zr? No, Zr is about 91. Oh wait, maybe it's titanium? Titanium is about 48. Close, but not exact.

x=2: Y= (32,319*2)/799 ≈64,638 /799≈81. Hmm, 81 is close to bromine (Br is ~80). So Y≈81. So for x=2, Y≈81, which is Br. So Y would be Br, with x=2, making A2=BrF2.

But earlier I thought BrF2 isn't a known compound. Let me think again. Wait, does BrF2 exist? I'm not sure, but perhaps in certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl. Wait, Cl is 35.5, but when x=2, Y=81, which is Br. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check: 32,319 x = 3196 Y → No, earlier I think I might have messed up the equation. Let me go back.

Original equation after moving terms:

190,000x = 3196 Y + 60,724 x

Subtract 60,724x from both sides:

129,276 x = 3196 Y

So Y = (129,276 x) / 3196

Let me compute 129276 /3196.

Compute 3196 *40=127,840 → 129,276-127,840=1,436.

3196 *0.45=1,438.2 → close to 1,436. So 40.45 times.

So Y ≈40.45 x.

So Y=40.45x.

We're looking for x where Y is an element's atomic weight.

x must be an integer. Let's try x=1: Y≈40.45. Close to Zr? No, Zr is about 91. Maybe it's another element. Wait, 40.45 is close to the atomic weight of titanium (Ti is about 47.867). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, x=2: Y=80.9. That's close to Br (79.9). So Y=Br.

So x=2, Y=80.9 → Br. So A2 is BrF2. But do BrF2 compounds exist? I'm not certain, but I'll proceed with this assumption.

So, A1 decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So A1 would be a higher fluoride. Maybe A1 is BrF4? Because BrF4 can decompose. Let me think about the reaction:

BrF4 → BrF2 + F2.

Wait, that would require BrF4 to have F in a higher state than BrF2. Let me check oxidation states.

In BrF4, each F is -1. So Br is +3 (since 4*(-1) + Br = 0 → Br=+4? Wait no, wait: Br in BrF4: each F is -1, so 4*(-1) + Br = 0 → Br is +4.

In BrF2: each F is -1, so Br is +2.

So the decomposition would be BrF4 → BrF2 + F2. That makes sense because Br goes from +4 to +2, and F goes from -1 to 0 (in F2).

So A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 (A2) and F2.

But wait, the problem states that A1 is a bright-red substance. Hmm, what color is BrF4? I'm not sure, but maybe it's correct for the sake of the problem.

So Y is Br. So the binary compounds are BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, BrF5, and BrF6. That's five, so that fits.

Next, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y with fluorine. So Y is Br, so A3 is BrF3? Or another fluoride.

Wait, fluorination of Y would typically involve adding F2. So Y (Br) + F2 → BrF_x. The possible products would be BrF3, BrF5, etc. But the problem says A3 is obtained by fluorination. So perhaps A3 is BrF3.

A3 can also interact with xenon. Maybe it's a reaction where Xenon is oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps A3 is a catalyst or something else. Not sure, but perhaps not critical for determining the molecular weight of A4.

Now, moving to the next part: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

So Y is Br. So adding Br to a solution of A4 (which is a fluoride of Br?) in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but A4 is a compound of Y and F. So A4 is a binary compound. When Br is added, perhaps a metathesis reaction occurs.

Wait, but the solution of A4 is hot and concentrated. Adding Br (in what form? Maybe as Br2? Or as another compound?) Wait, the problem says adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. So perhaps Y is being added as Br2 or another form.

Wait, Y is Br, so perhaps it's elemental Br. Adding Br to a solution of A4 (a BrF_x) would cause a reaction. For example, if A4 is BrF3, adding Br (elemental) might not react. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a different fluoride.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think: what reaction occurs when Br is added to a solution of a fluoride?

Wait, perhaps A4 is a higher fluoride. For example, if A4 is BrF5, adding Br (elemental) might lead to a reaction producing something else.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the solution of A4 is something like a solution of HBrF4 or another acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about A5. When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So A5 might be a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base, or maybe into two gases.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A5 is a salt like YF3. When it decomposes in water, it might form Y(OH)3 and HF. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the problem says A4 is a compound that, when Y is added in 1:1 ratio, forms A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a salt that reacts with Br to form another salt. For example, if A4 is KBrF4 ( potassium bromate tetrafluoride?), but that's probably not. Alternatively, maybe A4 is NaBrF4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF4, but when Br is added, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's move to the molecular weight part.

The question is to find the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

Assuming Y is Br (atomic weight ~80), and A4 is a binary compound of Br and F.

Possible compounds:

BrF2: 80 + 2*19= 118 → 118 g/mol.

BrF3: 80 + 3*19= 147.

BrF4: 80 +4*19= 136.

BrF5: 80 +5*19= 175.

BrF6: 80 +6*19= 206.

Wait, looking at these:

BrF2 → 118 → option D (110-130).

BrF3 →147 → option A (140-160).

BrF4 →136 → option D (110-130).

BrF5 →175 → option C (160-180).

BrF6 →206 → option B (220-240) is higher, but 206 is in option B? No, 206 is below 220, so option B starts at 220.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 140-160 → 147 is in here.

B) 220-240 → 206 is below.

C)160-180 → 175 is in here.

D)110-130 → 118 and 136 are in here.

But the question is about A4's molecular weight. So which of these is A4?

A4 is the compound before adding Y.

Wait, let me think about the reaction when Y is added to A4. Suppose A4 is BrF5. Adding Br in 1:1 ratio gives A5. What would that reaction be?

BrF5 + Br → ?

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt, like KBrF4. If you add Br, maybe it doesn't react. Or perhaps it's a double displacement reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of KBrF4 (molar mass: K is ~39, Br ~80, F4 ~76 → 39+80+76=195. So 195 is in option B (220-240? No, 195 is less than 220.) So not in the options.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is HBrF4. HBrF4 has H (~1), Br (~80), F4 (~76) → total 157. So 157 is in option C (160-180? No, 157 is below 160.)

Hmm, but I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the given data again.

When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So perhaps A5 is an acid that breaks down into two products, like a diatomic molecule and something else.

Wait, suppose A5 is HBrF4. When it decomposes in water, perhaps it breaks down into HBr and HF. But that doesn't make sense because HBrF4 is H+ BrF4^-.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a salt that is unstable in water and decomposes into two different compounds.

Alternatively, the decomposition could be into an acid and a base. For example, if A5 is CaBrF3, it might decompose into Ca(OH)F and HBr, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should focus more on A4.

Earlier, I considered that A4 could be BrF5. Its molecular weight is 175, which is in option C (160-180). Alternatively, if A4 is BrF4, molecular weight is 136, which is in option D.

But how to determine which one it is?

Well, earlier in the problem, A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So A1 is BrF4.

If A4 is a different compound, perhaps BrF5.

Wait, but how does adding Y (Br) in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution produce A5?

If A4 is BrF5, then adding Br would not make sense because BrF5 is a binary compound. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt that includes Br and F, like KBrF4.

Wait, KBrF4 is a possible compound. So when you add Br (elemental, perhaps as Br2) to a hot solution of KBrF4, what happens?

The reaction could be:

KBrF4 + Br → ?

Not sure, but perhaps it's a redox reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF4. Adding Br (elemental) might not react, but maybe in hot conditions.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is another compound, like NaBrF4. But without more info, it's hard.

But the key point is that the molecular weight of A4 has to fall into one of the options. Based on the possible compounds, BrF5 (175) is in option C (160-180). BrF4 is 136, which is in option D (110-130). But which one is A4?

Wait, the problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, which is Br. So A3 is a binary compound of Br and F. So A3 could be BrF3, BrF5, etc.

But when Y is added to A4's solution, producing A5, which decomposes into two substances. Maybe A5 is a higher fluoride, like BrF6?

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let's think about the options.

If A4 is BrF5, its molecular weight is 175, which falls into option C (160-180).

If A4 is BrF4, 136 → option D.

If A4 is BrF3, 147 → option A.

But without knowing exactly what A4 is, I need to find which option is correct.

Looking back at the problem statement, A1 is the bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2. Assuming A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2.

Now, the question is about the molecular weight of A4. Let's think about A4 in the context of the reaction: adding Y (Br) in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution produces A5, which decomposes in water.

If A4 is a higher fluoride, like BrF5, and when Br is added, it could form BrF6. BrF5 + Br → BrF6. But BrF6 is a possible compound, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF4. Adding Br might not react, but maybe in hot conditions, something happens.

Wait, another angle: when A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a salt that is unstable in water, like CaF2, but that's not right. Alternatively, it could be something like HBrO and HF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a compound that releases HF when it decomposes. For example, if A5 is CaBr2F6, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, if A5 is HBrF4, which when decomposed in water would produce HBr and HF. But that's just a guess.

But, I'm not making progress. So perhaps I should look at the possible options and see which make sense.

Assuming that A4 is BrF5, with molecular weight 175, which is in option C (160-180). So the answer would be option C.

But wait, another possibility: A4 could be a salt with a higher molecular weight. For example, if A4 is NaBrF4, its molecular weight is 39 (Na) + 80 (Br) +4*19 (F) = 39 +80 +76= 195. 195 is in option B (220-240? No, wait, 195 is less than 220, so it's not in any option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if A4 is KBrF4, then the molecular weight is 39 (K) +80 +76= 195. Same as above.

So that's not an option. So perhaps A4 is BrF5, which is 175, option C.

Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3, molecular weight 147 → option A.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about Y being Br. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: think about the fluorination of Y to get A3. If A3 is YF_x, and Y is a metal, perhaps a third-period element. For example, Cl, but Cl doesn't form five binary fluorides. Wait, but I thought Br does.

Wait, another thought: what if Y is chlorine? No, because Cl doesn't form five binary fluorides. Wait, Cl has ClF3, ClF5, but not others. So that's only two or three. So Br is more likely.

So I'm confident Y is Br. So A4's molecular weight is either 136 (BrF4, option D) or 175 (BrF5, option C).

But the problem says A4 is a compound that when Y is added, forms A5. So if A4 is BrF5, adding Br might produce BrF6, which has a higher molecular weight. But BrF6's molecular weight is 80 +6*19= 80+114=194. So 194 is in option B's range (220-240? No, 194 is lower than 220.) So not in option B.

Alternatively, maybe when Br is added to BrF5, it doesn't change, but perhaps another reaction occurs. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is BrF4. Adding Br to BrF4 could produce BrF3 and Br2? Not sure.

But I'm stuck again. Let me think about the options and which is more plausible.

If A4 is BrF5 (175), then the answer is option C (160-180). If A4 is BrF4 (136), the answer is option D.

But how to decide between them.

Looking back, when A1 is BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So A2 is BrF2.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Br) with F2, which would give higher fluorides, like BrF3, BrF5, etc.

Now, A4 is another compound. If A4 is BrF3, its molecular weight is 147 → option A.

But when Y is added (Br) to A4's solution, which is BrF3, perhaps nothing happens, but in hot conditions, maybe a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a higher fluoride, like BrF5.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Since the options include 160-180 (C), which includes 175, and 110-130 (D), which includes 136.

But considering that A4 is a compound that when Br is added, forms another compound, perhaps A4 is BrF5. So molecular weight 175. So the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of compound A4, a binary fluoride of element Y, based on the given reactions and properties. Here's the analysis:

1. **Compound A1**: A1 is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with fluorine's oxidation state contributing 31.96%) and fluorine. Additionally, A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent. Based on this, A1 is identified as BrF4, which decomposes into BrF2 (A2) and F2. This places Y as bromine (Br), as bromine forms five binary fluorides (BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, BrF5, BrF6), satisfying the condition of five binary compounds.

2. **Compound A2**: From the decomposition reaction, A2 is identified as BrF2. The oxidation state of fluorine in BrF2 is consistent with the given data.

3. **Compound A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Br) with fluorine. This suggests A3 is a higher fluoride, such as BrF3, BrF5, or BrF6. However, the exact identity of A3 is not critical for determining the molecular weight of A4.

4. **Compound A4**: A4 is a binary fluoride of bromine. When bromine (Y) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Based on the possible fluorides of bromine, A4 could be BrF4 or BrF5. 

   - If A4 is BrF4, its molecular weight is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of BrF4} = 80 + 4 \times 19 = 136 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]
     This falls within the range 110–130 (Option D).

   - If A4 is BrF5, its molecular weight is:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of BrF5} = 80 + 5 \times 19 = 175 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]
     This falls within the range 160–180 (Option C).

5. **Final Determination**: The problem does not explicitly identify A4, but based on the context and the decomposition reaction, BrF5 is a more plausible candidate for A4. This is because BrF5 is a common compound that could undergo further reactions with bromine under hot, concentrated conditions to form A5, which subsequently decomposes in water.

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 is most consistent with BrF5, placing it in the range 160–180.

**Answer: C**
