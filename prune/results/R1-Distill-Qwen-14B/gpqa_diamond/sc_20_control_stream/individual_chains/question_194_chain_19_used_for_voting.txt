Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me the energy as E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each spin can be +1 or -1. And I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Oh right, but since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the three spins.

I remember that the partition function Z is the sum of e^{-βE} for each possible state. So I need to compute E for each of the 8 states and then sum up the exponentials.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because that could take a while. Let's think about the structure of the energy. The energy is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So for each state, I can compute the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, and then E is -J * S.

So, the exponent becomes -βE = β J S. So each term in the partition function is e^{β J S}.

Hmm, I need to find all possible values of S for the three spins and count how many states give each S. Then multiply the count by e^{β J S} and sum them all.

Let me think about the possible values of S. For three spins, each product S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So each term in the sum S = a + b + c, where a, b, c are each ±1. Wait, but that's for each pair in the three spins.

Wait, for three spins, the pairs are S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. So for each state, I have three terms, each being either +1 or -1. So the sum S can range from -3 to +3, in steps of 2? Or maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, each term is ±1, so the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Let me think:

Case 1: all three products are +1. Then S=3.

Case 2: two products are +1, one is -1. Then S=1.

Case 3: two products are -1, one is +1. Then S= -1.

Case 4: all three products are -1. Then S= -3.

So S can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Now, how many states correspond to each S?

Let me think about each case.

Case 1: S=3. All three products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1.

That would mean that all the pairs have the same spin. So S1 = S2 = S3. Because S1S2=+1 implies S1=S2. Similarly, S1S3=+1 implies S1=S3. Hence, S1=S2=S3. So there are two such states: all +1, or all -1. Wait no, wait: all +1 would give S1S2=+1, etc., but all -1 would also give each product as +1 because (-1)(-1)=1. So S=3 occurs for two states.

Wait, each state has three spins, all the same. So yes, two states: (++, +), (---, etc.)

Wait, for three spins, all up: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, etc. So S=3. Similarly, all down: S1=S2=S3=-1. Then each product is 1. So S=3 again.

So S=3 occurs in two states.

Case 2: S=1. Two products are +1, one is -1.

So how many states have S=1?

Hmm. Let me think of the possible combinations. For the sum S=1, two terms are +1, one is -1. So for the three terms, two are +1 and one is -1.

But how does that affect the spins?

Each product term is S_i S_j. So for the three pairs, two are +1 and one is -1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the spin states. Let's think about the spin configurations and calculate S for each.

The three spins can be in any combination of +1 and -1. Let's list all possible 8 states and compute S for each.

But that might take too long, but perhaps for this problem, it's manageable.

All possible spin states:

1. (+1, +1, +1): S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → S=3.

2. (+1, +1, -1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → S= 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

3. (+1, -1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 → S= -1 +1 + (-1) = -1.

4. (+1, -1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → S= -1 + (-1) +1= -1.

5. (-1, +1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → S= -1 + (-1) +1= -1.

6. (-1, +1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 → S= -1 +1 + (-1)= -1.

7. (-1, -1, +1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → S=1 + (-1) + (-1)= -1.

8. (-1, -1, -1): All products are 1 → S=3.

Wait, that's interesting. So in the 8 states, S=3 occurs twice (states 1 and 8), and S=-1 occurs six times (states 2,3,4,5,6,7). Wait, but what about S=1 and S=-3? Did I miss any?

Wait, no. Because in all the computed S values for the 8 states, S is either 3 or -1. So where are the cases where S=1 or S=-3?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each state.

Wait, state 2: (+1, +1, -1):

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So S=1 -1 -1 = -1.

State 3: (+1, -1, +1):

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. So S=-1 +1 -1= -1.

State 4: (+1, -1, -1):

S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. So S= -1 -1 +1= -1.

State 5: (-1, +1, +1):

S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. S= -1 -1 +1= -1.

State 6: (-1, +1, -1):

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. S= -1 +1 -1= -1.

State 7: (-1, -1, +1):

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So S=1 -1 -1= -1.

So in all 8 states, S is either 3 (two states) or -1 (six states). Wait, so where's S=1 and S=-3?

Ah, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the possible S values. Let me think again.

Wait, what if S can only take even or odd numbers? Let me compute all possible sums.

Each term in S is ±1, and there are three terms. So the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3. Because 3 terms, each ±1.

So, for 3 terms: all +1 → sum 3.

Two +1, one -1: sum is +1.

One +1, two -1: sum is -1.

All -1: sum -3.

So why in my earlier enumeration, I didn't get any S=1 or S=-3?

Wait, maybe because that's not possible for three spins arranged in a triangle. Hmm, perhaps in this system, the sum can only be 3 or -1. Because the spins are in a triplet.

Wait, but why? Let me think of another approach. Each spin is either +1 or -1. Let's consider the three spins. Let me denote S1, S2, S3 as ±1.

The sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, perhaps we can express S in terms of the total spin or something else.

Alternatively, maybe we can represent the spins as variables and find the sum S.

But perhaps another approach is to think about the number of +1 and -1 in the products. Let me think about all possible values of S.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assessment of the possible S values. Let me try to compute S for each possible spin state again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error when evaluating some of the states.

Wait, for state 2: (+1, +1, -1)

S1S2 is (1)(1)=1.

S1S3 is (1)(-1) = -1.

S2S3 is (1)(-1)= -1.

So S=1-1-1 = -1.

Wait, correct.

State 3: (+1, -1, +1)

S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1.

S1S3= (1)(1)=1.

S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

So S= -1 +1 -1= -1.

State4: (+1, -1, -1)

S1S2= (1)(-1)=-1.

S1S3= (1)(-1)=-1.

S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

So S= -1 -1 +1= -1.

State5: (-1, +1, +1)

S1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.

S1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.

S2S3= (+1)(+1)=1.

So S= -1 -1 +1= -1.

State6: (-1, +1, -1)

S1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.

S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3= (+1)(-1)=-1.

So S= -1 +1 -1= -1.

State7: (-1, -1, +1)

S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1.

S1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.

S2S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.

So S=1 -1 -1= -1.

Wait, so in all the 8 states, S is either 3 (two states: 1 and 8) or -1 (six states: 2-7). Wait, but earlier I thought S could be 1 or -3, but in reality, for three spins arranged in a triangle (all pairs), perhaps those sums are not possible.

So that changes things. So the possible S values are only 3 and -1.

So when calculating the partition function Z, I only have two terms: one for S=3 with multiplicity 2, and another for S=-1 with multiplicity 6.

So Z = 2 * e^{β J * 3} + 6 * e^{β J * (-1)}.

Wait, because for each state, the energy E is -J S. So β E is -β J S, but in the partition function, each term is exp(-β E) = exp( β J S).

So for S=3: each such state contributes e^{3 β J}, and there are two such states → 2 e^{3 β J}.

For S=-1: each such state contributes e^{- β J}, and there are six such states → 6 e^{- β J}.

So Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{- β J}.

Looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the exponents.

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J S.

So each term in the partition function is e^{-β E} = e^{ β J S}.

So yes, for S=3, it's e^{3 β J}, and for S=-1, it's e^{-β J}.

So Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ} → No, because exponents are opposite.

Option B: 2e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → Yes.

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ}+6e^{-2Jβ} → No, exponents are 2.

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ}+2e^{-2Jβ} → No.

So the correct answer is option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right),
\]

and the partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \). Since there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin states, we enumerate all possible values of \( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) and count the number of states corresponding to each \( S \).

### Step 1: Possible values of \( S \)
Each term \( S_1S_2, S_1S_3, S_2S_3 \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so the sum \( S \) can take the following values:
- \( S = 3 \): All three terms are \( +1 \).
- \( S = -1 \): Two terms are \( -1 \), and one term is \( +1 \).
- \( S = -3 \): All three terms are \( -1 \).
- \( S = 1 \): Two terms are \( +1 \), and one term is \( -1 \).

### Step 2: Counting states for each \( S \)
By enumerating all 8 spin states, we find:
- \( S = 3 \): Occurs for 2 states (all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \)).
- \( S = -1 \): Occurs for 6 states.
- \( S = 1 \) and \( S = -3 \): Do not occur for any spin state in this system.

Thus, the possible values of \( S \) are \( 3 \) and \( -1 \), with multiplicities 2 and 6, respectively.

### Step 3: Partition function
The energy \( E \) is related to \( S \) by \( E = -J S \). Substituting into the partition function:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E} = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{\beta J S}.
\]

For \( S = 3 \), each of the 2 states contributes \( e^{3\beta J} \), giving \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).  
For \( S = -1 \), each of the 6 states contributes \( e^{-\beta J} \), giving \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are \( 2\beta J \) instead of \( 3\beta J \) and \( \beta J \).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}}
\]
