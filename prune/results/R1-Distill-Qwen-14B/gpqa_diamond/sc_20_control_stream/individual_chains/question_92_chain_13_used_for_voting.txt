Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy of formation calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me see if I can visualize the structure first. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds, maybe? Because I see two C=CH groups and two C(CH3)2 at the ends. Wait, no, actually, let me count the double bonds. Each "C=" would be a double bond, so I think there are two double bonds in this molecule.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So let's break it down. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, then a CH2-, then a CH(CH3)-, another CH2-, then CH=C(CH3)2. So the molecule is probably something like a chain with substituents and two double bonds. Maybe it's a diene or something more complex.

The problem gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. The bond energies are: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. I remember that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is calculated using the bond energies. The formula involves the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products or something like that.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, that would be from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas. But the problem gives me bond energies, so perhaps I need to calculate it using bond dissociation energies (or bond energies) instead.

The general formula I remember is: ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds] divided by something? Wait, no, the other way around. Wait, no, maybe it's the sum of all the bond energies in the reactants minus the sum in the products. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of the bonds broken minus the sum of bonds formed.

Wait, no. The enthalpy change when forming the molecule from its elements would be the sum of the energies of the bonds broken (in the reactants) minus the sum of the energies of the bonds formed (in the products). So, for the formation reaction:

Elements (C and H) → Compound.

So, in this reaction, the bonds in the compound are formed, which requires energy to break the bonds in the reactants.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as the enthalpy of formation being calculated using the bond energies of the compound. The formula is usually written as:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds)] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds)]

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing this up. Another approach: The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So, each carbon atom in the compound comes from graphite (C), and each hydrogen comes from H2 gas.

The process involves breaking bonds in the reactants (C and H2) and forming bonds in the product (the compound).

The bond energies provided can be used to calculate the total energy change. 

So the steps would be:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bond in the compound.
2. Multiply each bond count by its bond energy.
3. Sum all the bond energies for the product (the compound) → this is the energy of bonds formed.
4. Subtract the sum of bond energies for the reactants (the elements) → but wait, the reactants are C and H2, so their bonds are being broken.

Wait, no. To make the compound, we start with C and H2. So we need to break the C-C bonds (if any) in graphite and the H-H bonds in H2. But wait, graphite is an extended lattice of C atoms with each C bonded to three others. So each C in graphite is part of multiple C-C bonds, but when we form the compound, each C comes from breaking those C-C bonds in graphite. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the compound) - (sum of bond energies of C and H in their standard states)

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Ah, yes! The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C)] + [Σ (number of H atoms × bond energy of H-H / 2)] - [Σ (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule)]

Wait, why divided by 2? Because each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so for each H atom in the compound, we're breaking half an H-H bond.

Let me make sure. Suppose the compound has n H atoms. Each H comes from H2, so each H requires breaking a bond. So total H-H bonds broken would be (n/2), each contributing 100 kJ/mol. So the total energy for H is (n/2) * 100.

Similarly, for each C atom, it's coming from graphite. But the enthalpy of atomization of C is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom contributes 1000 kJ/mol to the enthalpy of formation. So for m C atoms, it's m × 1000.

Then, the total energy from the reactants is (m × 1000) + (n/2 × 100). The bonds in the product (the compound) are formed, so the bond energies of the compound are subtracted because bond formation releases energy (it's exothermic). So the formula becomes:

ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2) × 100] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the compound)]

So, the problem is to calculate this.

Now, I need to find m (number of C atoms) and n (number of H atoms) in the given compound.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups, each contributing 3 H. So (CH3)2 contributes 6 H, and the C is connected to two CH3, one CH, and the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H in the entire molecule.

Let me parse the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Breaking it down into each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : This is a propene-like group. The (CH3)2C=CH- part: each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 H. The central C is connected to two CH3, a double bond CH, and a single bond to the next CH2. So in this part, C count is 4 (2 from CH3, one from C, one from CH). Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH- is actually three carbons: two CH3 attached to a C which is double-bonded to CH-. So that's 3 C's and 7 H's (each CH3:3×2=6 H, plus the CH has one H, and the double bond C has another H. Wait no, the structure is (CH3)2-C=CH-. So the C=C is between the two C's. So the first C is (CH3)2-C, the second is double-bonded to CH-.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to count all the carbons and hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be simplified. Let me write the formula in a more straightforward way.

Wait, maybe I should better consider the molecular formula of the compound to find m and n.

The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me expand each group:

Each "(CH3)2C" is C(CH3)2.

Each "CH=C(CH3)2" is C(CH3)2 connected via a double bond to CH.

Putting it all together, the entire molecule is:

C(CH3)2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2, but with double bonds in the correct positions.

Wait, no, that's not right because I have double bonds in the formula. Let me write it more accurately.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each "C=" is a double bond. So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So the molecule consists of two double bonds: one between the first and second C in the left part, and another between the sixth and seventh C in the right part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each atom step by step.

Let me count each carbon:

1. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: this is four carbons (each CH3 is one C, the central C, and the CH is another C). Wait, no, (CH3)2C is three carbons: two CH3 groups and one central C. Then the =CH- is another C, so that's four C's so far. Then the next group is -CH2-: that's another C, making five. Then -CH(CH3)-: another C, making six. Then -CH2-: C seven. Then -CH=C(CH3)2: that's two more C's (the CH and the C connected to two CH3 groups). Wait, no. Let me re-examine:

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 3 carbons (two CH3 and one C) connected via a double bond to a CH.
- Then CH2- : another C (so 4)
- CH(CH3)- : another C (5)
- CH2- : another C (6)
- CH=C(CH3)2 : two more C's (the CH and the C with two CH3 groups), making total 8 C's.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me list each C:

1. (CH3)2C= : first C (attached to two CH3)
2. =CH- : second C (double bond to first)
3. CH2- : third C (connected to second)
4. CH(CH3)- : fourth C (connected to third)
5. CH2- : fifth C (connected to fourth)
6. CH=C(...) : sixth C (connected to fifth)
7. C(CH3)2 : seventh C (connected via double bond to sixth)

Wait, no, perhaps the way to count is:

Each group:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each CH3 is one C. The (CH3)2C= is a central C attached to two CH3 and a double bond to CH. Then the rest are CH2, CH(CH3), etc.

But perhaps it's better to just count all the C atoms.

Each (CH3) group has 1 C.

Looking at the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C's: two from the two CH3 groups, and one from the central C, plus the CH, which is another C. So that's 4 C's so far.

Then:

- CH2- : another C (5)
- CH(CH3)- : another C (6)
- CH2- : another C (7)
- CH=C(CH3)2 : two more C's (the CH and the C with CH3 groups) → 9 C's in total.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be considered as:

Each (CH3) group is one C, each CH is one C, etc. Let's count each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : that's 4 C's (two CH3, one central C, and one CH)
2. Then CH2- : 1 C (so 5)
3. CH(CH3)- : 1 C (6)
4. CH2- : 1 C (7)
5. CH=C(CH3)2: two C's (the CH and the C with two CH3 groups), so 9 in total.

Wait, but that seems off. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Let me count the C's:

Each "C" in the formula is a carbon atom.

The entire formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Let me list each C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : this has 3 C's (two CH3 and one central C), then the CH is another C → 4 in this part.
2. CH2- : another C → 5
3. CH(CH3)- : another C → 6
4. CH2- : another C → 7
5. CH=C(CH3)2: the CH is C8, the C with CH3 is C9.

Wait, so 9 C's in total.

Now the H's. Let me count each H.

Each CH3 group has 3 H. Each CH has 1 H. Each CH2 has 2 H. Each C connected to two CH3 groups in a double bond (like C(CH3)2) has no H attached because the double bond would have no H (since it's C=C(CH3)2? Or does it have H's? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think more carefully.

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H.

Each CH group contributes 1 H.

Each CH2 contributes 2 H.

In the given formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Breaking it into each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : this is (CH3)2-C double bonded to CH-.

So:

- Each (CH3) has 3 H → 2 * 3 = 6 H.
- The central C is part of the (CH3)2C group, so it doesn't have any H attached (since it's bonded to two CH3 and the double bond).
- The CH- part has 1 H.

So this part contributes 6 + 1 = 7 H.

2. Next is CH2-: CH2 has 2 H. So that's 2 H added.

3. Then CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H. So that's 1 + 3 = 4 H.

4. Next is CH2-: 2 H.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C=C is double bonded, so the other C is connected to two CH3 groups. The C=C group: the left C (CH) has 1 H, the right C has two CH3 groups which contribute 3*2=6 H. So for this part, the CH=C(CH3)2 contributes 1 (from CH) + 6 (from the two CH3) = 7 H.

Wait, but the C=C is a double bond. So the structure is CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The CH in CH2-CH would have 1 H, and the C=C has a CH on one side and C(CH3)2 on the other. So the CH=C(CH3)2 would have 1 H on the CH and the C with two CH3's has no H attached. So the H's from this part are 1 (from CH) plus 6 (from the two CH3 groups) → 7 H.

Wait, but wait, the CH=C would have the CH on one end and the C(CH3)2 on the other. So the CH would have one H, and the C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, each contributing 3 H → 6 H. So total 7 H in this part.

Now summing all the H's:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 7 H
2. CH2-: 2 → total 9
3. CH(CH3)-:4 → 13
4. CH2-:2 →15
5. CH=C(CH3)2:7 → 22.

Wait, but wait, are we including all the H's correctly?

Let me recount:

Each (CH3) group in the first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → 2 * 3 =6 H.

The CH- in this part: 1 H.

CH2-: 2 H.

CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 H, the CH3 has 3 → 4 H.

CH2-: 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C with two CH3 groups has 3 * 2 =6 H.

So total H's:

6 (from first two CH3) +1 (from CH in first part) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH in last part) +6 (two CH3 in last part) = 6 +1=7; 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+1=16; 16+6=22 H's.

So n=22 H atoms.

m is the number of C atoms. Earlier, we thought it was 9 C's.

Wait, but earlier count was 9 C's. Let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- part: 3 C's (the two CH3 and the central C) plus the CH →4 C's.

Then CH2 → 5.

CH(CH3) →6.

CH2 →7.

CH →8.

C in C(CH3)2 →9.

So total of 9 C's.

So m=9.

n=22.

Now, plugging into the formula:

ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2) × 100] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the compound)]

First, let's compute [m × 1000 + (n/2 × 100)].

m=9 → 9×1000=9000 kJ/mol.

n=22 → (22/2) ×100 =11 ×100=1100 kJ/mol.

So sum is 9000 + 1100 = 10,100 kJ/mol.

Now, subtract the sum of bond energies in the compound.

We need to calculate the total bond energy of all the bonds in the molecule.

The molecule has:

- C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H bonds.

Wait, H-H bonds? The problem gives a bond energy for H-H as 100 kJ/mol, but in our compound, are there any H-H bonds? No. Because all H's are in C-H bonds or within the molecule. So no H-H bonds are present in the compound. So the bond energies we'll consider are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So let's count each type of bond.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list all the bonds and their counts.

Each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let's go step by step.

Looking at each part of the molecule:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Each (CH3) has 3 C-H bonds → 2×3=6.
   - The central C is connected to the two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds?), but wait, actually, in this group, the structure is (CH3)2-C=CH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each type of bond individually.

Let me think about each bond type.

C-C bonds: Each single bond between C atoms.

C=C bonds: Each double bond between C atoms.

C-H bonds: Each single bond between C and H.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count each bond.

First, identify all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - The (CH3)2-C part: each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → 2×3=6 C-H.
   - The C in (CH3)2 is bonded to the adjacent C via a double bond: that's a C=C bond. So one C=C bond.
   - The C=C is between the two C's: so that's one C=C bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to draw the structure or visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the molecule as a chain with substituents and count each bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the entire molecule and count each type of bond.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me model each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two CH3 groups attached to a central C. So, each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → 6 C-H.
   - The central C is bonded to the adjacent C via a double bond (C=C) → 1 C=C bond.

2. CH2-:
   - CH2 is bonded to the previous C via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C bond.
   - Each CH2 has two C-H bonds → 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-:
   - The CH is bonded to the previous CH2 via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C.
   - The CH has one C-H → 1 C-H.
   - The CH3 has three C-H → 3 C-H.

4. CH2-:
   - CH2 is bonded to the previous CH(CH3) via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C.
   - Each CH2 has two C-H → 2 C-H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:
   - The CH is bonded to the previous CH2 via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C.
   - The CH is double-bonded to the adjacent C (C=C) → 1 C=C.
   - The C on the other side of the double bond has two CH3 groups attached → each CH3 has 3 C-H → 2×3=6 C-H.

Now, let's count each type of bond:

C-C bonds:
- Between (CH3)2C and CH-: single bond → 1.
- Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1.
- Between CH(CH3) and CH2: 1.
- Between CH2 and CH: 1.
Total C-C bonds: 4.

Wait, but perhaps I missed some. Let me recount.

Looking at each connection:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each -C-C- is a single bond. Let's count each single C-C bond.

- Between (CH3)2C and CH: 1 (but it's a double bond, so no C-C there).
- Between CH and CH2: 1 C-C.
- Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1 C-C.
- Between CH(CH3) and CH2:1 C-C.
- Between CH2 and CH:1 C-C.
- Between CH and C in C=C: no, that's a double bond.
So total C-C single bonds: 5?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Each segment is connected by a single bond except where there are double bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the entire structure as a chain with substituents.

The molecule can be broken down as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond is:

- (CH3)2C=CH- connected via a double bond, so the next bond is CH-CH2, which is a single bond.

So:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- has a double bond between the first and second C's, so that's one C=C.

2. The next bond after CH- is a single bond (CH-CH2): that's a C-C bond.

3. Then CH2-CH(CH3): another C-C.

4. Then CH(CH3)-CH2: another C-C.

5. CH2-CH: another C-C.

6. CH=C(...): another double bond (C=C).

So, in terms of single bonds (C-C), there are 5 (since each - is a single bond except the double bonds).

Wait, but each C-C is a single bond, so the number of C-C bonds would be the number of single bonds between C atoms.

Let me count:

- Each of the single bonds between the C's:

From (CH3)2C=CH- to CH2: that's a single C-C.

From CH2 to CH(CH3): another single C-C.

From CH(CH3) to CH2: another.

From CH2 to CH: another.

From CH to C in the CH=C: that's a double bond, so no C-C here.

Wait, so that's four single C-C bonds. Plus any others?

Wait, in the (CH3)2C=CH- group, each CH3 is connected to the central C via single bonds. So for each CH3, that's a C-C bond.

Wait, no, the CH3 groups are attached to the central C, so that's single bonds between C and C (from CH3 to central C). Each CH3 contributes one C-C bond.

Wait, no, in (CH3)2C=CH-, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups via single C-C bonds. So that's two C-C bonds.

Similarly, the CH=C(CH3)2 group has the C connected to two CH3 groups via single C-C bonds. So that's two more C-C bonds.

So let's recount all the C-C bonds.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two C-C bonds (from central C to each CH3).
   - The C=C bond (so not a C-C).
   - The CH- is connected to the next CH2 via a single bond → another C-C.

2. CH2-CH(CH3): another C-C.

3. CH(CH3)-CH2: another C-C.

4. CH2-CH: another C-C.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:
   - The CH is connected via a single bond to the C in the double bond → but that's a single C-C.
   - The C in the double bond is connected to each CH3 group via C-C bonds → two C-C bonds.

Wait, but the C=C is a double bond, so any single bonds from that C are separate. So the CH in CH=C is connected via a single bond to the C in the double bond. That's another C-C.

And then, the C in the double bond (C=C) is connected to two CH3 groups, each via a single C-C bond. So two more C-C bonds.

So let me sum them up:

- From (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two C-C bonds (from CH3 groups).
   - One C-C bond to CH2.

Total so far: 3.

- From CH2-CH(CH3): 1 → total 4.

- From CH(CH3)-CH2: 1 → total 5.

- From CH2-CH: 1 → total 6.

- From CH=C(CH3)2:
   - One C-C bond (CH to C=C).
   - Two C-C bonds (C=C to each CH3).
   → 3 → total 9 C-C bonds.

Wait, that's a bit high, but perhaps correct.

So the total C-C bonds: 9.

No, wait, I think I'm overcounting. Let me think again.

Each CH3 group contributes one C-C bond to the central C. So in (CH3)2C=CH-, there are two C-C bonds (two CH3's).

The central C is connected via a double bond to the next C (so no single bond there), but the CH is connected to the next CH2 via a single bond → that's one C-C.

In the middle, each CH2-CH and so on contribute single bonds.

At the end, the C in the CH=C is connected via a single bond to the CH, and the C=C is connected to two CH3 groups via single bonds.

So the C-C bonds would be: each CH3 group contributes one, each single bond between C's in the chain contributes one.

Let me try a different approach. The entire molecule is a chain with substituents, so each single bond between C atoms counts as a C-C bond.

We can count the number of single C-C bonds as (number of C atoms) minus 1 (since each additional bond reduces the count). Wait, no, because each C-C bond connects two C's. So the number of C-C bonds in a chain would be (number of C atoms) - 1, assuming it's a straight chain without any branches. But this molecule has branches, so that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each single bond between two C's is a C-C bond, and each double bond contributes one less C-C bond.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of C-C and C=C bonds.

The molecule has two C=C bonds (the two double bonds). The rest are single C-C bonds.

So for the entire molecule:

Number of C-C bonds = total number of single bonds between C's.

Each time two C's are connected by a single bond, that's a C-C.

So, let's count each single bond between C's.

In the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list each single bond between C's:

a. (CH3)2C connected to CH (but via double bond, so no single C-C here).
b. CH connected to CH2 (single bond) → 1.
c. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) (single bond) → 2.
d. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →3.
e. CH2 connected to CH →4.
f. CH connected to C in C=C (single bond) →5.
g. C in C=C connected to each CH3 → two single bonds (6 and 7).

Wait, but each CH3 is connected via a single bond to the C in the C=C. So that's two more.

So total C-C bonds: 7.

And the C=C bonds: 2.

Wait, that's 7 C-C and 2 C=C.

Additionally, the CH3 groups each have a C-C bond with the central C.

Wait, perhaps I should think that each CH3 contributes a C-C bond.

So in (CH3)2C=CH-, each CH3 is attached to the central C via a C-C bond.

So that's two more C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds would be 7 (from above) plus 2 → 9.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Every time two C's are connected by a single bond, it's a C-C.

So, each (CH3) group contributes a C-C bond to the central C.

The structure is:

C(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write each C with their connections.

But maybe it's taking too much time, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that I can count the number of each bond.

But given time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the data I have.

Assuming that I have 9 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, and the rest are C-H bonds.

Wait, but I need to count all the bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total number of each bond.

The molecule has:

- Each (CH3) group contributes 3 C-H bonds. Let me count how many CH3 groups are present.

Looking at the formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C: two CH3 groups → 2×3=6 C-H.
- CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups → 2×3=6 C-H.
- The other groups: 

Looking at each part:

- The CH in (CH3)2C=CH-: 1 C-H.
- The CH2 groups: each has two C-H → let's see how many CH2 groups we have.

In the chain:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the CH2 groups are:

- CH2 after the CH=.
- CH2 after CH(CH3).

So two CH2 groups → each contributes two C-H bonds → 2×2=4.

- The CH(CH3) group: 1 C-H (from CH) and the CH3 contributes 3 C-H → total 4.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the counts.

So let's try to count all C-H bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two CH3 → 6 C-H.
   - CH → 1 C-H.
   → 7.

2. CH2-:
   → 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-:
   → 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4.

4. CH2-:
   → 2.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:
   → 1 (from CH) + 6 (from two CH3) =7.

Total C-H bonds: 7 +2 +4 +2 +7 =22.

Which matches the earlier count of 22 H's → 22 C-H bonds.

So, number of C-H bonds:22.

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see. Each C in the chain (except the ends) is connected to two other C's, but each C-C bond is counted once.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C-C bond once.

The molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The structure can be thought of as a chain of C's with substituents.

Each single bond between C's is a C-C bond.

So, the chain goes: C - C - C - C - C - C - C - C.

Wait, no. Let me see:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → C1 connected to C2 via double bond.

2. C2 is connected to C3 (CH2) via single bond.

3. C3 connected to C4 (CH(CH3)) via single bond.

4. C4 connected to C5 (CH2) via single bond.

5. C5 connected to C6 (CH) via single bond.

6. C6 connected to C7 (C in C=C) via double bond.

But wait, C7 is connected to two CH3 groups via single bonds.

Hmm, perhaps the chain has 7 C's, but considering branches.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds can be found by:

Number of C-C single bonds = (number of C atoms) - number of double bonds - number of rings.

But the molecule is a chain, so number of C-C single bonds = 9 C's - 2 double bonds =7.

So 7 C-C bonds.

Plus, any C-C bonds from substituents.

Wait, each CH3 group is connected to a C via a single bond, so each contributes a C-C bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-, there are two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Similarly, in CH=C(CH3)2, the C is connected to two CH3 groups → two more C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds: 7 (from the chain) +2 (from first group) +2 (from last group) =11.

Wait, that's 11 C-C bonds.

But each CH3's C-C is only once. So perhaps that's correct.

So, C-C bonds:11.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:22.

Now, the bond energies:

Each C-C bond contributes 200 kJ/mol.

Each C=C bond contributes 300 kJ/mol.

Each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ/mol.

H-H bonds are not present, so no contribution.

So sum of bond energies in the compound:

= (number of C-C bonds × 200) + (number of C=C ×300) + (number of C-H ×400).

Plugging the numbers:

= (11 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400).

Calculating each part:

11 ×200 =2200.

2 ×300=600.

22 ×400=8800.

Sum: 2200 +600 =2800; 2800 +8800=11,600.

So sum of bond energies is 11,600 kJ/mol.

Now, the formula:

ΔHf° = [10,100] - [11,600] = 10,100 -11,600 = -1,500 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's a negative value. But looking at the options, the choices are all positive except option B, which is 67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because the options don't include -1500.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, the formula I used was:

ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2 ×100)] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the compound)].

But let me recheck the calculation.

m=9, n=22.

So m ×1000 =9000.

n/2 ×100 =11 ×100 =1100.

Sum: 9000+1100=10,100.

Σ bond energies: 11,600.

So 10,100 -11,600 = -1,500.

Hmm, negative ΔHf° would mean the molecule is more stable than its elements, which is possible, but looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is 10,100 + 11,600? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe I should subtract the bond energies of the compound from the sum, but perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the energies released when forming bonds in the products.

Alternatively, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum bond energies of product bonds].

But the product is the compound, and the reactants are C and H2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bonds formed in product]

So, bonds broken in reactants (C and H2) → these are the bonds in their standard states.

Bonds formed in product → bonds in the compound.

So, bonds broken:

- For C: each C comes from graphite, which has C-C bonds. So, each C requires breaking x C-C bonds. How many C-C bonds are in graphite per C atom? Graphite is a 2D lattice where each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So per C atom, there are 1.5 C-C bonds. So for m C atoms, the total C-C bonds broken would be (m × 1.5).

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of C as 1000 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom to form an atom in the gas phase. For graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared. So to atomize one mole of C, you need to break (3/2) moles of C-C bonds. So for m moles of C, it's (3/2) × m × bond energy of C-C.

Wait, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of C as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom in the compound comes from graphite, and the energy required to form one C atom is 1000 kJ/mol. So the total energy for C is m × 1000.

Similarly, each H atom comes from H2. So each H2 molecule has one bond. To get one H atom, you need to break half a bond. So for n H atoms, the energy is (n/2) × bond energy of H-H.

So the total energy for the reactants is (m × 1000) + (n/2 × 100).

The bonds formed in the product are all the bonds in the compound. The sum of the bond energies is 11,600 kJ/mol.

So ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2 ×100)] - [Σ (bond energies of product)].

Which, as earlier, gives 10,100 -11,600 = -1,500.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the count of C-C bonds. Let me recount.

If the molecule has 9 C's, and the number of C-C bonds is 9 - number of rings or double bonds. Since there are two double bonds, the number of C-C single bonds would be 9 - 2 - (number of rings). But the molecule is a chain, so no rings.

Wait, no, I think that approach doesn't account for branches. Alternatively, for a chain with all single bonds, the number of C-C bonds would be (number of C's) -1. But with double bonds, each double bond reduces the number of single bonds by one.

So in a chain with two double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds would be (number of C's) -1 - number of double bonds.

Number of C's:9.

So single C-C bonds:9-1-2=6.

But that's for a straight chain. However, our molecule has branches, so that approach might not be accurate.

Perhaps the correct way is to count each C-C bond individually.

Let me try again, perhaps I missed some.

Looking at the molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group contributes a C-C bond to the central C.

So for the first (CH3)2C=CH- group:

- Two C-C bonds (from CH3 groups).
- One C=C bond (double bond between C and CH).

Then, the CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond → another C-C.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → another C-C.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 → another C-C.

CH2 connected to CH → another C-C.

CH connected to C in C=C → another C-C.

C in C=C connected to two CH3 groups → two more C-C bonds.

So, counting each:

1. (CH3)2C: 2 C-C (from CH3's).

2. C=CH: no single C-C, but the next bond is CH-CH2 → C-C (3).

3. CH2-CH(CH3): C-C (4).

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: C-C (5).

5. CH2-CH: C-C (6).

6. CH-C (in C=C): C-C (7).

7. C=C-CH3 (two times): two C-C bonds (8 and 9).

So total C-C bonds:9.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:22.

So the bond energies:

C-C:9 ×200=1800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total:1800 +600=2400; 2400 +8800= 11,200.

So the sum of bond energies in the compound is 11,200.

So ΔHf° = [10,100] - [11,200] = -1,100.

But the options don't have this. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around: sum of product bonds minus sum of reactant bonds. Because in the formation reaction, we're forming the compound from elements, releasing energy if the product bonds are stronger.

Wait, no. The formula for enthalpy of formation from bond energies is usually:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken) in reactants ] - [Σ (bonds formed) in products].

So that would be:

ΔHf° = [ (9 ×1000) + (22 ×50) ) ] - [ (9 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400) ) ]

Wait, wait, wait. Because for the H atoms, each H comes from H2, so each H requires breaking 0.5 H-H bonds. For 22 H atoms, that's 22/2=11 H-H bonds broken. Each H-H is 100 kJ/mol → 11 ×100=1100.

So the correct calculation is:

ΔHf° = [ (9 ×1000) + (22 ×50) ] - [ (9 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400) ]

Wait, 22 ×50 → because each H atom requires 0.5 ×100 →50 per H.

So:

Reactant bonds broken:

C:9 ×1000=9000.

H:22 ×50=1100.

Total:9000+1100=10,100.

Product bonds formed:

C-C:9 ×200=1800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total product bonds:1800+600=2400; 2400+8800=11,200.

So ΔHf° =10,100 -11,200 = -1,100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I overcounted the C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Alternative approach: each single bond in the molecule is a C-C bond.

Let me consider the structure again:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH:
   - Each CH3 has a C-C bond to the central C → 2 bonds.
   - The central C is double-bonded to CH → no single bond here.

2. CH-CH2:
   - Single bond →1 C-C bond.

3. CH2-CH(CH3):
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2:
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

5. CH2-CH:
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

6. CH-C (in C=C):
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

7. C=C connected to CH3 groups:
   - Each CH3 has a C-C bond →2 C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds:

2 (from first group) +1 (CH-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3)-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH) +1 (CH-C) +2 (from CH3 groups) → total 9.

Yes, that's 9.

So with this, sum of product bonds:

9×200=1800; 2×300=600; 22×400=8800.

Total: 1800+600=2400; 2400+8800=11,200.

So 10,100 -11,200 = -1,100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the sum of the product bonds minus the sum of the reactant bonds.

Because when you form bonds, you release energy. So if the product bonds are stronger (have higher bond energies), the overall enthalpy of formation would be exothermic (negative).

But the formula I'm using is [reactant bonds broken] - [product bonds formed].

But if the product bonds are stronger, that would result in a negative ΔHf°, which is possible for stable compounds.

But the options don't have a negative value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using kJ/mol, but the options are in kJ/mol except option C and D, which are per gram.

Wait, the problem says "Calculate the enthalpy of formation of [compound]".

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

Wait, option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which is the same as the sum of the product bonds (11,200 kJ/mol). But my calculation was 10,100 -11,200 = -1,100.

But if the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation, which is the energy released when forming the compound from its elements, then perhaps the formula is the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of product bonds)] - [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds)].

But that would be 11,200 -10,100=1,100.

Which is positive.

But that would make option A (11,200) not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me check.

The standard formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products].

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants broken] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds formed].

Which is what I did earlier.

But according to that, I get -1,100.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Alternative approach: perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 8.

Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Each CH3 contributes a C-C bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: two C-C bonds.

CH-CH2: one.

CH2-CH(CH3): one.

CH(CH3)-CH2: one.

CH2-CH: one.

CH-C (in C=C): one.

C=C with two CH3 groups: two.

So that's 2+1+1+1+1+1+2=9.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the molecule as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which actually has 10 C atoms. Wait, let me recount the C's.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of C atoms.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is one C.

Let me list all C's:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - (CH3) → C1
   - (CH3) → C2
   - C (attached to both CH3) → C3
   - =CH- → C4.

2. CH2- → C5.

3. CH(CH3)- → C6.

4. CH2- → C7.

5. CH- → C8.

6. C=C(CH3)2: the C in the double bond is C9, and each CH3 is C10 and C11? No, wait: the (CH3)2 in the last part are attached to C9.

Wait, no, the structure is CH=C(CH3)2 → so the C in the double bond is C9, and each CH3 is attached to C9.

So the C's are C1 to C9.

Wait, that's 9 C's.

So I think the count is correct.

But I'm stuck because the calculation gives me -1,100, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as treating each C as coming from CO2 or H2O, but the problem states that the enthalpy of atomization is given, so that approach should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are given in reverse, like C-C is 300 and C=C is 200, but the problem states C-C is 200 and C=C is 300.

Wait, no, the problem says:

Bond energy of C-C =200 kJ/mol

Bond energy of C=C=300 kJ/mol

So I used them correctly.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. But the options include both.

Wait, the problem states, "calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2."

The given bond energies are per mole.

The options include per mole and per gram.

So perhaps I need to calculate the molar mass of the compound first.

The molecular formula is:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me determine the molecular formula.

Each C is counted as 9, as before.

Hydrogen: earlier count was 22.

So molecular formula is C9H22.

The molar mass would be (9 ×12) + (22 ×1) = 108 +22=130 g/mol.

So if the ΔHf° is -1,100 kJ/mol, then per gram would be -1,100 /130 ≈ -8.46 kJ/g.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the bond energies.

Wait, perhaps when the molecule is formed, the bonds formed are the sum of all the bonds, but perhaps the approach is different.

Another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as the sum of the energies of the bonds broken in the reactants minus the sum of the bonds formed in the product.

But perhaps I should calculate it as:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies of compound).

Which would be 10,100 -11,200= -1,100.

But again, options don't match.

Looking back at the options, option A is 11200 kJ/mol. Which is exactly the sum of the product bonds (11,200).

But that would be if the formula were ΔHf° = sum of product bonds - sum of reactant bonds → 11,200 -10,100=1,100.

But that's not option A.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong, and it's the sum of product bonds minus reactant bonds.

So 11,200 (product) -10,100 (reactant) =1,100.

But none of the options have 1,100.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed some H's.

Wait, let me recount the number of H's.

The molecular formula is C9H22.

So n=22 H's.

Earlier count of C-H bonds is 22. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the bonds are counted as the sum of all bonds in the molecule, but the formula for enthalpy of formation requires the sum of all bonds in the reactants minus sum of all bonds in the products.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-express the formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (reactant bonds)] - [Σ (product bonds)].

Which would be:

= [ (9 ×1000) + (22 ×50) ] - [ (9 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400) ]

= [9000 + 1100] - [1800 +600 +8800]

=10,100 -11,200 = -1,100.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative idea: perhaps the formula is the sum of the bond energies of the product minus the sum of the bond energies of the reactants.

That would be 11,200 -10,100=1,100.

But that would imply that the formation is endothermic, which would mean the molecule is less stable than its elements. But many hydrocarbons have negative enthalpies of formation.

But since the options don't have 1,100, I'm stuck.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which matches the sum of the product bonds. So perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the bond energies of the product, which is option A.

But why would that be the case? Because the formula for enthalpy of formation isn't just the sum of product bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and they're asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, which would be the sum of all bond energies in the product.

In that case, the answer would be 11,200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But that's not the standard approach for enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has only 8 C-C bonds.

If that's the case, the sum would be:

8 ×200=1600.

2 ×300=600.

22 ×400=8800.

Total: 1600+600=2200 +8800=11,000.

Then ΔHf° =10,100 -11,000=-900.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

7×200=1400.

+600 (C=C) +8800 (C-H) = 1400+600=2000 +8800=10,800.

ΔHf°=10,100 -10,800 =-700.

Not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the number of each bond type and plug into the formula without worrying about the exact count.

But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 11200 kJ/mol, which matches the sum of the product bonds.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds, multiply by their respective bond energies, sum them, and that's the answer.

But why would that be the case? Because the options include 11200.

So perhaps the answer is A)11200.

But I'm not sure. However, based on the calculation, the sum of the product bonds is 11,200, which is option A.

- **C-C bond energy:** 200 kJ/mol  
- **C=C bond energy:** 300 kJ/mol  
- **C-H bond energy:** 400 kJ/mol  

\[
\text{Total bond energy of product} = (9 \times 200) + (2 \times 300) + (22 \times 400)
\]
\[
= 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11,200 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the reactants
The reactants are carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H2).  
- **Enthalpy of atomization of C:** 1000 kJ/mol  
- **Bond energy of H-H:** 100 kJ/mol  

For **C9H22**:
- **Energy to break C-C bonds in graphite:**  
  Each carbon atom in graphite is bonded to three others, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol per carbon atom.  
  \[
  \text{Energy for C} = 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

- **Energy to break H-H bonds in H2:**  
  Each H2 molecule has one H-H bond. For 22 hydrogen atoms, 11 H-H bonds are broken.  
  \[
  \text{Energy for H} = \frac{22}{2} \times 100 = 11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

- **Total energy for reactants:**  
  \[
  9000 + 1100 = 10,100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Sum of reactant bonds} - \text{Sum of product bonds}
\]
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 10,100 - 11,200 = -1,100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
The calculated enthalpy of formation is **-1,100 kJ/mol**, but none of the options match this value. However, the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds is **11,200 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to **Option A**. It appears the question may be asking for the total bond energy of the product rather than the enthalpy of formation.

### Final Answer:
The total bond energy of the product is **11,200 kJ/mol**, which matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy of formation calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me see if I can visualize the structure first. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds, maybe? Because I see two C=CH groups and two C(CH3)2 at the ends. Wait, no, actually, let me count the double bonds. Each "C=" would be a double bond, so I think there are two double bonds in this molecule.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So let's break it down. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, then a CH2-, then a CH(CH3)-, another CH2-, then CH=C(CH3)2. So the molecule is probably something like a chain with substituents and two double bonds. Maybe it's a diene or something more complex.

The problem gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. The bond energies are: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. I remember that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is calculated using the bond energies. The formula involves the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products or something like that.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, that would be from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas. But the problem gives me bond energies, so perhaps I need to calculate it using bond dissociation energies (or bond energies) instead.

The general formula I remember is: ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds] divided by something? Wait, no, the other way around. Wait, no, maybe it's the sum of all the bond energies in the reactants minus the sum in the products. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of the bonds broken minus the sum of bonds formed.

Wait, no. The enthalpy change when forming the molecule from its elements would be the sum of the energies of the bonds broken (in the reactants) minus the sum of the energies of the bonds formed (in the products). So, for the formation reaction:

Elements (C and H) → Compound.

So, in this reaction, the bonds in the compound are formed, which requires energy to break the bonds in the reactants.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as the enthalpy of formation being calculated using the bond energies of the compound. The formula is usually written as:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds)] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds)]

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing this up. Another approach: The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So, each carbon atom in the compound comes from graphite (C), and each hydrogen comes from H2 gas.

The process involves breaking bonds in the reactants (C and H2) and forming bonds in the product (the compound).

The bond energies provided can be used to calculate the total energy change. 

So the steps would be:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bond in the compound.
2. Multiply each bond count by its bond energy.
3. Sum all the bond energies for the product (the compound) → this is the energy of bonds formed.
4. Subtract the sum of bond energies for the reactants (the elements) → but wait, the reactants are C and H2, so their bonds are being broken.

Wait, no. To make the compound, we start with C and H2. So we need to break the C-C bonds (if any) in graphite and the H-H bonds in H2. But wait, graphite is an extended lattice of C atoms with each C bonded to three others. So each C in graphite is part of multiple C-C bonds, but when we form the compound, each C comes from breaking those C-C bonds in graphite. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the compound) - (sum of bond energies of C and H in their standard states)

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Ah, yes! The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C)] + [Σ (number of H atoms × bond energy of H-H / 2)] - [Σ (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule)]

Wait, why divided by 2? Because each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so for each H atom in the compound, we're breaking half an H-H bond.

Let me make sure. Suppose the compound has n H atoms. Each H comes from H2, so each H requires breaking a bond. So total H-H bonds broken would be (n/2), each contributing 100 kJ/mol. So the total energy for H is (n/2) * 100.

Similarly, for each C atom, it's coming from graphite. But the enthalpy of atomization of C is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom contributes 1000 kJ/mol to the enthalpy of formation. So for m C atoms, it's m × 1000.

Then, the total energy from the reactants is (m × 1000) + (n/2 × 100). The bonds in the product (the compound) are formed, so the bond energies of the compound are subtracted because bond formation releases energy (it's exothermic). So the formula becomes:

ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2) × 100] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the compound)]

So, the problem is to calculate this.

Now, I need to find m (number of C atoms) and n (number of H atoms) in the given compound.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups, each contributing 3 H. So (CH3)2 contributes 6 H, and the C is connected to two CH3, one CH, and the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H in the entire molecule.

Let me parse the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Breaking it down into each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : This is a propene-like group. The (CH3)2C=CH- part: each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 H. The central C is connected to two CH3, a double bond CH, and a single bond to the next CH2. So in this part, C count is 4 (2 from CH3, one from C, one from CH). Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH- is actually three carbons: two CH3 attached to a C which is double-bonded to CH-. So that's 3 C's and 7 H's (each CH3:3×2=6 H, plus the CH has one H, and the double bond C has another H. Wait no, the structure is (CH3)2-C=CH-. So the C=C is between the two C's. So the first C is (CH3)2-C, the second is double-bonded to CH-.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to count all the carbons and hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be simplified. Let me write the formula in a more straightforward way.

Wait, maybe I should better consider the molecular formula of the compound to find m and n.

The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me expand each group:

Each "(CH3)2C" is C(CH3)2.

Each "CH=C(CH3)2" is C(CH3)2 connected via a double bond to CH.

Putting it all together, the entire molecule is:

C(CH3)2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2, but with double bonds in the correct positions.

Wait, no, that's not right because I have double bonds in the formula. Let me write it more accurately.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each "C=" is a double bond. So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So the molecule consists of two double bonds: one between the first and second C in the left part, and another between the sixth and seventh C in the right part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each atom step by step.

Let me count each carbon:

1. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: this is four carbons (each CH3 is one C, the central C, and the CH is another C). Wait, no, (CH3)2C is three carbons: two CH3 groups and one central C. Then the =CH- is another C, so that's four C's so far. Then the next group is -CH2-: that's another C, making five. Then -CH(CH3)-: another C, making six. Then -CH2-: C seven. Then -CH=C(CH3)2: that's two more C's (the CH and the C connected to two CH3 groups). Wait, no. Let me re-examine:

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 3 carbons (two CH3 and one C) connected via a double bond to a CH.
- Then CH2- : another C (so 4)
- CH(CH3)- : another C (5)
- CH2- : another C (6)
- CH=C(CH3)2 : two more C's (the CH and the C with two CH3 groups), making total 8 C's.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me list each C:

1. (CH3)2C= : first C (attached to two CH3)
2. =CH- : second C (double bond to first)
3. CH2- : third C (connected to second)
4. CH(CH3)- : fourth C (connected to third)
5. CH2- : fifth C (connected to fourth)
6. CH=C(...) : sixth C (connected to fifth)
7. C(CH3)2 : seventh C (connected via double bond to sixth)

Wait, no, perhaps the way to count is:

Each group:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each CH3 is one C. The (CH3)2C= is a central C attached to two CH3 and a double bond to CH. Then the rest are CH2, CH(CH3), etc.

But perhaps it's better to just count all the C atoms.

Each (CH3) group has 1 C.

Looking at the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C's: two from the two CH3 groups, and one from the central C, plus the CH, which is another C. So that's 4 C's so far.

Then:

- CH2- : another C (5)
- CH(CH3)- : another C (6)
- CH2- : another C (7)
- CH=C(CH3)2 : two more C's (the CH and the C with CH3 groups) → 9 C's in total.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be considered as:

Each (CH3) group is one C, each CH is one C, etc. Let's count each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : that's 4 C's (two CH3, one central C, and one CH)
2. Then CH2- : 1 C (so 5)
3. CH(CH3)- : 1 C (6)
4. CH2- : 1 C (7)
5. CH=C(CH3)2: two C's (the CH and the C with two CH3 groups), so 9 in total.

Wait, but that seems off. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Let me count the C's:

Each "C" in the formula is a carbon atom.

The entire formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Let me list each C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : this has 3 C's (two CH3 and one central C), then the CH is another C → 4 in this part.
2. CH2- : another C → 5
3. CH(CH3)- : another C → 6
4. CH2- : another C → 7
5. CH=C(CH3)2: the CH is C8, the C with CH3 is C9.

Wait, so 9 C's in total.

Now the H's. Let me count each H.

Each CH3 group has 3 H. Each CH has 1 H. Each CH2 has 2 H. Each C connected to two CH3 groups in a double bond (like C(CH3)2) has no H attached because the double bond would have no H (since it's C=C(CH3)2? Or does it have H's? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think more carefully.

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H.

Each CH group contributes 1 H.

Each CH2 contributes 2 H.

In the given formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Breaking it into each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : this is (CH3)2-C double bonded to CH-.

So:

- Each (CH3) has 3 H → 2 * 3 = 6 H.
- The central C is part of the (CH3)2C group, so it doesn't have any H attached (since it's bonded to two CH3 and the double bond).
- The CH- part has 1 H.

So this part contributes 6 + 1 = 7 H.

2. Next is CH2-: CH2 has 2 H. So that's 2 H added.

3. Then CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H. So that's 1 + 3 = 4 H.

4. Next is CH2-: 2 H.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C=C is double bonded, so the other C is connected to two CH3 groups. The C=C group: the left C (CH) has 1 H, the right C has two CH3 groups which contribute 3*2=6 H. So for this part, the CH=C(CH3)2 contributes 1 (from CH) + 6 (from the two CH3) = 7 H.

Wait, but the C=C is a double bond. So the structure is CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The CH in CH2-CH would have 1 H, and the C=C has a CH on one side and C(CH3)2 on the other. So the CH=C(CH3)2 would have 1 H on the CH and the C with two CH3's has no H attached. So the H's from this part are 1 (from CH) plus 6 (from the two CH3 groups) → 7 H.

Wait, but wait, the CH=C would have the CH on one end and the C(CH3)2 on the other. So the CH would have one H, and the C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, each contributing 3 H → 6 H. So total 7 H in this part.

Now summing all the H's:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 7 H
2. CH2-: 2 → total 9
3. CH(CH3)-:4 → 13
4. CH2-:2 →15
5. CH=C(CH3)2:7 → 22.

Wait, but wait, are we including all the H's correctly?

Let me recount:

Each (CH3) group in the first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → 2 * 3 =6 H.

The CH- in this part: 1 H.

CH2-: 2 H.

CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 H, the CH3 has 3 → 4 H.

CH2-: 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C with two CH3 groups has 3 * 2 =6 H.

So total H's:

6 (from first two CH3) +1 (from CH in first part) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH in last part) +6 (two CH3 in last part) = 6 +1=7; 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+1=16; 16+6=22 H's.

So n=22 H atoms.

m is the number of C atoms. Earlier, we thought it was 9 C's.

Wait, but earlier count was 9 C's. Let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- part: 3 C's (the two CH3 and the central C) plus the CH →4 C's.

Then CH2 → 5.

CH(CH3) →6.

CH2 →7.

CH →8.

C in C(CH3)2 →9.

So total of 9 C's.

So m=9.

n=22.

Now, plugging into the formula:

ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2) × 100] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the compound)]

First, let's compute [m × 1000 + (n/2 × 100)].

m=9 → 9×1000=9000 kJ/mol.

n=22 → (22/2) ×100 =11 ×100=1100 kJ/mol.

So sum is 9000 + 1100 = 10,100 kJ/mol.

Now, subtract the sum of bond energies in the compound.

We need to calculate the total bond energy of all the bonds in the molecule.

The molecule has:

- C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H bonds.

Wait, H-H bonds? The problem gives a bond energy for H-H as 100 kJ/mol, but in our compound, are there any H-H bonds? No. Because all H's are in C-H bonds or within the molecule. So no H-H bonds are present in the compound. So the bond energies we'll consider are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So let's count each type of bond.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list all the bonds and their counts.

Each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let's go step by step.

Looking at each part of the molecule:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Each (CH3) has 3 C-H bonds → 2×3=6.
   - The central C is connected to the two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds?), but wait, actually, in this group, the structure is (CH3)2-C=CH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each type of bond individually.

Let me think about each bond type.

C-C bonds: Each single bond between C atoms.

C=C bonds: Each double bond between C atoms.

C-H bonds: Each single bond between C and H.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count each bond.

First, identify all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - The (CH3)2-C part: each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → 2×3=6 C-H.
   - The C in (CH3)2 is bonded to the adjacent C via a double bond: that's a C=C bond. So one C=C bond.
   - The C=C is between the two C's: so that's one C=C bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to draw the structure or visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the molecule as a chain with substituents and count each bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the entire molecule and count each type of bond.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me model each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two CH3 groups attached to a central C. So, each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → 6 C-H.
   - The central C is bonded to the adjacent C via a double bond (C=C) → 1 C=C bond.

2. CH2-:
   - CH2 is bonded to the previous C via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C bond.
   - Each CH2 has two C-H bonds → 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-:
   - The CH is bonded to the previous CH2 via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C.
   - The CH has one C-H → 1 C-H.
   - The CH3 has three C-H → 3 C-H.

4. CH2-:
   - CH2 is bonded to the previous CH(CH3) via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C.
   - Each CH2 has two C-H → 2 C-H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:
   - The CH is bonded to the previous CH2 via a single bond (C-C) → 1 C-C.
   - The CH is double-bonded to the adjacent C (C=C) → 1 C=C.
   - The C on the other side of the double bond has two CH3 groups attached → each CH3 has 3 C-H → 2×3=6 C-H.

Now, let's count each type of bond:

C-C bonds:
- Between (CH3)2C and CH-: single bond → 1.
- Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1.
- Between CH(CH3) and CH2: 1.
- Between CH2 and CH: 1.
Total C-C bonds: 4.

Wait, but perhaps I missed some. Let me recount.

Looking at each connection:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each -C-C- is a single bond. Let's count each single C-C bond.

- Between (CH3)2C and CH: 1 (but it's a double bond, so no C-C there).
- Between CH and CH2: 1 C-C.
- Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1 C-C.
- Between CH(CH3) and CH2:1 C-C.
- Between CH2 and CH:1 C-C.
- Between CH and C in C=C: no, that's a double bond.
So total C-C single bonds: 5?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Each segment is connected by a single bond except where there are double bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the entire structure as a chain with substituents.

The molecule can be broken down as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond is:

- (CH3)2C=CH- connected via a double bond, so the next bond is CH-CH2, which is a single bond.

So:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- has a double bond between the first and second C's, so that's one C=C.

2. The next bond after CH- is a single bond (CH-CH2): that's a C-C bond.

3. Then CH2-CH(CH3): another C-C.

4. Then CH(CH3)-CH2: another C-C.

5. CH2-CH: another C-C.

6. CH=C(...): another double bond (C=C).

So, in terms of single bonds (C-C), there are 5 (since each - is a single bond except the double bonds).

Wait, but each C-C is a single bond, so the number of C-C bonds would be the number of single bonds between C atoms.

Let me count:

- Each of the single bonds between the C's:

From (CH3)2C=CH- to CH2: that's a single C-C.

From CH2 to CH(CH3): another single C-C.

From CH(CH3) to CH2: another.

From CH2 to CH: another.

From CH to C in the CH=C: that's a double bond, so no C-C here.

Wait, so that's four single C-C bonds. Plus any others?

Wait, in the (CH3)2C=CH- group, each CH3 is connected to the central C via single bonds. So for each CH3, that's a C-C bond.

Wait, no, the CH3 groups are attached to the central C, so that's single bonds between C and C (from CH3 to central C). Each CH3 contributes one C-C bond.

Wait, no, in (CH3)2C=CH-, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups via single C-C bonds. So that's two C-C bonds.

Similarly, the CH=C(CH3)2 group has the C connected to two CH3 groups via single C-C bonds. So that's two more C-C bonds.

So let's recount all the C-C bonds.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two C-C bonds (from central C to each CH3).
   - The C=C bond (so not a C-C).
   - The CH- is connected to the next CH2 via a single bond → another C-C.

2. CH2-CH(CH3): another C-C.

3. CH(CH3)-CH2: another C-C.

4. CH2-CH: another C-C.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:
   - The CH is connected via a single bond to the C in the double bond → but that's a single C-C.
   - The C in the double bond is connected to each CH3 group via C-C bonds → two C-C bonds.

Wait, but the C=C is a double bond, so any single bonds from that C are separate. So the CH in CH=C is connected via a single bond to the C in the double bond. That's another C-C.

And then, the C in the double bond (C=C) is connected to two CH3 groups, each via a single C-C bond. So two more C-C bonds.

So let me sum them up:

- From (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two C-C bonds (from CH3 groups).
   - One C-C bond to CH2.

Total so far: 3.

- From CH2-CH(CH3): 1 → total 4.

- From CH(CH3)-CH2: 1 → total 5.

- From CH2-CH: 1 → total 6.

- From CH=C(CH3)2:
   - One C-C bond (CH to C=C).
   - Two C-C bonds (C=C to each CH3).
   → 3 → total 9 C-C bonds.

Wait, that's a bit high, but perhaps correct.

So the total C-C bonds: 9.

No, wait, I think I'm overcounting. Let me think again.

Each CH3 group contributes one C-C bond to the central C. So in (CH3)2C=CH-, there are two C-C bonds (two CH3's).

The central C is connected via a double bond to the next C (so no single bond there), but the CH is connected to the next CH2 via a single bond → that's one C-C.

In the middle, each CH2-CH and so on contribute single bonds.

At the end, the C in the CH=C is connected via a single bond to the CH, and the C=C is connected to two CH3 groups via single bonds.

So the C-C bonds would be: each CH3 group contributes one, each single bond between C's in the chain contributes one.

Let me try a different approach. The entire molecule is a chain with substituents, so each single bond between C atoms counts as a C-C bond.

We can count the number of single C-C bonds as (number of C atoms) minus 1 (since each additional bond reduces the count). Wait, no, because each C-C bond connects two C's. So the number of C-C bonds in a chain would be (number of C atoms) - 1, assuming it's a straight chain without any branches. But this molecule has branches, so that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each single bond between two C's is a C-C bond, and each double bond contributes one less C-C bond.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of C-C and C=C bonds.

The molecule has two C=C bonds (the two double bonds). The rest are single C-C bonds.

So for the entire molecule:

Number of C-C bonds = total number of single bonds between C's.

Each time two C's are connected by a single bond, that's a C-C.

So, let's count each single bond between C's.

In the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list each single bond between C's:

a. (CH3)2C connected to CH (but via double bond, so no single C-C here).
b. CH connected to CH2 (single bond) → 1.
c. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) (single bond) → 2.
d. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →3.
e. CH2 connected to CH →4.
f. CH connected to C in C=C (single bond) →5.
g. C in C=C connected to each CH3 → two single bonds (6 and 7).

Wait, but each CH3 is connected via a single bond to the C in the C=C. So that's two more.

So total C-C bonds: 7.

And the C=C bonds: 2.

Wait, that's 7 C-C and 2 C=C.

Additionally, the CH3 groups each have a C-C bond with the central C.

Wait, perhaps I should think that each CH3 contributes a C-C bond.

So in (CH3)2C=CH-, each CH3 is attached to the central C via a C-C bond.

So that's two more C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds would be 7 (from above) plus 2 → 9.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Every time two C's are connected by a single bond, it's a C-C.

So, each (CH3) group contributes a C-C bond to the central C.

The structure is:

C(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write each C with their connections.

But maybe it's taking too much time, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that I can count the number of each bond.

But given time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the data I have.

Assuming that I have 9 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, and the rest are C-H bonds.

Wait, but I need to count all the bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total number of each bond.

The molecule has:

- Each (CH3) group contributes 3 C-H bonds. Let me count how many CH3 groups are present.

Looking at the formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C: two CH3 groups → 2×3=6 C-H.
- CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups → 2×3=6 C-H.
- The other groups: 

Looking at each part:

- The CH in (CH3)2C=CH-: 1 C-H.
- The CH2 groups: each has two C-H → let's see how many CH2 groups we have.

In the chain:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the CH2 groups are:

- CH2 after the CH=.
- CH2 after CH(CH3).

So two CH2 groups → each contributes two C-H bonds → 2×2=4.

- The CH(CH3) group: 1 C-H (from CH) and the CH3 contributes 3 C-H → total 4.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the counts.

So let's try to count all C-H bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - Two CH3 → 6 C-H.
   - CH → 1 C-H.
   → 7.

2. CH2-:
   → 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-:
   → 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4.

4. CH2-:
   → 2.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:
   → 1 (from CH) + 6 (from two CH3) =7.

Total C-H bonds: 7 +2 +4 +2 +7 =22.

Which matches the earlier count of 22 H's → 22 C-H bonds.

So, number of C-H bonds:22.

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see. Each C in the chain (except the ends) is connected to two other C's, but each C-C bond is counted once.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C-C bond once.

The molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The structure can be thought of as a chain of C's with substituents.

Each single bond between C's is a C-C bond.

So, the chain goes: C - C - C - C - C - C - C - C.

Wait, no. Let me see:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → C1 connected to C2 via double bond.

2. C2 is connected to C3 (CH2) via single bond.

3. C3 connected to C4 (CH(CH3)) via single bond.

4. C4 connected to C5 (CH2) via single bond.

5. C5 connected to C6 (CH) via single bond.

6. C6 connected to C7 (C in C=C) via double bond.

But wait, C7 is connected to two CH3 groups via single bonds.

Hmm, perhaps the chain has 7 C's, but considering branches.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds can be found by:

Number of C-C single bonds = (number of C atoms) - number of double bonds - number of rings.

But the molecule is a chain, so number of C-C single bonds = 9 C's - 2 double bonds =7.

So 7 C-C bonds.

Plus, any C-C bonds from substituents.

Wait, each CH3 group is connected to a C via a single bond, so each contributes a C-C bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-, there are two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Similarly, in CH=C(CH3)2, the C is connected to two CH3 groups → two more C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds: 7 (from the chain) +2 (from first group) +2 (from last group) =11.

Wait, that's 11 C-C bonds.

But each CH3's C-C is only once. So perhaps that's correct.

So, C-C bonds:11.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:22.

Now, the bond energies:

Each C-C bond contributes 200 kJ/mol.

Each C=C bond contributes 300 kJ/mol.

Each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ/mol.

H-H bonds are not present, so no contribution.

So sum of bond energies in the compound:

= (number of C-C bonds × 200) + (number of C=C ×300) + (number of C-H ×400).

Plugging the numbers:

= (11 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400).

Calculating each part:

11 ×200 =2200.

2 ×300=600.

22 ×400=8800.

Sum: 2200 +600 =2800; 2800 +8800=11,600.

So sum of bond energies is 11,600 kJ/mol.

Now, the formula:

ΔHf° = [10,100] - [11,600] = 10,100 -11,600 = -1,500 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's a negative value. But looking at the options, the choices are all positive except option B, which is 67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because the options don't include -1500.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, the formula I used was:

ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2 ×100)] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the compound)].

But let me recheck the calculation.

m=9, n=22.

So m ×1000 =9000.

n/2 ×100 =11 ×100 =1100.

Sum: 9000+1100=10,100.

Σ bond energies: 11,600.

So 10,100 -11,600 = -1,500.

Hmm, negative ΔHf° would mean the molecule is more stable than its elements, which is possible, but looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is 10,100 + 11,600? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe I should subtract the bond energies of the compound from the sum, but perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the energies released when forming bonds in the products.

Alternatively, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum bond energies of product bonds].

But the product is the compound, and the reactants are C and H2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bonds formed in product]

So, bonds broken in reactants (C and H2) → these are the bonds in their standard states.

Bonds formed in product → bonds in the compound.

So, bonds broken:

- For C: each C comes from graphite, which has C-C bonds. So, each C requires breaking x C-C bonds. How many C-C bonds are in graphite per C atom? Graphite is a 2D lattice where each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So per C atom, there are 1.5 C-C bonds. So for m C atoms, the total C-C bonds broken would be (m × 1.5).

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of C as 1000 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom to form an atom in the gas phase. For graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared. So to atomize one mole of C, you need to break (3/2) moles of C-C bonds. So for m moles of C, it's (3/2) × m × bond energy of C-C.

Wait, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of C as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom in the compound comes from graphite, and the energy required to form one C atom is 1000 kJ/mol. So the total energy for C is m × 1000.

Similarly, each H atom comes from H2. So each H2 molecule has one bond. To get one H atom, you need to break half a bond. So for n H atoms, the energy is (n/2) × bond energy of H-H.

So the total energy for the reactants is (m × 1000) + (n/2 × 100).

The bonds formed in the product are all the bonds in the compound. The sum of the bond energies is 11,600 kJ/mol.

So ΔHf° = [m × 1000 + (n/2 ×100)] - [Σ (bond energies of product)].

Which, as earlier, gives 10,100 -11,600 = -1,500.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the count of C-C bonds. Let me recount.

If the molecule has 9 C's, and the number of C-C bonds is 9 - number of rings or double bonds. Since there are two double bonds, the number of C-C single bonds would be 9 - 2 - (number of rings). But the molecule is a chain, so no rings.

Wait, no, I think that approach doesn't account for branches. Alternatively, for a chain with all single bonds, the number of C-C bonds would be (number of C's) -1. But with double bonds, each double bond reduces the number of single bonds by one.

So in a chain with two double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds would be (number of C's) -1 - number of double bonds.

Number of C's:9.

So single C-C bonds:9-1-2=6.

But that's for a straight chain. However, our molecule has branches, so that approach might not be accurate.

Perhaps the correct way is to count each C-C bond individually.

Let me try again, perhaps I missed some.

Looking at the molecule:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group contributes a C-C bond to the central C.

So for the first (CH3)2C=CH- group:

- Two C-C bonds (from CH3 groups).
- One C=C bond (double bond between C and CH).

Then, the CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond → another C-C.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → another C-C.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 → another C-C.

CH2 connected to CH → another C-C.

CH connected to C in C=C → another C-C.

C in C=C connected to two CH3 groups → two more C-C bonds.

So, counting each:

1. (CH3)2C: 2 C-C (from CH3's).

2. C=CH: no single C-C, but the next bond is CH-CH2 → C-C (3).

3. CH2-CH(CH3): C-C (4).

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: C-C (5).

5. CH2-CH: C-C (6).

6. CH-C (in C=C): C-C (7).

7. C=C-CH3 (two times): two C-C bonds (8 and 9).

So total C-C bonds:9.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:22.

So the bond energies:

C-C:9 ×200=1800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total:1800 +600=2400; 2400 +8800= 11,200.

So the sum of bond energies in the compound is 11,200.

So ΔHf° = [10,100] - [11,200] = -1,100.

But the options don't have this. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around: sum of product bonds minus sum of reactant bonds. Because in the formation reaction, we're forming the compound from elements, releasing energy if the product bonds are stronger.

Wait, no. The formula for enthalpy of formation from bond energies is usually:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken) in reactants ] - [Σ (bonds formed) in products].

So that would be:

ΔHf° = [ (9 ×1000) + (22 ×50) ) ] - [ (9 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400) ) ]

Wait, wait, wait. Because for the H atoms, each H comes from H2, so each H requires breaking 0.5 H-H bonds. For 22 H atoms, that's 22/2=11 H-H bonds broken. Each H-H is 100 kJ/mol → 11 ×100=1100.

So the correct calculation is:

ΔHf° = [ (9 ×1000) + (22 ×50) ] - [ (9 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400) ]

Wait, 22 ×50 → because each H atom requires 0.5 ×100 →50 per H.

So:

Reactant bonds broken:

C:9 ×1000=9000.

H:22 ×50=1100.

Total:9000+1100=10,100.

Product bonds formed:

C-C:9 ×200=1800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8800.

Total product bonds:1800+600=2400; 2400+8800=11,200.

So ΔHf° =10,100 -11,200 = -1,100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I overcounted the C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Alternative approach: each single bond in the molecule is a C-C bond.

Let me consider the structure again:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH:
   - Each CH3 has a C-C bond to the central C → 2 bonds.
   - The central C is double-bonded to CH → no single bond here.

2. CH-CH2:
   - Single bond →1 C-C bond.

3. CH2-CH(CH3):
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2:
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

5. CH2-CH:
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

6. CH-C (in C=C):
   - Single bond →1 C-C.

7. C=C connected to CH3 groups:
   - Each CH3 has a C-C bond →2 C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds:

2 (from first group) +1 (CH-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3)-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH) +1 (CH-C) +2 (from CH3 groups) → total 9.

Yes, that's 9.

So with this, sum of product bonds:

9×200=1800; 2×300=600; 22×400=8800.

Total: 1800+600=2400; 2400+8800=11,200.

So 10,100 -11,200 = -1,100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the sum of the product bonds minus the sum of the reactant bonds.

Because when you form bonds, you release energy. So if the product bonds are stronger (have higher bond energies), the overall enthalpy of formation would be exothermic (negative).

But the formula I'm using is [reactant bonds broken] - [product bonds formed].

But if the product bonds are stronger, that would result in a negative ΔHf°, which is possible for stable compounds.

But the options don't have a negative value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using kJ/mol, but the options are in kJ/mol except option C and D, which are per gram.

Wait, the problem says "Calculate the enthalpy of formation of [compound]".

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

Wait, option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which is the same as the sum of the product bonds (11,200 kJ/mol). But my calculation was 10,100 -11,200 = -1,100.

But if the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation, which is the energy released when forming the compound from its elements, then perhaps the formula is the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of product bonds)] - [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds)].

But that would be 11,200 -10,100=1,100.

Which is positive.

But that would make option A (11,200) not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me check.

The standard formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products].

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants broken] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds formed].

Which is what I did earlier.

But according to that, I get -1,100.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Alternative approach: perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 8.

Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Each CH3 contributes a C-C bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: two C-C bonds.

CH-CH2: one.

CH2-CH(CH3): one.

CH(CH3)-CH2: one.

CH2-CH: one.

CH-C (in C=C): one.

C=C with two CH3 groups: two.

So that's 2+1+1+1+1+1+2=9.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the molecule as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which actually has 10 C atoms. Wait, let me recount the C's.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of C atoms.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is one C.

Let me list all C's:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - (CH3) → C1
   - (CH3) → C2
   - C (attached to both CH3) → C3
   - =CH- → C4.

2. CH2- → C5.

3. CH(CH3)- → C6.

4. CH2- → C7.

5. CH- → C8.

6. C=C(CH3)2: the C in the double bond is C9, and each CH3 is C10 and C11? No, wait: the (CH3)2 in the last part are attached to C9.

Wait, no, the structure is CH=C(CH3)2 → so the C in the double bond is C9, and each CH3 is attached to C9.

So the C's are C1 to C9.

Wait, that's 9 C's.

So I think the count is correct.

But I'm stuck because the calculation gives me -1,100, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as treating each C as coming from CO2 or H2O, but the problem states that the enthalpy of atomization is given, so that approach should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are given in reverse, like C-C is 300 and C=C is 200, but the problem states C-C is 200 and C=C is 300.

Wait, no, the problem says:

Bond energy of C-C =200 kJ/mol

Bond energy of C=C=300 kJ/mol

So I used them correctly.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. But the options include both.

Wait, the problem states, "calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2."

The given bond energies are per mole.

The options include per mole and per gram.

So perhaps I need to calculate the molar mass of the compound first.

The molecular formula is:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me determine the molecular formula.

Each C is counted as 9, as before.

Hydrogen: earlier count was 22.

So molecular formula is C9H22.

The molar mass would be (9 ×12) + (22 ×1) = 108 +22=130 g/mol.

So if the ΔHf° is -1,100 kJ/mol, then per gram would be -1,100 /130 ≈ -8.46 kJ/g.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the bond energies.

Wait, perhaps when the molecule is formed, the bonds formed are the sum of all the bonds, but perhaps the approach is different.

Another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as the sum of the energies of the bonds broken in the reactants minus the sum of the bonds formed in the product.

But perhaps I should calculate it as:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies of compound).

Which would be 10,100 -11,200= -1,100.

But again, options don't match.

Looking back at the options, option A is 11200 kJ/mol. Which is exactly the sum of the product bonds (11,200).

But that would be if the formula were ΔHf° = sum of product bonds - sum of reactant bonds → 11,200 -10,100=1,100.

But that's not option A.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong, and it's the sum of product bonds minus reactant bonds.

So 11,200 (product) -10,100 (reactant) =1,100.

But none of the options have 1,100.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed some H's.

Wait, let me recount the number of H's.

The molecular formula is C9H22.

So n=22 H's.

Earlier count of C-H bonds is 22. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the bonds are counted as the sum of all bonds in the molecule, but the formula for enthalpy of formation requires the sum of all bonds in the reactants minus sum of all bonds in the products.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-express the formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (reactant bonds)] - [Σ (product bonds)].

Which would be:

= [ (9 ×1000) + (22 ×50) ] - [ (9 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (22 ×400) ]

= [9000 + 1100] - [1800 +600 +8800]

=10,100 -11,200 = -1,100.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative idea: perhaps the formula is the sum of the bond energies of the product minus the sum of the bond energies of the reactants.

That would be 11,200 -10,100=1,100.

But that would imply that the formation is endothermic, which would mean the molecule is less stable than its elements. But many hydrocarbons have negative enthalpies of formation.

But since the options don't have 1,100, I'm stuck.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which matches the sum of the product bonds. So perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the bond energies of the product, which is option A.

But why would that be the case? Because the formula for enthalpy of formation isn't just the sum of product bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and they're asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, which would be the sum of all bond energies in the product.

In that case, the answer would be 11,200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But that's not the standard approach for enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has only 8 C-C bonds.

If that's the case, the sum would be:

8 ×200=1600.

2 ×300=600.

22 ×400=8800.

Total: 1600+600=2200 +8800=11,000.

Then ΔHf° =10,100 -11,000=-900.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

7×200=1400.

+600 (C=C) +8800 (C-H) = 1400+600=2000 +8800=10,800.

ΔHf°=10,100 -10,800 =-700.

Not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the number of each bond type and plug into the formula without worrying about the exact count.

But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 11200 kJ/mol, which matches the sum of the product bonds.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds, multiply by their respective bond energies, sum them, and that's the answer.

But why would that be the case? Because the options include 11200.

So perhaps the answer is A)11200.

But I'm not sure. However, based on the calculation, the sum of the product bonds is 11,200, which is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The compound has the molecular formula **C9H22**, and the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \left[ \text{Sum of bond energies of reactants} \right] - \left[ \text{Sum of bond energies of product bonds} \right]
\]

### Step 1: Count the number of atoms and bonds
- **Number of carbon atoms (C):** 9  
- **Number of hydrogen atoms (H):** 22  

#### Bond counts in the compound:
1. **C-C bonds:**  
   Each single bond between two carbon atoms is counted. The molecule has 9 C-C bonds.  
   \[
   \text{C-C bonds} = 9
   \]

2. **C=C bonds:**  
   The molecule has two double bonds between carbon atoms.  
   \[
   \text{C=C bonds} = 2
   \]

3. **C-H bonds:**  
   Each single bond between a carbon and a hydrogen atom is counted. The molecule has 22 C-H bonds.  
   \[
   \text{C-H bonds} = 22
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total bond energy of the product
Using the bond energies provided:
- **C-C bond energy:** 200 kJ/mol  
- **C=C bond energy:** 300 kJ/mol  
- **C-H bond energy:** 400 kJ/mol  

\[
\text{Total bond energy of product} = (9 \times 200) + (2 \times 300) + (22 \times 400)
\]
\[
= 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11,200 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the reactants
The reactants are carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H2).  
- **Enthalpy of atomization of C:** 1000 kJ/mol  
- **Bond energy of H-H:** 100 kJ/mol  

For **C9H22**:
- **Energy to break C-C bonds in graphite:**  
  Each carbon atom in graphite is bonded to three others, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol per carbon atom.  
  \[
  \text{Energy for C} = 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

- **Energy to break H-H bonds in H2:**  
  Each H2 molecule has one H-H bond. For 22 hydrogen atoms, 11 H-H bonds are broken.  
  \[
  \text{Energy for H} = \frac{22}{2} \times 100 = 11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

- **Total energy for reactants:**  
  \[
  9000 + 1100 = 10,100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Sum of reactant bonds} - \text{Sum of product bonds}
\]
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 10,100 - 11,200 = -1,100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
The calculated enthalpy of formation is **-1,100 kJ/mol**, but none of the options match this value. However, the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds is **11,200 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to **Option A**. It appears the question may be asking for the total bond energy of the product rather than the enthalpy of formation.

### Final Answer:
The total bond energy of the product is **11,200 kJ/mol**, which matches **Option A**.
