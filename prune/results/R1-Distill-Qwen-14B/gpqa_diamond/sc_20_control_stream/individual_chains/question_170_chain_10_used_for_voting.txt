Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Oh right, I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. Wait, wait, no, actually, the spin operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_y, right?

But wait, the state vector is given as (3i, 4). Hmm. So the spin state is a two-component vector. Let me write that down. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_y, which is ψ† σ_y ψ. So I need to compute ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ, and then multiply that by ħ/2.

Wait, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ is [3i, 4]^T, so ψ† is [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, wait, no: the conjugate transpose. So for ψ = [3i, 4], the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is 4. So ψ† is [-3, 4].

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. The vector ψ is (3i, 4)^T. So the conjugate transpose would be a row vector where each element is the complex conjugate of the original, in reverse order. So ψ is [ 3i; 4 ], so ψ† is [ 3i*, 4* ] as a row vector. 3i* is -3i (since complex conjugate of 3i is -3i?), wait no: wait, 3i is a complex number. Its complex conjugate is -3i, because 3i = 3 * e^{i π/2}, so the conjugate is 3 e^{-i π/2} = -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The vector ψ is given as (3i, 4). So ψ is a column vector with top element 3i and bottom 4. The conjugate transpose, ψ†, is a row vector where each element is the complex conjugate. So (3i)* is -3i, and 4* is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, ψ† σ_y is the product of this row vector with the 2x2 σ_y matrix.

Let me write it out:

ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ]

σ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So ψ† σ_y would be:

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, 3i * (-i) is -3i^2. But wait, no: wait, the multiplication is [ -3i, 4 ] times the columns of σ_y.

Wait, let me compute each element.

The result of ψ† σ_y will be a row vector of two elements. Let me compute each component.

First component (for the first element of the row vector):

= (-3i) * (0) + 4 * (i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second component (for the second element):

= (-3i) * (-i) + 4 * (0) = (3i^2) + 0.

Wait, because (-3i) * (-i) = 3 i^2. And i^2 is -1, so this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we need to multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4]. So the product ψ† σ_y ψ is [4i, -3] * [3i; 4].

Let me compute that:

(4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12 i² + (-12).

i² is -1, so 12*(-1) is -12. So this becomes -12 -12 = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24. But wait, wait, the actual expectation value is (ħ/2) times this, because S_y = ħ/2 σ_y.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨σ_y⟩. So the expectation of σ_y is the scalar we just calculated, which is -24. So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24).

Wait, wait a minute, wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Because I'm getting a negative value, but let's check each step.

Wait, when I computed ψ† σ_y, I got [4i, -3].

Then, when multiplying by ψ, which is [3i, 4]^T, it's [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

So 4i * 3i = 12 i² = 12 * (-1) = -12.

Then -3 * 4 = -12.

Adding them gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation of σ_y is -24. Then, since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, the expectation is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ ) /2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see: option A is -12 hbar/25. Hmm. Because I must have made a mistake somewhere because the denominator is 25 in the options. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the normalization of the state vector.

Wait a second, the state vector isn't necessarily normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first. Because the expectation value calculations should take the norm into account.

Oh right, because the expectation value is ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩, but wait no, in the case of spin-1/2 systems, the state is usually a unit vector because spin states are normalized. But in the problem, the state is given as (3i,4), so I should check if it's normalized.

Wait, the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the state isn't normalized. So the actual state is (3i,4) / 5. Because the norm is 5, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5)^T.

So that's an error in my earlier calculation. I forgot to normalize the state before computing the expectation value. So I need to adjust for that.

So I should compute the expectation value as (⟨ψ | σ_y | ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ | ψ⟩), where ψ is the given vector.

Wait, no, because the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, but if the state isn't normalized, that's okay because O is an operator and the expectation is (⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ | ψ⟩). But wait, in the case of spin-1/2 systems, the state is usually a unit vector, but in this problem, it's given as a non-normalized vector. So I need to compute the expectation value correctly.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the state is given as (3i,4). So the norm is sqrt(|3i|^2 + |4|^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) =5. So the normalized state is (3i/5,4/5).

So I should have ψ as (3i/5,4/5)^T. So let's redo the calculations with this normalized state.

So ψ = [3i/5; 4/5].

ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3/5, 4/5 ].

So ψ† σ_y is [ -3/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by σ_y.

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

Compute each element:

First element: (-3/5)(0) + (4/5)(i) → 0 + (4i/5) = 4i/5.

Second element: (-3/5)(-i) + (4/5)(0) → (3i/5) + 0 = 3i/5.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i/5, 3i/5].

Now, multiply this with ψ, which is [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

So the product is [4i/5 * 3i/5 + 3i/5 * 4/5 ].

Wait, wait, no. Let me rephrase. The result of ψ† σ_y is a row vector [4i/5, 3i/5]. Multiply this by ψ, which is a column vector [3i/5; 4/5].

So the product is:

(4i/5)(3i/5) + (3i/5)(4/5).

Compute each term:

First term: (4i/5)(3i/5) = 12 i² /25 = 12 (-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (3i/5)(4/5) = 12 i /25.

Adding these together: -12/25 + 12i/25.

Wait, but that's a complex number. Hmm. However, the expectation value of an observable should be real, because observables have real expectation values. This suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating ψ† σ_y.

Wait, let me recalculate ψ† σ_y.

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

So σ_y can also be written as:

Row 1: 0, -i.

Row 2: i, 0.

So when I compute ψ† σ_y, which is [ -3/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by σ_y.

So,

First element:

(-3/5) * 0 + (4/5) * i = 0 + (4i)/5.

Second element:

(-3/5) * (-i) + (4/5) * 0 = (3i)/5 + 0.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i/5, 3i/5].

Wait, then when I multiply this row vector by ψ, which is [3i/5; 4/5], I get:

(4i/5) * (3i/5) + (3i/5) * (4/5).

Calculate each term:

First term: (4i * 3i) / (5*5) = (12 i²) /25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (3i *4) / (5*5) = (12i)/25.

So the sum is (-12/25) + (12i/25) = (-12 +12i)/25.

Wait, that's a complex number. That can't be right because S_y is an observable, so its expectation value should be real. I must have messed up something.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and because we're working with the expectation value, perhaps I should re-express this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, the correct way to compute ψ† σ_y ψ is to compute the matrix product correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the components.

So ψ is [ a, b ]^T, where a =3i/5, b=4/5.

The expectation value of σ_y is (a* b - b* a). Because σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so σ_y | ψ is [ -i b, i a ]^T.

Then, ψ† σ_y ψ is a* (-i b) + b* (i a) ).

Wait, let me compute that.

a = 3i/5 → a* = -3i/5.

b =4/5 → b* =4/5.

So:

a* (-i b) = (-3i/5) * (-i)(4/5) = (3i/5)(i)(4/5) → 3i *i=3i²= -3.

So (3i/5)(i)(4/5) = (3i^2 *4)/(5*5) )= (3*(-1)*4)/25 = (-12)/25.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each term:

a* (-i b) = (-3i/5) * (-i) * (4/5) = (3i * i) *4/(5*5) (because (-3i/5) * (-i) = 3i * i /5, which is 3i² /5, which is 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5. Then multiplied by 4/5 gives (-3/5)(4/5) = (-12)/25.)

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it as:

a* is (-3i/5), b is (4/5).

So a* (-i b) = (-3i/5) * (-i) * (4/5) = (3i^2 * 4)/(5*5) = 3*(-1)*4/(25) )= -12/25.

Similarly, the second term: b* (i a) = (4/5) * i * (3i/5).

So (4/5) * i * (3i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) )= (12*(-1))/25 )= -12/25.

So adding the two terms: (-12/25) + (-12/25) )= (-24)/25.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was a complex number. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the method.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of σ_y is (a* b - b* a)/(a* a + b* b) ?

No, wait, because σ_y is a Hermitian operator, so its expectation value should be real. But in my earlier calculation, I ended up with a complex number, which must have been a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it the correct way. Let me write the matrix elements.

Compute ψ† σ_y ψ:

ψ† is [ a*, b* ].

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

ψ is [ a, b ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ = a* * 0 * a + a* * (-i) * b + b* * i * a + b* *0 * b.

Which simplifies to:

0 + (-i) a* b + i b* a + 0 = (-i a* b + i b* a).

Factor out i: i (b* a - a* b).

But (b* a - a* b) is 2i Im(a* b).

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, it's better to compute each term.

Wait, perhaps using a and b as 3i/5 and 4/5.

So let's compute a* = (3i/5)* = -3i/5.

b* = (4/5)* =4/5.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-i) a* b + i b* a.

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-i) a* b = (-i) * (-3i/5) * (4/5) = (-i) * [ (-3i)(4) ) / (5*5) ].

Wait, (-3i)(4) is -12i. So (-i) * (-12i)/(25) = (12 i²)/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: i b* a = i * (4/5) * (3i/5) = i * (12 i) /25 )= (12 i²)/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

So adding these two terms: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24/25.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I computed it without normalization, I got -24. But now, with normalization, it's -24/25.

So then, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by this, so (-24/25) * (ħ/2) )= (-12 ħ )/25.

So the expectation value is -12 ħ /25.

Looking back at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25, which matches.

Wait, but wait: the earlier method when I didn't normalize gave me -24 ħ, but that's because I forgot to normalize the state. So the correct answer should be option A: -12 hbar/25.

So the answer is A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4)^T \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalize the state vector**:  
   The norm of \( \psi \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \frac{1}{5}(3i, 4)^T = \left(\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)^T.
   \]

2. **Spin operator**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Expectation value formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)**:  
   First, write \( \psi = \left(\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)^T \) and \( \psi^\dagger = \left(-\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right) \).  
   The matrix product \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \) is:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3i}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Now multiply by \( \psi \):  
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3i}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \frac{4}{5}.
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{12i^2}{25} - \frac{12i}{25}.
   \]  
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \):  
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{-12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

5. **Expectation value of \( S_y \)**:  
   Substitute into \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final answer**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
