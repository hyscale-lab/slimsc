Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are we talking about here?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which ones are mandatory.

First, some basic concepts. Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the laws of nature. Effective theories like SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they are effective for, which is the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects certain symmetries, so SMEFT should as well.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of them. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must transform correctly under the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry is a must. That means option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. I think that Poincare symmetry includes the idea that the laws of physics are the same everywhere and for all observers moving at constant velocity. But wait, in the context of effective field theories, do we require Poincare symmetry explicitly, or is it automatically maintained if Lorentz symmetry is there? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetries, but SMEFT is a field theory, so operators are local, which would respect translation invariance. Hmm. So if Lorentz is already a symmetry, and translation invariance is part of Poincare, then Poincare symmetry is automatically respected. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, is also a must. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Then, CP symmetry. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general, right? Because there's the famous CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't need to enforce it either. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 isn't a must; operators could violate CP if the new physics allows it.

What about CPT symmetry? Hmm, I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must have CPT symmetry. So if the SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, then it must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together: all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Wait, but wait, is Poincare symmetry a separate symmetry or is it included in Lorentz symmetry? Because Lorentz symmetry plus translation invariance gives Poincare. So if the theory already respects Lorentz and translation invariance (which it does as a field theory), then Poincare is automatically satisfied. So SMEFT must have operators that are Poincare-invariant, which they are because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant field theory.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Do the operators in SMEFT have to all respect Poincare symmetry? Because in SMEFT, you can have operators of various dimensions. But for a theory to be Poincare-invariant, it must be translation invariant. Since SMEFT is a field theory, which is local, operators are constructed from fields and their derivatives, so the theory automatically respects translation invariance. Therefore, Poincare symmetry is already enforced if Lorentz and translation are okay. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, Lorentz, and CPT.

So the correct options are 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but the options are: option C is 1,2,4. So that's the right answer. But wait the original options are:

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would be C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform correctly under the Lorentz group. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently respects translation invariance, and Lorentz symmetry is already required. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry is automatically satisfied in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model, which SMEFT extends, does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in the CKM matrix. Consequently, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: All Lorentz-invariant theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry due to the CPT theorem in quantum field theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
