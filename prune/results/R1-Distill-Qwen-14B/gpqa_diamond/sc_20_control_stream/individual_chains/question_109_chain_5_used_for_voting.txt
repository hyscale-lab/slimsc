Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles they emit. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's some condition on the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I remember that isospin is related to the symmetry of the nucleons. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Oh right, for two nucleons, the isospin T can be either 0 or 1. If T=0, they are in an antisymmetric state, which is like a singlet. If T=1, it's a triplet. But here, the final state has T=0, so the two nucleons are in a singlet state.

The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about transitions from 1S0 to various other states plus a particle, which I think is the emitted X. The options are A, B, C, D, each ending with p, p, f, s. Wait, what do those letters mean? Oh, I think p is a particle with orbital angular momentum l=1 (like a photon), s might be l=0, and f is l=3. D and P are orbital angular momentum letters. D is L=2, P is L=1, S is L=0.

Wait, in the problem statement, the particle X's intrinsic parity is -1. I remember that the parity of a particle is given by (-1)^(L+1), where L is the orbital angular momentum. So if X has parity -1, then (-1)^(L+1) = -1. Let's compute that. Taking logs: (-1)^(L+1) = -1 = (-1)^1. So L+1 must be odd. So L+1 is 1 mod 2, meaning L is even. So L can be 0, 2, 4, etc. But since these are partial waves, the possible Ls are 0,1,2,3, etc. So possible L for X is 0, 2, 4, etc. So X has even orbital angular momentum. So in each of the options, the emitted particle has a certain L which we can get from the letter.

Wait, each option is of the form 1S0 -> something + something. For example, option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So the emitted particle is p, which I think refers to a proton. But wait, no, in this context, the letter after the plus is probably the orbital angular momentum state. Because the options are about the partial wave of X, which is the emitted particle. So the 'p' in option A is probably the orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 (since P is l=1). Wait, no, D is L=2, P is L=1, S is L=0, F is L=3, etc. So in option A, the particle X is in a D state with L=2? Or is that the orbital part of the transition?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in the options, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is indicated by the letter. So in option A, 1S0 ->7D1 + p. So the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l=1 (since the letter is D, no, wait D is L=2. Wait, letters go S (0), P (1), D (2), F (3), etc. So the state after the plus is the orbital part of X, I think.

Wait, the options are given as transitions, so the state after the arrow is the final state, which is the NN state plus the emitted particle X. The X's state is given by the lowercase letter.

So for example, option A: 1S0 ->7D1 + p. So the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l=1 (P state?), because the letter is p. Wait, no, the part after the plus is the orbital angular momentum's letter. So in option A, X is emitted in a P state (l=1), because the last part is 'p'. Similarly, option C has 'f' which is l=3.

Wait, but earlier we determined that X has intrinsic parity -1, which requires X's orbital angular momentum l to be even. So l must be even. So X's orbital angular momentum must be 0, 2, 4, etc.

So looking at the options:

A: X has orbital l=1 (p state). So parity would be (-1)^(1+1) = 1. But X's parity is given as -1, so this is not allowed. So A is a possibility for the wrong option.

B: X's orbital is 'p' again, l=1. Same problem, parity would be +1. So this would violate the condition.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, the parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^(l+1). Because for a particle, the parity is (-1)^(L+1), where L is the orbital angular momentum.

So for X to have parity -1:

(-1)^(l +1) = -1

Which implies l +1 is odd. So l must be even.

So l can be 0, 2, 4, etc.

So any option where X's l is odd (like p=1, f=3, etc.) would lead to X's parity being +1, which contradicts the given -1. So those options are not allowed. So options A, B, and C have X in p, p, and f states, which are l=1, l=1, l=3. All odd, which would give X parity +1. Only option D has X in s state, which is l=0. So option D is the only one where X's parity is -1. So the other options (A, B, C) all have X with parity +1, which is incorrect. So they are not allowed.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So if the problem is about which transition is forbidden because of parity or angular momentum conservation, the options which don't satisfy X's parity are forbidden.

But wait, the problem says that the correct options must satisfy conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So the ones that don't satisfy the parity condition would be invalid.

So the question is, which of the options is not permitted? So for each option, check if X's parity is -1.

Option A: X is p. l=1. Parity would be (-1)^(1+1)=1. So parity +1. Not allowed. So this is forbidden.

Same logic applies to B and C. Only D has X as s, l=0. Parity is (-1)^(0+1)= -1. So parity is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be the options where X's parity is not -1. So options A, B, C are all forbidden? But the question says which is not permitted, implying one of them is allowed, others not.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again.

The question says: the NN system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is fixed as -1. So any process that emits X must have X's parity as -1. So any process where X's parity isn't -1 is forbidden. So in the options, the X must have parity -1, which requires X's orbital angular momentum l to be even (as earlier).

So any option where X's l is odd (e.g., p, which is l=1) would have X's parity wrong. So those transitions are forbidden.

So looking at the options:

A) X is p → l=1 → parity +1 → forbidden.

B) X is p → l=1 → forbidden.

C) X is f → l=3 → parity (-1)^(3+1)=1 → forbidden.

D) X is s → l=0 → parity (-1)^(0+1)= -1 → allowed.

So the only allowed option is D. So the others are forbidden. The question is which partial wave is not permitted, so options A, B, C are forbidden, but the options are A, B, C, D. So the correct answer is the forbidden one, so which one is not allowed. The question asks which is not permitted, so it's any of A, B, C.

Wait, but the question says which is not permitted. So the correct answer would be the one that doesn't meet the parity condition. So the incorrect options are A, B, C. But the question provides four options, and only one is correct. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the conservation of angular momentum as well. So the initial state's total angular momentum must match the final state's total angular momentum.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So for 1S0, S=0 (since it's S state), so 2S+1=1. The L is 0 because it's S. So the total angular momentum J is 0.

The emitted particle X has angular momentum l. So the initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state consists of the NN state (with J_NN) and the X particle (with l_X). The total J_final must equal J_initial, so J_NN + l_X must have the same parity or something? Wait, no, angular momentum must be conserved, so vectorially. But for each partial wave, the orbital angular momentum L of the emission must match.

Alternatively, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is part of the process. So the initial NN state has L=0 (1S0). When the NN emits X, the orbital angular momentum of that emission must be L. So the initial orbital angular momentum is 0, and after emission, the NN has orbital angular momentum L_NN and the X has orbital angular momentum l. So the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN + l.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The initial state's orbital angular momentum is L_initial = 0 (since it's 1S0). The process is emitting a particle X, which takes away some orbital angular momentum. The NN system after emission will have some orbital angular momentum L_NN, and the emitted X will have orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. So L_initial = L_NN - l? No, that's not quite right. Actually, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is part of the system, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN plus l.

But wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is 0. So 0 = L_NN + l. So L_NN = -l. But angular momentum can't be negative. Oh, no, because L and l are quantum numbers, and their sum must be a possible angular momentum. So the total L after emission (L_NN + l) can't be negative. So perhaps the correct way is that the initial L is 0, and after emission, the sum of the NN's L and X's l must be zero. So L_NN + l = 0. So L_NN = -l. But since L and l are non-negative integers, the only possibility is that l=0 and L_NN=0, or l=0 and L_NN=0.

Wait, that can't be right because in the problem, the emitted X can have different l's. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is the same as the orbital angular momentum carried away. So the initial state has L=0. The process involves emission via an orbital angular momentum L, so the emitted X carries away L, and the NN system is left with L_NN = 0 +/- L, but considering angular momentum addition.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the emission process. The initial orbital angular momentum is zero. When the system emits a particle with orbital angular momentum l, the NN system must have orbital angular momentum L_NN = l. Because the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN + l_emission. Wait, no, in the center of mass frame, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is relative. So perhaps the correct condition is that the orbital angular momentum carried by X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the emission process. So the initial state L_initial is 0. After emission, the NN has L_NN, and X has l. So the conservation would require that L_initial = L_NN + l. But since L_initial is zero, that implies L_NN + l = 0. But angular momentum can't be negative, so the only possibility is L_NN = l = 0.

Wait, that would mean that only emission with l=0 is allowed, but that's not the case because the options have X emitted in various l's. So I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X is part of the transition. So the initial state has L_initial = 0, and the emission involves a transition where X carries away orbital angular momentum l. So the final state's orbital angular momentum for the NN system would be L_NN = l. Because the system's L_initial is zero, and the X carries away l, so L_NN = l.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the system's orbital angular momentum can't just change to match the emitted particle's. Let me think in terms of angular momentum addition. The initial state has L_initial =0. The emission process involves a transition where the NN system goes from L_initial=0 to L_NN, and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l. So the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN + l.

But the total must equal the initial, so L_initial = L_NN + l. Since L_initial is 0, L_NN + l =0. So L_NN = -l. But since both L_NN and l are non-negative, the only solution is L_NN = l =0. So this would imply that only l=0 is allowed, which contradicts the options given. So I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the orbital angular momentum of the emission process. The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN system after emission has orbital angular momentum L_NN. So the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN + l. But since the initial L is zero, the total after must also be zero, so L_NN + l =0. But that again implies L_NN=l=0.

But in the options, the emitted X has l=1, l=1, l=3, l=0 for options A, B, C, D respectively. So only option D would satisfy L_NN=0. Let me check what each option's L_NN is.

Wait, the options are the final NN states. For each option, the first part is the initial state (1S0), and the next part is the final state, which is something like 7D1. So the 7D1 would have L=2 (since D is L=2). So L_NN for each option is:

Option A: 7D1 → L_NN=2.

Option B: 3S1 → L_NN=0.

Option C: 3D3 → L_NN=2.

Option D: 3P0 → L_NN=1.

So for each option, the emitted X's l is:

Option A: X is p → l=1.

So according to the previous condition (L_NN + l =0), this would require 2 +1=3, which doesn't equal zero. But that's impossible, so this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the X is the same as the orbital angular momentum in the transition, so the total orbital angular momentum of the system after emission is the same as before, which was zero.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. The final state consists of the NN system with orbital angular momentum L_NN and the X with orbital angular momentum l. The sum of these must equal zero. So L_NN + l =0. But since L and l are non-negative, the only solution is L_NN = l =0. So only option D (X has l=0) is allowed. So for the other options, X's l is non-zero, which would require L_NN to be negative, which isn't possible. Hence, those options are forbidden.

But earlier, I thought that X's parity must be -1, which requires l even, so l=0,2,4,... So for the other options (A, B, C), their X's l is odd, which makes X's parity +1, which is incorrect. So both angular momentum and parity conditions must be considered.

So putting it all together:

1. X's parity must be -1 → l must be even (0,2,4,...). So options A, B, C have l=1,1,3 (all odd) → parity +1. So these are forbidden because X's parity is wrong.

2. Angular momentum conservation: L_initial=0. So L_NN + l =0 → l = -L_NN. But since l and L_NN are non-negative, this requires L_NN=0 and l=0. So only option D with l=0 is allowed.

So the options A, B, C are forbidden because both parity and angular momentum are not conserved. But since the question asks which is not permitted, the answer would be any of A, B, or C. But looking at the options, only one option is allowed (D). So the question must be which one is not allowed, so the answer is one of A, B, C.

Wait, but the options are four, and the correct answer is the one that's not allowed. So perhaps in the options, the only one allowed is D, so the others are not permitted. The question asks which partial wave is not permitted, so the answer is any of A, B, or C.

But the options are given as A, B, C, D. The correct answer would be one of them. Let me see the options again:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p → X has l=1 → parity +1 → forbidden.

B) 1S0 →3S1 + p → X l=1 → parity +1 → forbidden.

C) 1S0 →3D3 + f → X l=3 → parity (-1)^(3+1)=1 → forbidden.

D) 1S0 →3P0 + s → X l=0 → parity (-1)^(0+1)=-1 → allowed.

So the correct answer is D is allowed. The others are forbidden. The question asks which is not permitted, so the answer is A, B, or C. But the options are given as what's not permitted. So the options are presented as A, B, C, D, with the question asking which is not permitted. So the answer should be any of A, B, C. But the options are each a different possibility, so the correct answer is one of them. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I should check the angular momentum condition for each option. Because even if X's parity is correct, the angular momentum must be conserved.

Option D: X has l=0. So L_NN + l =0 → L_NN=0. The final NN state is 3P0. The term is 3P0. Let's see, the term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. Here, L=1 (P), so the orbital angular momentum is 1. So L_NN is 1. So L_NN + l =1 +0=1, which isn't zero. That's a problem. So option D violates angular momentum conservation. That's a problem.

Wait, that contradicts. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I think I was wrong in how I applied the angular momentum conservation. The initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial =0. When the NN system emits a particle X with orbital angular momentum l, the final NN system must have orbital angular momentum L_NN such that L_initial = L_NN + l. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the process of emission, the orbital angular momentum is part of the emitted particle. Alternatively, the total orbital angular momentum after the emission must equal the initial, which is zero. So L_initial = L_NN + l → 0 = L_NN + l.

But L_NN and l are non-negative, so the only solution is L_NN=0 and l=0. So the only allowed option is when l=0 and L_NN=0. So in the options:

Option D: X has l=0, so L_NN must be 0. The final state of the NN is 3P0. The term here is 3P0. The 3 indicates the spin multiplicity, so 2S+1=3 → S=1. The L is P, which is L=1. So orbital angular momentum L_NN is 1. So L_NN=1, l=0 → 1+0=1≠0. So this violates angular momentum conservation. So option D is also forbidden.

Wait, that's a problem. So none of the options satisfy both the parity and angular momentum conditions? That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the angular momentum part. Maybe when the NN system emits a particle X, the orbital angular momentum of the emission is l. So the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0. After emission, the NN has L_NN, and the X has l. So the total orbital angular momentum is L_NN + l. But since the initial state has L=0, the sum must be zero. So L_NN + l =0. Which again implies L_NN=0 and l=0. So only option D's X has l=0, but the NN's L_NN in option D is 1 (3P0: L=1). So that's a problem. So option D is not allowed either.

So all options are forbidden? That can't be, because the question must have an answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how the orbital angular momentum is distributed. Let me think again. The initial state has the NN in L=0. When they emit a particle with orbital angular momentum l, the final NN state must have L_NN such that L_initial = L_NN ± l, considering the possible angular momentum addition.

Wait, no, because the orbital angular momentum is a vector. So the initial state has L_initial=0. The emitted particle takes away orbital angular momentum l, so the final state's NN has L_NN = l. Because L_initial =0, so L_initial + l → L_NN = l.

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean L_NN = l, which for a given X's l, the NN's L would have to be l. So for option D, X has l=0 → L_NN=0. But the final state in D is 3P0, which has L=1, so that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the transition. So the initial state has L=0. The emission process has orbital angular momentum l, so the final state's L_NN would be l. Therefore, L_NN = l.

So in each option, the final L_NN is the same as the emitted X's l.

So for each option:

Option A: X is p → l=1 → L_NN=1. The final state is 7D1 → L=2. So 1≠2 → forbidden.

Option B: X p → l=1 → L_NN=1. Final state is 3S1 → L=0. So 1≠0 → forbidden.

Option C: X f → l=3 → L_NN=3. Final state is 3D3 → L=2. 3≠2 → forbidden.

Option D: X s → l=0 → L_NN=0. Final state is 3P0 → L=1 → 0≠1 → forbidden.

Wait, but that can't be right because all options are forbidden. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Perhaps I should consider that the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is the same as the change in the NN's orbital angular momentum. So the initial L is 0, the final L_NN is L_NN, and the X carries away l, so L_initial + l = L_NN. But since L_initial is 0, L_NN = l.

Which again leads to the same problem as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) with the orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission (L_NN). Maybe the correct way is that the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN's orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN. So the initial state's L is 0. So the total after emission is L_NN + l. But since initial L is 0, L_NN + l must be zero. So L_NN = -l. But both are non-negative, so only l=0 and L_NN=0 is allowed. So only option D's X has l=0, but in option D, the NN's L_NN is 1. So that's a problem.

This suggests that none of the options are allowed, which can't be the case. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the initial state's angular momentum is J=0 (since it's 1S0). The emitted particle X has angular momentum j_X, which includes its spin and orbital angular momentum. The final state's NN has angular momentum J_NN. So the conservation requires J_initial = J_NN + j_X. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the Pauli exclusion condition given in the problem. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T=0.

So T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L must have opposite parity. So if L is even, S must be odd, and vice versa.

Let's evaluate each option's final NN state:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (D), so L=2 even. S would be (2S+1)=7 → S=(7-1)/2=3 → S=3, which is odd. So S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). Sum S+L =3+2=5 → odd. So S+L =1 mod 2. So T=0= (1) +1 mod 2 → 0=0. So condition holds.

So option A's final state satisfies the Pauli condition.

Wait, same for each option:

Option A: Final state 7D1 → L=2 even, 2S+1=7 → S=3 → S odd. So S+L=3+2=5 → 1 mod 2. So T= S + L +1 mod 2 → (1)+1=0 mod 2. So condition holds.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 even. 2S+1=3 → S=1 → odd. S+L=1+0=1 → 1 mod 2. So T=0=1+1=0. Condition holds.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2 even. 2S+1=3 → S=1. S+L=1+2=3 → 1 mod 2. So T=0 holds.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 (P) odd. 2S+1=3 → S=1 (odd). S+L =1 +1=2 → 0 mod 2. So T= S+L +1 mod 2 → 0 +1 =1 mod 2. But the problem states T=0. So condition fails for option D.

So option D's final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. Therefore, option D is forbidden.

So summarizing:

- All options must have X's parity correct (l even) and satisfy the Pauli condition.

Looking back at X's parity:

Only options where X's l is even are allowed. So options:

A: l=1 → no.

B: l=1 → no.

C: l=3 → no.

D: l=0 → yes, parity is -1.

But for the Pauli condition, only option D fails, while the others satisfy it. But wait, earlier analysis says that only option D has correct X's parity, but it fails the Pauli condition. So option D is forbidden because it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, but that can't be because the Pauli condition must be satisfied. So the only option that has X's parity correct (D) has a final state that violates the Pauli condition. So D is forbidden.

So the other options (A,B,C) have X's parity incorrect, which is a more fundamental issue. So the correct answer is the one where X's parity is incorrect, which are A, B, C.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer must be one of them. But all of A, B, C fail because their X's l is odd, leading to X's parity +1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the parity of X.

X's parity is given as -1.

Parity of X is (-1)^(l +1). So:

For X to have parity -1:

(-1)^(l+1) = -1 → (-1)^(l+1) = (-1)^1 → l+1 must be odd → l must be even.

So l must be even: 0,2,4,...

So any option where X's l is odd is forbidden because X's parity would be +1.

So the options:

A) X is p → l=1 → forbidden.

B) X is p → l=1 → forbidden.

C) X is f → l=3 → forbidden.

D) X is s → l=0 → allowed.

So the only allowed option is D, but we saw that D's final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition applies only when the emitted particle is a boson. But X is a nucleon? No, X is a particle emitted, which could be a meson or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the Pauli exclusion applies to identical particles. In this case, the NN are identical fermions, so their state must be antisymmetric under exchange. But the problem states that the condition must be satisfied.

Wait, perhaps the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, for each final state, we must check if this holds.

In the given problem, the final state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So for each option's final state, check S and L:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 even, S=3 (from 2S+1=7). S=3 is odd. So S+L=3+2=5 → 1 mod 2. So condition holds.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 even, S=1 (odd). S+L=1 →1 mod 2. Condition holds.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2, S=1. S+L=3 →1 mod 2. Condition holds.

Option D:3P0 → L=1, S=1. S+L=2 →0 mod 2. 0=0+1 →0=1? No. So condition doesn't hold.

So only option D's final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

But X's parity is only correct in option D. So in that case, option D is forbidden by the Pauli condition, despite X's parity being correct. But the other options are forbidden by X's parity.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave refers to the emitted X's orbital angular momentum. So the correct answer would be the option where X's l is even, but the Pauli condition is violated. But all other options have X's l odd (forbidden by parity), so they are not permitted.

So the answer must be one of A, B, or C because their X's l is odd, making X's parity incorrect. So among the options, which one is not permitted due to parity.

But the problem also states that the Pauli condition must be satisfied. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the option where X's parity is correct, and the Pauli condition is satisfied.

Only option D has X's parity correct, but it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So the correct answer is D is forbidden.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is D.

Wait, but that can't be because the other options have X's parity wrong, making them forbidden. So I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me try to structure this:

Each option must satisfy two conditions:

1. X's parity is -1 → l must be even.

2. Final NN state must satisfy T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

So for each option:

Option A: X l=1 → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option B: X l=1 → forbidden.

Option C: X l=3 → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option D: X l=0 → parity -1 → allowed.

But in option D, the final NN state is 3P0. So L=1, S=1. So S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So T= S+L +1 =0 +1=1 mod 2. But T=0 is required. So this doesn't hold. So option D is forbidden.

Thus, all options are forbidden, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the Pauli condition.

Wait, the problem says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

But in the problem statement, the final state has T=0. So:

0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So for each final state, check S and L.

Option A: L=2 (even), S=3 (odd). S + L =5 →1 mod 2 → condition holds.

Option B: L=0 (even), S=1 (odd). S+L=1 →1 mod 2 → holds.

Option C: L=2 (even), S=1 (odd). S+L=3 →1 mod 2 → holds.

Option D: L=1 (odd), S=1 (odd). S+L=2 →0 mod 2 → condition fails.

So only option D's final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

But X's parity is correct only in option D. So in D, X's parity is okay, but the Pauli condition is violated. So D is forbidden.

The other options have X's parity incorrect, making them forbidden as well. But the question is which is not permitted. So perhaps the answer is D, because it's the only option that meets the parity condition but fails the Pauli condition, while the others fail both.

But the problem says that the final state must satisfy T=0, so any option where the Pauli condition is not met is forbidden.

So the correct answer is the option where the final state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So among the options, only D is forbidden because it doesn't meet the Pauli condition, despite X's parity being correct.

But the options are labeled as which partial wave (emitted X's l) is not permitted. So the answer is D, as it's the only option where X's l=0 (allowed parity) but the Pauli condition is not met, making it forbidden.

But wait, the other options have X's l odd, which makes X's parity incorrect, which is a more fundamental issue. So the options A, B, C are forbidden because their X's parity is +1, which is wrong.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave refers to the emitted X's l. So the forbidden ones are A, B, C (l=1,1,3) as their X's parity is wrong. Only D is allowed, but it's forbidden by the Pauli condition.

So the answer is the option where X's l is even but the Pauli condition is not met (D), but the other options are forbidden by X's parity.

But the question is which is not permitted, so the correct answer is D, as it's the only one that meets X's parity but fails the Pauli condition.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option.

Only option D has X's l=0, which gives X's parity correct. But the final state's Pauli condition is not met. So the answer is D is not permitted because it violates the Pauli condition.

But the other options have X's parity incorrect, so they're forbidden regardless of the Pauli condition.

So the answer is D is not permitted because it fails the Pauli condition, despite correct parity. But the question is to choose which partial wave is not allowed, so the correct letter is D.

Wait, but the question states that the emission must conserve both angular momentum and parity.

So the correct approach is to check for each option:

1. X's parity must be -1 → l even.

2. Angular momentum must be conserved: L_initial (0) must equal L_NN + l.

3. Pauli condition must be met: T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

So for each option:

Option A:

- X l=1 → parity +1 → violates parity → forbidden.

Option B:

- X l=1 → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option C:

- X l=3 → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option D:

- X l=0 → parity -1 → allowed.

Now check angular momentum:

- L_initial =0.

- L_NN (from 3P0) is 1.

- So 0 = 1 + 0 → 1=0 → impossible. So angular momentum not conserved → forbidden.

Thus, all options are forbidden either by parity or angular momentum or Pauli condition.

But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to find which option's angular momentum and parity are both conserved and the Pauli condition is met.

Only option D has X's l=0, which gives parity correct. But in option D, the NN's L=1. So L_initial=0 → 0 = L_NN + l → 0=1+0 → no. So angular momentum not conserved. Thus, option D is forbidden.

The other options have X's l odd → parity incorrect → forbidden.

Thus, the correct answer is D is forbidden because angular momentum isn't conserved, despite X's parity being correct.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the correct answer must satisfy both angular momentum and parity conservation. So the options that don't meet either are forbidden.

So the correct answer is D is forbidden because it violates angular momentum conservation, despite correct parity.

But the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted, so the answer is D.

Wait, but all the options are forbidden, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the angular momentum part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is l, and the NN's orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN. So L_initial = L_NN + l.

But L_initial=0 → L_NN = -l. But l can't be negative, so L_NN must equal l, and L_initial =0 → L_NN = l, but that would require L_NN = l, which for option D, L_NN=1 and l=0 → 1=0 → impossible.

Thus, only option D has X's parity correct but fails angular momentum conservation.

So the answer is D is forbidden.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \(-1\). The conditions to be satisfied are:

1. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of \( X \) is given as \(-1\). For a particle with orbital angular momentum \( l \), the parity is \((-1)^{l+1}\). Setting \((-1)^{l+1} = -1\), it follows that \( l+1 \) must be odd, so \( l \) must be even (\( l = 0, 2, 4, \dots \)).

2. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial state has orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{initial}} = 0 \). After the emission, the total orbital angular momentum of the system must remain zero. If the emitted particle \( X \) has orbital angular momentum \( l \), the final NN state must have orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{NN}} = -l \). Since \( L_{\text{NN}} \) and \( l \) are non-negative, this implies \( L_{\text{NN}} = l = 0 \). Thus, the only allowed value for \( l \) is \( 0 \).

3. **Pauli Condition**: The problem states that \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). For the final NN state with \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this simplifies to \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). The spin \( S_{\text{NN}} \) is determined from the term symbol \((2S+1)L_J\), and \( L_{\text{NN}} \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

### Analysis of Each Option

#### **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**
- \( X \) has \( l = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
- Parity of \( X \): \((-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{1+1} = +1\), which is incorrect (must be \(-1\)).
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

#### **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**
- \( X \) has \( l = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
- Parity of \( X \): \((-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{1+1} = +1\), which is incorrect (must be \(-1\)).
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**
- \( X \) has \( l = 3 \) (denoted by \( f \)).
- Parity of \( X \): \((-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{3+1} = +1\), which is incorrect (must be \(-1\)).
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**
- \( X \) has \( l = 0 \) (denoted by \( s \)).
- Parity of \( X \): \((-1)^{l+1} = (-1)^{0+1} = -1\), which is correct.
- **Angular Momentum Conservation**: \( L_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 3P0 \)), and \( l = 0 \). The condition \( L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{NN}} + l \) fails because \( 0 \neq 1 + 0 \).
- **Pauli Condition**: For the final state \( 3P0 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) and \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)). Thus, \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is \( 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). This does not satisfy \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).
- **Conclusion**: Forbidden due to angular momentum and Pauli condition violations.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies \( X \)'s parity is \( D \), but it fails both angular momentum and Pauli condition requirements. The other options are forbidden due to parity violations. Therefore, the partial wave that is not permitted is:

**Answer: D**
