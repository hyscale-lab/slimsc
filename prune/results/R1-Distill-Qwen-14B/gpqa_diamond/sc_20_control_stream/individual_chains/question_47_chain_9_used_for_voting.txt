Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. So that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. Let me think about possible functional groups. The IR data might help.

The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Wait, but amines have N-H stretches, but amides as well. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Because amides have lower carbonyl frequencies, like around 1650 cm-1, so 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. But looking at the options, I don't see any ketones. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3, so an ethoxy group. Because the triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So ethoxy is a possibility.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet might be from an NH group, but wait, what else? Or maybe an OCH2 group. But in an ethoxy group, the protons are usually more upfield, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group, like in an amide. But in that case, amide protons usually are more around 2-3 ppm, but some can be broader. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group adjacent to something else.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like, for example, in an ester group, like OCO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2 ppm and a quartet at around 4.1 ppm. But in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, so maybe it's not the ethyl ester. Or perhaps it's part of another group.

Wait, another thought. The quartet at 4.5 ppm, 2H. Maybe that's the CH2 next to an oxygen. For example, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So that quartet might be from the OCH2 group. Let me think about the ethyl ester: the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The -OCH2- would be split into a quartet because each H is adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So the quartet would be around 4.1 ppm, but here it's 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, looking at the options. Let's see the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the benzamide would have the CONH2 group. The ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So in this case, the phenyl group is attached to N, with an ethoxy group at position 4. So the structure would be HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formamide would have a HCO-N- link.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So this would be an amino group (NH2) attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and a propionyl group attached as an ester or amide? Wait, propionate is an acid, so perhaps as an ester, like CH2CH2COO-O-R. Or, in this case, if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it's probably an amide. Because if it's an ester, the formula would have an O. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check each option.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate would be COO-O-R. So ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So structure is OCO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, with an NH2 group at position 4.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formulas for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Ethoxy is adding OCH2CH3, so total would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's one more H. Is that possible? Maybe if I'm missing something.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So the phenyl group is 4-ethoxy. So the formula would be C8H9NO2 (phenyl is C6H5, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, formamide is HCON). Wait, let's compute. The phenyl (C6H5) plus ethoxy (C2H5O) would be C8H7O. Formamide is HCONH- attached to the phenyl. So the formula would be C8H7NO2. But given we have C9H11NO2, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think again. Benzene ring is C6H5. Then, the substituents: formamide group is HCONR2. So the substituent would be HCONH- attached to the benzene. Wait no, wait. The substituent is OCH2CH3 at position 4, and the formamide group is attached to the benzene via the N. So the structure is HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the molecule is C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). Wait, maybe not. Let me count carbons: benzene (6 C), ethoxy (2 C), formamide has 1 C (HCO-), so total is 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 C. That matches C9. Hydrogen: benzene ring has 4 H (since 4-ethoxy would have one substituent, so -OCH2CH3 at position 4. So the ring has 4 H. Then, the ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2 H each, so 2*2=4, but OCH2CH3 has 5 H in total? Wait, OCH2CH3 has 3 H on the CH2 and 2 on the CH3? No, OCH2CH3 is ethoxy: CH2CH3-O- attached. So the ethoxy has 5 H in total (2 on the OCH2, 3 on the CH3). Wait no: OCH2CH3 has two CH2 groups? No, it's OCH2CH3, which is O connected to CH2, which is connected to CH3. So OCH2CH3 has 2 H on the CH2 and 3 H on the CH3. So total of 5 H. The formamide part is HCONH-R. Wait, no. The formamide is HCONH-(phenyl). So the substituent is HCONH- attached to the benzene. So the HCONH- group would have how many H? The H in HCONH- is one, and the NH is another. So that's two H? Or perhaps more.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. So adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C9H12NO2? Because benzamide is C7H7NO, and adding an OCH2CH3 would add 2 C, 5 H, and O. So C7 +2=9, H7 +5=12, N remains, O becomes 2 (since benzamide has one O, and ethoxy adds another). So formula C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A is C9H12NO2. Doesn't match. So perhaps not the correct option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So when attached to the benzene, it's HCONH-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5 (benzene) + OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) + HCONH. So C6 + C2 + C1 = C9. H: benzene has 4 H (since attached to two groups: ethoxy and formamide), ethoxy has 5 H, formamide has HCONH which has 2 H (NH2?), wait. Let me count:

Benzene ring: 4 H (as it's substituted at two positions: 4 and the formamide? Wait, the formamide is attached to the N, which is on the benzene. So the benzene is substituted with OCH2CH3 at position 4 and the formamide group at position... Well, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions. So the benzene has two substituents: OCH2CH3 and NHCOH. So the ring would have 4 H. The OCH2CH3 contributes 5 H (2 from CH2, 3 from CH3). The HCONH- group: HCONH would have the H from HCO and the NH. So that's 1 (from HCO) + 2 (from NH) = 3 H. So total H would be 4 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +3 (formamide) = 12 H. Plus any others? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. So option B would have C9H12NO2, which doesn't match. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, propionate can be either an acid or an ester. If it's an ester, then the structure would be CH2CH2COO-O-R. But the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which suggests that the propionate is attached via the amino group. Wait, but amines can form amides but not esters. So perhaps it's a propionamide? Or maybe it's an ester with the amino group. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's compute for each option.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Phenyl group is C6H5. The propionate group is CH2CH2COO-. So the formula would be C6H5 (5 H on the ring?), plus propionate (3 C, 5 H: from CH2CH2COO- would be CH2CH2COO- which is OOC-CH2CH2-). Wait, but the structure would be the amino group attached to the ring and the propionate as an ester or amide. If it's an amide, then the structure would be NH2-C6H4-CONH-CH2CH2COOH? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an amino ester. Wait, but esters are usually from carboxylic acids. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is OOC-CH2CH2-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, that would be the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid with a propyl group? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is the propionate ester of 4-aminophenol. But that might have a different formula. I'm getting stuck here, maybe I should move on and come back.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be OCO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, which also has an NH2 group at position 4. So the formula would be: benzene (C6H5) + OCOOCH2CH3 (which is C3H5O2) + NH2 (which is C0H2N). Wait, let me count: C6 + C3 (from OCOOCH2CH3) = C9. H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: OCOOCH2CH3 and NH2). The ethyl ester group OCOOCH2CH3 has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H). The NH2 group has 2 H. So total H: 4 (ring) +5 (ester) +2 (NH2) = 11 H. Nitrogen: 1 (from NH2). O: 3? Let me see: OCOO has 3 O, but wait, the formula is O2. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

So for option D: C6H5 (C6) + OCOOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (N1H2). So C:6+3=9, H:5 (from ester) + 2 (NH2) +4 (ring)= 11, N:1, O:3? Wait, but the formula is O2. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the benzoate ester structure is OCOO-R, where R is ethyl. So benzoate is C6H5COO-. Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoate would have the COO- group attached to the benzene at position 4, along with the NH2 group. So the structure is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene, which also has NH2 at position 4.

So the formula of the ester group OCOOCH2CH3 is: OCOO has 2 O, and the ethyl is C2H5. So the entire group is O2, C3, H5. The benzene ring contributes 6 C, and the substituents would be O2, C3, H5, NH2 (which is N1, H2). So total C:6 (benzene) +3 (ester) =9. H: benzene ring has 4 H (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2), plus the ester contributes 5 H (ethyl), plus the NH2 contributes 2 H. So 4+5+2=11 H. N:1. O: the benzene has the O from the ester group (2 O). So the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So option D is a possible candidate.

Now, looking back at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely the CH3 of an ethyl group. So maybe the ethyl in the ester group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, what could this be? If it's an ethyl ester, then the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, but in this case, it's 4.5 ppm as a quartet. Wait, but here, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. So perhaps the OCH2 is at 4.5. Let me think: the ethyl ester group OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2 ppm. But in our data, the triplet is at 1.2, which matches. The quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's not an ethyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group.

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. The NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). For a quartet, each H has coupling with two neighboring H's. So perhaps a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. For example, in an ester group, the OCH2 would be a quartet if coupled with the adjacent CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in an amide structure.

Wait, let me think about the structure of each option, especially D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

That structure would have:

- Benzene ring with NH2 and OCOOEt groups at position 4.

- The ester group: OCO-OCH2CH3.

So the NMR should show:

The OCH2CH3 group: the CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches the data. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher. Hmm, that doesn't match. Also, where is the NH2 group in the NMR? Well, the NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the data has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, 2H. But NH2 would be expected to be a broad peak, but where? In the case of an amine, the NH2 protons are typically around 1-5 ppm, but in an aromatic amine (like aniline), the NH2 can be a broad peak, but it's usually more downfield.

Wait, in the NMR data, the broad peak is at 4.0 ppm, 2H. That might not fit an NH2 group. Because in aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless it's a substituted amine where the protons are more upfield. But 4.0 is a bit upfield for NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group.

Wait, the NMR data also has 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because the doublets with 2H each indicate two sets of equivalent protons, which is typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituents would be para to each other. So in option D, the NH2 and OCOOEt groups are in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating for two H. So that fits.

So if the aromatic H are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, that could mean that the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester) and an electron-donating group (like the NH2). But the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, which would de-shield the para protons, making them appear downfield. The NH2 is an activating group, which would shield the ortho and para protons, but in this case, the substituents are para to each other, so the ring protons would be in two sets of doublets.

So in the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be the OCH2 group. Because in the ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1, but perhaps in this case, it's shifted upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's not the ethyl group. Or perhaps the OCH2 is split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in an ethyl group, the OCH2 would be adjacent to the CH3, so the coupling would be with the two H on the CH2 and the three on the CH3. Wait no, the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3 via the single bond. So each H on OCH2 would be seeing the two H on the adjacent CH2. So that's a quartet, but in reality, the OCH2 is next to the CH3, which has three H. So the coupling for OCH2 would be with the CH3, which is three H, so the OCH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no, the OCH2 is connected to the CH3 via a single bond, so the OCH2 group would be a quartet. The CH3 would be a triplet because it's connected to the OCH2 with two H. So the OCH2 is a quartet around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 is a triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches the data given. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher than expected. Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is deshielded more, causing a downfield shift. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from another group. Looking back, the 1H NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), and a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H). That could correspond to an ethyl group, but the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group attached to another oxygen. Or maybe it's a different group altogether.

Wait, looking at option D, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 at para. The COOEt group would have the OCH2CH3 as a triplet and quartet. So the triplet is at 1.2 (the CH3), quartet at 4.1 (OCH2). But the data shows quartet at 4.5, which is higher. Maybe the OCH2 is more deshielded, perhaps because of the proximity to the amino group. Or perhaps the integration is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from another group, like a methylene adjacent to another group. Let's think about the other options.

Looking back at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide has a HCO- group attached to N, which is attached to the benzene. The ethoxy is at the para position. So the formamide group would have a CH2 group somewhere?

Wait, no. The formamide is HCONH-Ph. So the HCONH- would have a HCO- attached to NHPh. So the HCO would be a carbonyl, with the NH attached to the benzene. So the NH would be part of the formamide group. The NMR would show the NH protons as a broad signal. But in the data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm, but in formamide, the NH would be a broad peak, but where? Typically, in formamide derivatives, the NH protons are around 8-9 ppm, but this is more downfield. Alternatively, perhaps the NH is involved in hydrogen bonding, causing it to shift downfield. But the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from the ethoxy group. Wait, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would typically be around 4.0 ppm as a quartet, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR of ethyl esters. For example, ethyl acetate has the OCH2CH3 as a quartet at ~4.1 ppm and the CH3 as a triplet at 1.2 ppm. So in our data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Could that be due to some neighboring group effect, like being next to an electronegative group? Or perhaps it's not an ethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a propionate ester. But the molecular formula is C9, so if it's a propyl group, that would add more carbons. Hmm, but the options given don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a methylene group adjacent to an amide. Wait, in an amide, the alpha protons (next to the carbonyl) would be around 4.5 ppm. But in the options, only option A is an amide.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the NMR would have the ethoxy triplet at 1.2, quartet near 4.0. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm.

Wait, the benzamide would have an NH2 group. The NH2 protons would typically be broad. In the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H), but in the case of NH2, it's usually two protons as a broad peak. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But benzamide's NH2 is usually around 6-8 ppm, but maybe in this case it's somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up in the NMR, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought. If the quartet at 4.5 ppm is from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps it's the OCH2 group from an ester or another oxygen-containing group. So, if the structure is an ester, like option D, but the OCH2 is appearing at 4.5 instead of 4.1, perhaps it's due to some substituent effect. Or maybe there's another group causing a splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about the NMR data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → likely ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → maybe NH2, but at 4.0, which is a bit upfield.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, likely OCH2.

7.0 and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H each) → aromatic protons.

So, the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2, triplet at 1.2 is CH3. So the ethyl group is present, but how does that fit into the structure?

In option D, the ethyl is part of the ester group. So the OCH2 would be at around 4.1. But in the data, it's 4.5. So perhaps the OCH2 is shifted downfield. Because the ester is attached to an amino group, which is electron-withdrawing. Wait, amino groups are electron-donating, so perhaps they cause some shielding. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the coupling constants. The quartet at 4.5 has a certain splitting. The triplet at 1.2 would have a coupling constant around 7 Hz (from ethyl groups), which is typical. The quartet's coupling constant would be similar. So that seems consistent.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the carbonyl in the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester or possibly an amide. But earlier I thought that 1720 is higher than typical amide I bands. So more likely an ester.

So the compound has an ester group. Looking at the options, options D and B are the only ones with ester or amide groups.

Wait, option D is an ester. Option B is a formamide, which is an amide.

So if the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester, then options D and perhaps another. Option B has a formamide, which would typically have a lower carbonyl peak, around 1650. So maybe option D is more likely.

So putting it all together:

- IR: 1720 cm-1 → ester.

- NMR:

  - 1.20 (t, 3H) → CH3 of ethyl.

  - 4.5 (q, 2H) → OCH2 of ethyl ester.

  - 4.0 (bs, 2H) → possibly NH2? But in option D, the NH2 is aromatic amine, which might be broad but perhaps not seen in the NMR due to exchange broadening. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of another group.

Wait, in option D, the structure is OCOOCH2CH3 attached to the benzene, with NH2 at position 4. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. Ring amines (like aniline) typically have NH2 protons that are broad and can appear as singlets or doublets. But in the case of aniline, the NH2 protons are usually around 6-7 ppm, but in the data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm. That seems off. So perhaps the NH2 isn't showing up in the NMR, or perhaps it's not present.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the option analysis. Let me check again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OCO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which has an NH2 group at position 4.

So the NH2 would be part of the aromatic ring. In aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are typically broad, but their chemical shifts can vary. In this case, the NH2 is adjacent to the ester group. Maybe the NH2 is deshielded and appears around 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet, but that's unusual. Usually, aniline NH2 is around 6-8 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So maybe the 4.0 ppm peak isn't the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from something else. Wait, what about the ethyl group? The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5, as per the data. So that matches. The CH3 is a triplet at 1.2, which matches. So the ethyl group is accounted for.

The 4.0 ppm broad signal is 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's an exchange broadened peak, like NH2, but shifted. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 from another group.

Wait, looking back, let's think about the aromatic protons. The data shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So in option D, the substituents are OCOOEt and NH2. 

In the case of 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1 (assuming numbering). So the ring would have two substituents in para positions. The aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. The substituent with the amino group is activating, so the ortho and para protons would be more shielded. The ester is deactivating, so its ortho and para protons would be deshielded. So the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would correspond to the protons adjacent to the amino group (more shielded) and the protons adjacent to the ester (less shielded, more downfield). That fits.

So, putting this together, the ethyl ester part matches the NMR data except for the OCH2 quartet's position. The aromatic protons match the expected pattern. The IR suggests an ester, which fits option D. The NH2 might not show up in the NMR if it's under exchange broadening, or perhaps it's another group.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Option D: 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester has the formula C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches.

So, the possible answer is D.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me compare with the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. The formamide's carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1 in IR, which doesn't match the strong band at 1720. So the ester is more likely.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If it's an ester, the structure would be OOC-CH2CH2-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, that's not correct because the ester would be from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's a propionamide, the structure would be NH2-C6H4-CONH-CH2CH2CH3. That would have an amide group, and the carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1. The IR here is 1720, which suggests it's an ester, not an amide. So option C is less likely.

So, after considering all options, the data seems to fit option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound C9H11NO2 is to be identified using the provided spectroscopic data:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Molecular Formula**: C9H11NO2 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (6 carbons), an ethoxy group (2 carbons), and additional functional groups.

2. **IR Data**:
   - **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These bands are consistent with N-H stretches, likely from an amine or amide group.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong band indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide. The higher wavenumber suggests an ester rather than an amide.

3. **1H NMR Data**:
   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (OCH2CH3).
   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from NH2 protons or another group.
   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from the OCH2 group of an ethyl ester.
   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

4. **Spectroscopic Consistency**:
   - The **1720 cm⁻¹ IR band** strongly suggests an ester group.
   - The **NMR data** matches the expected splitting and integration for an ethyl ester group (triplet at 1.20 ppm for CH3 and quartet at 4.5 ppm for OCH2).
   - The aromatic protons (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: This is an amide, and the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ does not match amides, which typically show lower wavenumbers (~1650 cm⁻¹). Additionally, the NMR data does not fully align with this structure.
   - **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: This is also an amide, and the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is inconsistent with amides. The NMR data does not support this structure either.
   - **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: If this were an ester, the carbonyl IR band would match, but the molecular formula and NMR data do not align with this structure. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm does not fit well with this option.
   - **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: This is an ester, and the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches. The NMR data aligns well:
     - The triplet at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the CH3 of the ethyl ester.
     - The quartet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.
     - The doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.
     - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could correspond to the NH2 group, which may be shifted due to exchange broadening.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data and molecular formula are consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. 

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. So that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. Let me think about possible functional groups. The IR data might help.

The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Wait, but amines have N-H stretches, but amides as well. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Because amides have lower carbonyl frequencies, like around 1650 cm-1, so 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. But looking at the options, I don't see any ketones. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3, so an ethoxy group. Because the triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So ethoxy is a possibility.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet might be from an NH group, but wait, what else? Or maybe an OCH2 group. But in an ethoxy group, the protons are usually more upfield, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group, like in an amide. But in that case, amide protons usually are more around 2-3 ppm, but some can be broader. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group adjacent to something else.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like, for example, in an ester group, like OCO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2 ppm and a quartet at around 4.1 ppm. But in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, so maybe it's not the ethyl ester. Or perhaps it's part of another group.

Wait, another thought. The quartet at 4.5 ppm, 2H. Maybe that's the CH2 next to an oxygen. For example, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So that quartet might be from the OCH2 group. Let me think about the ethyl ester: the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The -OCH2- would be split into a quartet because each H is adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So the quartet would be around 4.1 ppm, but here it's 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, looking at the options. Let's see the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the benzamide would have the CONH2 group. The ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So in this case, the phenyl group is attached to N, with an ethoxy group at position 4. So the structure would be HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formamide would have a HCO-N- link.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So this would be an amino group (NH2) attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and a propionyl group attached as an ester or amide? Wait, propionate is an acid, so perhaps as an ester, like CH2CH2COO-O-R. Or, in this case, if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it's probably an amide. Because if it's an ester, the formula would have an O. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check each option.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate would be COO-O-R. So ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So structure is OCO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, with an NH2 group at position 4.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formulas for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Ethoxy is adding OCH2CH3, so total would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's one more H. Is that possible? Maybe if I'm missing something.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So the phenyl group is 4-ethoxy. So the formula would be C8H9NO2 (phenyl is C6H5, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, formamide is HCON). Wait, let's compute. The phenyl (C6H5) plus ethoxy (C2H5O) would be C8H7O. Formamide is HCONH- attached to the phenyl. So the formula would be C8H7NO2. But given we have C9H11NO2, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think again. Benzene ring is C6H5. Then, the substituents: formamide group is HCONR2. So the substituent would be HCONH- attached to the benzene. Wait no, wait. The substituent is OCH2CH3 at position 4, and the formamide group is attached to the benzene via the N. So the structure is HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the molecule is C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). Wait, maybe not. Let me count carbons: benzene (6 C), ethoxy (2 C), formamide has 1 C (HCO-), so total is 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 C. That matches C9. Hydrogen: benzene ring has 4 H (since 4-ethoxy would have one substituent, so -OCH2CH3 at position 4. So the ring has 4 H. Then, the ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2 H each, so 2*2=4, but OCH2CH3 has 5 H in total? Wait, OCH2CH3 has 3 H on the CH2 and 2 on the CH3? No, OCH2CH3 is ethoxy: CH2CH3-O- attached. So the ethoxy has 5 H in total (2 on the OCH2, 3 on the CH3). Wait no: OCH2CH3 has two CH2 groups? No, it's OCH2CH3, which is O connected to CH2, which is connected to CH3. So OCH2CH3 has 2 H on the CH2 and 3 H on the CH3. So total of 5 H. The formamide part is HCONH-R. Wait, no. The formamide is HCONH-(phenyl). So the substituent is HCONH- attached to the benzene. So the HCONH- group would have how many H? The H in HCONH- is one, and the NH is another. So that's two H? Or perhaps more.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. So adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C9H12NO2? Because benzamide is C7H7NO, and adding an OCH2CH3 would add 2 C, 5 H, and O. So C7 +2=9, H7 +5=12, N remains, O becomes 2 (since benzamide has one O, and ethoxy adds another). So formula C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A is C9H12NO2. Doesn't match. So perhaps not the correct option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So when attached to the benzene, it's HCONH-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5 (benzene) + OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) + HCONH. So C6 + C2 + C1 = C9. H: benzene has 4 H (since attached to two groups: ethoxy and formamide), ethoxy has 5 H, formamide has HCONH which has 2 H (NH2?), wait. Let me count:

Benzene ring: 4 H (as it's substituted at two positions: 4 and the formamide? Wait, the formamide is attached to the N, which is on the benzene. So the benzene is substituted with OCH2CH3 at position 4 and the formamide group at position... Well, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions. So the benzene has two substituents: OCH2CH3 and NHCOH. So the ring would have 4 H. The OCH2CH3 contributes 5 H (2 from CH2, 3 from CH3). The HCONH- group: HCONH would have the H from HCO and the NH. So that's 1 (from HCO) + 2 (from NH) = 3 H. So total H would be 4 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +3 (formamide) = 12 H. Plus any others? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. So option B would have C9H12NO2, which doesn't match. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, propionate can be either an acid or an ester. If it's an ester, then the structure would be CH2CH2COO-O-R. But the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which suggests that the propionate is attached via the amino group. Wait, but amines can form amides but not esters. So perhaps it's a propionamide? Or maybe it's an ester with the amino group. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's compute for each option.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Phenyl group is C6H5. The propionate group is CH2CH2COO-. So the formula would be C6H5 (5 H on the ring?), plus propionate (3 C, 5 H: from CH2CH2COO- would be CH2CH2COO- which is OOC-CH2CH2-). Wait, but the structure would be the amino group attached to the ring and the propionate as an ester or amide. If it's an amide, then the structure would be NH2-C6H4-CONH-CH2CH2COOH? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an amino ester. Wait, but esters are usually from carboxylic acids. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is OOC-CH2CH2-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, that would be the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid with a propyl group? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is the propionate ester of 4-aminophenol. But that might have a different formula. I'm getting stuck here, maybe I should move on and come back.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be OCO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, which also has an NH2 group at position 4. So the formula would be: benzene (C6H5) + OCOOCH2CH3 (which is C3H5O2) + NH2 (which is C0H2N). Wait, let me count: C6 + C3 (from OCOOCH2CH3) = C9. H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: OCOOCH2CH3 and NH2). The ethyl ester group OCOOCH2CH3 has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H). The NH2 group has 2 H. So total H: 4 (ring) +5 (ester) +2 (NH2) = 11 H. Nitrogen: 1 (from NH2). O: 3? Let me see: OCOO has 3 O, but wait, the formula is O2. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

So for option D: C6H5 (C6) + OCOOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (N1H2). So C:6+3=9, H:5 (from ester) + 2 (NH2) +4 (ring)= 11, N:1, O:3? Wait, but the formula is O2. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the benzoate ester structure is OCOO-R, where R is ethyl. So benzoate is C6H5COO-. Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoate would have the COO- group attached to the benzene at position 4, along with the NH2 group. So the structure is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene, which also has NH2 at position 4.

So the formula of the ester group OCOOCH2CH3 is: OCOO has 2 O, and the ethyl is C2H5. So the entire group is O2, C3, H5. The benzene ring contributes 6 C, and the substituents would be O2, C3, H5, NH2 (which is N1, H2). So total C:6 (benzene) +3 (ester) =9. H: benzene ring has 4 H (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2), plus the ester contributes 5 H (ethyl), plus the NH2 contributes 2 H. So 4+5+2=11 H. N:1. O: the benzene has the O from the ester group (2 O). So the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So option D is a possible candidate.

Now, looking back at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely the CH3 of an ethyl group. So maybe the ethyl in the ester group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, what could this be? If it's an ethyl ester, then the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, but in this case, it's 4.5 ppm as a quartet. Wait, but here, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. So perhaps the OCH2 is at 4.5. Let me think: the ethyl ester group OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2 ppm. But in our data, the triplet is at 1.2, which matches. The quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's not an ethyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group.

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. The NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). For a quartet, each H has coupling with two neighboring H's. So perhaps a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. For example, in an ester group, the OCH2 would be a quartet if coupled with the adjacent CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in an amide structure.

Wait, let me think about the structure of each option, especially D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

That structure would have:

- Benzene ring with NH2 and OCOOEt groups at position 4.

- The ester group: OCO-OCH2CH3.

So the NMR should show:

The OCH2CH3 group: the CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches the data. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher. Hmm, that doesn't match. Also, where is the NH2 group in the NMR? Well, the NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the data has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, 2H. But NH2 would be expected to be a broad peak, but where? In the case of an amine, the NH2 protons are typically around 1-5 ppm, but in an aromatic amine (like aniline), the NH2 can be a broad peak, but it's usually more downfield.

Wait, in the NMR data, the broad peak is at 4.0 ppm, 2H. That might not fit an NH2 group. Because in aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless it's a substituted amine where the protons are more upfield. But 4.0 is a bit upfield for NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group.

Wait, the NMR data also has 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because the doublets with 2H each indicate two sets of equivalent protons, which is typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituents would be para to each other. So in option D, the NH2 and OCOOEt groups are in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating for two H. So that fits.

So if the aromatic H are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, that could mean that the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester) and an electron-donating group (like the NH2). But the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, which would de-shield the para protons, making them appear downfield. The NH2 is an activating group, which would shield the ortho and para protons, but in this case, the substituents are para to each other, so the ring protons would be in two sets of doublets.

So in the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be the OCH2 group. Because in the ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1, but perhaps in this case, it's shifted upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's not the ethyl group. Or perhaps the OCH2 is split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in an ethyl group, the OCH2 would be adjacent to the CH3, so the coupling would be with the two H on the CH2 and the three on the CH3. Wait no, the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3 via the single bond. So each H on OCH2 would be seeing the two H on the adjacent CH2. So that's a quartet, but in reality, the OCH2 is next to the CH3, which has three H. So the coupling for OCH2 would be with the CH3, which is three H, so the OCH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no, the OCH2 is connected to the CH3 via a single bond, so the OCH2 group would be a quartet. The CH3 would be a triplet because it's connected to the OCH2 with two H. So the OCH2 is a quartet around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 is a triplet around 1.2 ppm, which matches the data given. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher than expected. Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is deshielded more, causing a downfield shift. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from another group. Looking back, the 1H NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), and a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H). That could correspond to an ethyl group, but the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group attached to another oxygen. Or maybe it's a different group altogether.

Wait, looking at option D, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O=C(O-)OCH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 at para. The COOEt group would have the OCH2CH3 as a triplet and quartet. So the triplet is at 1.2 (the CH3), quartet at 4.1 (OCH2). But the data shows quartet at 4.5, which is higher. Maybe the OCH2 is more deshielded, perhaps because of the proximity to the amino group. Or perhaps the integration is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from another group, like a methylene adjacent to another group. Let's think about the other options.

Looking back at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide has a HCO- group attached to N, which is attached to the benzene. The ethoxy is at the para position. So the formamide group would have a CH2 group somewhere?

Wait, no. The formamide is HCONH-Ph. So the HCONH- would have a HCO- attached to NHPh. So the HCO would be a carbonyl, with the NH attached to the benzene. So the NH would be part of the formamide group. The NMR would show the NH protons as a broad signal. But in the data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm (2H). Hmm, but in formamide, the NH would be a broad peak, but where? Typically, in formamide derivatives, the NH protons are around 8-9 ppm, but this is more downfield. Alternatively, perhaps the NH is involved in hydrogen bonding, causing it to shift downfield. But the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from the ethoxy group. Wait, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would typically be around 4.0 ppm as a quartet, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR of ethyl esters. For example, ethyl acetate has the OCH2CH3 as a quartet at ~4.1 ppm and the CH3 as a triplet at 1.2 ppm. So in our data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Could that be due to some neighboring group effect, like being next to an electronegative group? Or perhaps it's not an ethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a propionate ester. But the molecular formula is C9, so if it's a propyl group, that would add more carbons. Hmm, but the options given don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a methylene group adjacent to an amide. Wait, in an amide, the alpha protons (next to the carbonyl) would be around 4.5 ppm. But in the options, only option A is an amide.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the NMR would have the ethoxy triplet at 1.2, quartet near 4.0. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm.

Wait, the benzamide would have an NH2 group. The NH2 protons would typically be broad. In the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H), but in the case of NH2, it's usually two protons as a broad peak. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But benzamide's NH2 is usually around 6-8 ppm, but maybe in this case it's somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up in the NMR, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought. If the quartet at 4.5 ppm is from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps it's the OCH2 group from an ester or another oxygen-containing group. So, if the structure is an ester, like option D, but the OCH2 is appearing at 4.5 instead of 4.1, perhaps it's due to some substituent effect. Or maybe there's another group causing a splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about the NMR data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → likely ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → maybe NH2, but at 4.0, which is a bit upfield.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, likely OCH2.

7.0 and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H each) → aromatic protons.

So, the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2, triplet at 1.2 is CH3. So the ethyl group is present, but how does that fit into the structure?

In option D, the ethyl is part of the ester group. So the OCH2 would be at around 4.1. But in the data, it's 4.5. So perhaps the OCH2 is shifted downfield. Because the ester is attached to an amino group, which is electron-withdrawing. Wait, amino groups are electron-donating, so perhaps they cause some shielding. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the coupling constants. The quartet at 4.5 has a certain splitting. The triplet at 1.2 would have a coupling constant around 7 Hz (from ethyl groups), which is typical. The quartet's coupling constant would be similar. So that seems consistent.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the carbonyl in the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester or possibly an amide. But earlier I thought that 1720 is higher than typical amide I bands. So more likely an ester.

So the compound has an ester group. Looking at the options, options D and B are the only ones with ester or amide groups.

Wait, option D is an ester. Option B is a formamide, which is an amide.

So if the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester, then options D and perhaps another. Option B has a formamide, which would typically have a lower carbonyl peak, around 1650. So maybe option D is more likely.

So putting it all together:

- IR: 1720 cm-1 → ester.

- NMR:

  - 1.20 (t, 3H) → CH3 of ethyl.

  - 4.5 (q, 2H) → OCH2 of ethyl ester.

  - 4.0 (bs, 2H) → possibly NH2? But in option D, the NH2 is aromatic amine, which might be broad but perhaps not seen in the NMR due to exchange broadening. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of another group.

Wait, in option D, the structure is OCOOCH2CH3 attached to the benzene, with NH2 at position 4. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. Ring amines (like aniline) typically have NH2 protons that are broad and can appear as singlets or doublets. But in the case of aniline, the NH2 protons are usually around 6-7 ppm, but in the data, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm. That seems off. So perhaps the NH2 isn't showing up in the NMR, or perhaps it's not present.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the option analysis. Let me check again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OCO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which has an NH2 group at position 4.

So the NH2 would be part of the aromatic ring. In aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are typically broad, but their chemical shifts can vary. In this case, the NH2 is adjacent to the ester group. Maybe the NH2 is deshielded and appears around 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet, but that's unusual. Usually, aniline NH2 is around 6-8 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So maybe the 4.0 ppm peak isn't the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from something else. Wait, what about the ethyl group? The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5, as per the data. So that matches. The CH3 is a triplet at 1.2, which matches. So the ethyl group is accounted for.

The 4.0 ppm broad signal is 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's an exchange broadened peak, like NH2, but shifted. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 from another group.

Wait, looking back, let's think about the aromatic protons. The data shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So in option D, the substituents are OCOOEt and NH2. 

In the case of 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1 (assuming numbering). So the ring would have two substituents in para positions. The aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. The substituent with the amino group is activating, so the ortho and para protons would be more shielded. The ester is deactivating, so its ortho and para protons would be deshielded. So the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would correspond to the protons adjacent to the amino group (more shielded) and the protons adjacent to the ester (less shielded, more downfield). That fits.

So, putting this together, the ethyl ester part matches the NMR data except for the OCH2 quartet's position. The aromatic protons match the expected pattern. The IR suggests an ester, which fits option D. The NH2 might not show up in the NMR if it's under exchange broadening, or perhaps it's another group.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Option D: 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester has the formula C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches.

So, the possible answer is D.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me compare with the other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. The formamide's carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1 in IR, which doesn't match the strong band at 1720. So the ester is more likely.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If it's an ester, the structure would be OOC-CH2CH2-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, that's not correct because the ester would be from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's a propionamide, the structure would be NH2-C6H4-CONH-CH2CH2CH3. That would have an amide group, and the carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1. The IR here is 1720, which suggests it's an ester, not an amide. So option C is less likely.

So, after considering all options, the data seems to fit option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound C9H11NO2 is to be identified using the provided spectroscopic data:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Molecular Formula**: C9H11NO2 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (6 carbons), an ethoxy group (2 carbons), and additional functional groups.

2. **IR Data**:
   - **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These bands are consistent with N-H stretches, likely from an amine or amide group.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong band indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide. The higher wavenumber suggests an ester rather than an amide.

3. **1H NMR Data**:
   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (OCH2CH3).
   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from NH2 protons or another group.
   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from the OCH2 group of an ethyl ester.
   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

4. **Spectroscopic Consistency**:
   - The **1720 cm⁻¹ IR band** strongly suggests an ester group.
   - The **NMR data** matches the expected splitting and integration for an ethyl ester group (triplet at 1.20 ppm for CH3 and quartet at 4.5 ppm for OCH2).
   - The aromatic protons (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: This is an amide, and the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ does not match amides, which typically show lower wavenumbers (~1650 cm⁻¹). Additionally, the NMR data does not fully align with this structure.
   - **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: This is also an amide, and the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is inconsistent with amides. The NMR data does not support this structure either.
   - **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: If this were an ester, the carbonyl IR band would match, but the molecular formula and NMR data do not align with this structure. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm does not fit well with this option.
   - **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: This is an ester, and the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches. The NMR data aligns well:
     - The triplet at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the CH3 of the ethyl ester.
     - The quartet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.
     - The doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.
     - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could correspond to the NH2 group, which may be shifted due to exchange broadening.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data and molecular formula are consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
