Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

First, I should figure out what the starting material looks like. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait. Benzene rings have substituents numbered based on their positions. So 1-bromo would be in position 1, and the "-2-d" partâ€”oh, wait, maybe that's a typo? Wait, no, looking again, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene can't have a "d" as a substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm misreading the structure. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because sometimes para positions are called "d", but I'm not too sure. Wait, wait, I think the correct way is to figure out that the substituents are on positions 1 and 2. So the compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. So the substituents are adjacent to each other.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But in the context of aromatic compounds, perhaps it's acting as a base to deprotonate something.

Wait, but benzene doesn't have acidic protons. Oh wait, but when there are strong electron-withdrawing groups attached to benzene, like nitro groups or, in this case, a bromine (which is an EWG), the ring can undergo some reactions. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the benzene ring are activating or deactivating.

Wait, the substituents here are Br (EWG, meta director) and dimethylamino group (a strong activating, ortho/para director). So the dimethylamino is a strong activating group because it's an amine, which donates electrons through resonance. So the ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution, especially at positions ortho and para to the dimethylamino group.

But wait, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. Another thought: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Hmm, but that's more for aliphatic systems. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Ullmann type coupling, but that usually involves copper catalysts.

Wait, another possibility: when you have a bromide on a benzene ring, and you treat it with a strong base, you could get elimination, but in aromatic systems, elimination isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's about the deprotonation leading to some kind of aromatic rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the leaving group (Br) should be activated towards attack by a nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a strong base, but could it act as a nucleophile? Alternatively, the ammonia might be the nucleophile.

Wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. That typically happens when the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups. So, in this case, the Br is already an EWG, but the dimethylamino is an activating group. Wait, but those are opposite effects. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are for a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for alkanes. Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is about elimination, but since benzene is a ring, perhaps it's about forming a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. Or perhaps it's about aromatic substitution.

Wait, what's the structure again? 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

If NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. But wait, benzene is already fully conjugated; you can't just form a double bond there. Alternatively, maybe the Br is removed, and a new substituent is added.

Wait, perhaps the Br is replaced by something else. If the ammonia acts as a nucleophile, maybe it substitutes the Br. But the conditions for nucleophilic aromatic substitution usually require a deactivating group. Since the ring has a strong activating group (dimethylamino), perhaps the ring is too activated for nucleophilic substitution. Because nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings tends to occur when the ring is deactivated (electron-withdrawing groups) which makes the ring more electron-deficient, attracting nucleophiles.

Wait, but in our case, the ring has a strong activating group (dimethylamino) which is electron-donating. So the ring is activated for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So maybe substitution isn't the pathway here.

Another angle: maybe the NaNH2 is causing some kind of elimination, but in the aromatic ring, elimination would require a hydrogen that's adjacent to the Br. Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons via double bonds. So if we lose H and Br, would that form a triple bond or something? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene, but benzene is a monocyclic compound, so I don't think that's applicable.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of aromatic ring substitution via a strong base causing a deprotonation, which then leads to some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but that typically involves Cu and other conditions, and I don't think NaNH2 is used there.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products. Let me imagine what could happen. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene.

If the Br is replaced by something else, like NH2, but under what conditions? Alternatively, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and the ring undergoes some change.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dimethylamino group is deprotonated. Wait, but dimethylamine is quite a strong base and would already be deprotonated under these conditions. Wait, but the dimethylamino group is attached to the benzene ring. The NH in the dimethylamino group is part of an amine, which is a good proton donor. But under strongly basic conditions, maybe the amine would lose a proton. But wait, in such a case, the amine would be deprotonated, becoming NMe2^- but that's not likely under such conditions because NaNH2 is the base. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is acting as a base, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of a benzannulation, but I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Let me think. For nucleophilic substitution to occur, the ring must be activated for nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. But in this case, the ring has a strong activating group (dimethylamino) which donates electrons, making the ring more reactive towards electrophiles, not nucleophiles.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the dimethylamino group is in a position that can deprotonate to form a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is in a position where the ring can undergo some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond somewhere else, but that doesn't seem feasible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. What if the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but on the ring. Wait, in aliphatic systems, dehydrohalogenation forms alkenes via elimination. But in aromatic rings, that's not possible because they're already fully conjugated.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a demetallation or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is leaving as Br^- and being replaced by something else. But what would that something else be? If NaNH2 is present, perhaps NH2^- is the nucleophile. But would that substitution occur under these conditions?

Wait, but for nucleophilic aromatic substitution to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. That usually requires that the ring is electron-deficient, which can be achieved by strong electron-withdrawing groups. Let me see: our ring has a Br (which is slightly deactivating, ortho/para-directing) and a dimethylamino group (strongly activating, ortho/para-directing). The presence of both might have a net effect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, so the ring is rich in electrons. That would make it more reactive towards electrophiles, not nucleophiles. So I'm not sure that nucleophilic substitution would occur here. Maybe not.

Wait, but maybe the NaNH2 is causing the dimethylamino group to undergo some reaction. For instance, perhaps it's deprotonating something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But I'm not sure about the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but without a catalyst, that seems unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible products. Let's say that the Br is replaced by an amine group. Then the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But how many isomers could that form?

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. If the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would have two amine groups on adjacent positions. But are there any possible regioisomers? Since you're just replacing Br, the product would be a single compound. Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are adjacent. So if the Br is replaced, the two substituents (dimethylamino and NH2) would be on adjacent positions.

But wait, another possibility. Maybe the Br is eliminated, and a double bond is formed. But benzene is already a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating double bonds, so removing a Br and a H from adjacent positions wouldn't form a double bond because the ring can't have more than one double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion or contraction, but I don't think that's happening here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is being removed, and the ring undergoes some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by a stronger activating group, but I'm not sure what that would lead to.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I know that NaNH2 is a strong base and is used in deprotonation reactions. Also, in some cases, it's used for elimination, like the formation of alkenes from halides (dehydrohalogenation). But in aromatic systems, perhaps it's used for dehalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm starting to think that perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. So, the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted, leading to the formation of a triple bond in the ring. But that's impossible because benzene can't have a triple bond. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a C-H deprotonation adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a new ring or substituent. For example, forming a benzannulated ring or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is being replaced by another group, but I'm not certain which group would be introduced.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the Br is replaced by an amine group. But as I thought earlier, the ring is activated by the dimethylamino group, which makes it more reactive towards electrophiles, not nucleophiles. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the Br is being removed and the dimethylamino group is somehow involved in the substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Br leaves as Br^- and the ring undergoes some kind of aromatic rearrangement, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the Br is replaced by another group, but without a catalyst, I don't see how that would proceed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but involves the dimethylamino group. For example, maybe the dimethylamino group is being deprotonated, leading to some kind of elimination. But the dimethylamino group is a good base itself; would it deprotonate under NaNH2 conditions?

Wait, NaNH2 has a very high pH because NH2^- is a strong base. So, any acidic proton would be deprotonated. But the dimethylamino group is itself a strong base. Wait, the pKa of a dimethylamino proton (like in (CH3)2NH2^+) is about 10. So in a solution with a pH around 35 (which is way higher than that), the dimethylamino group would be deprotonated. So perhaps that's what's happening.

So, in this scenario, the dimethylamino group would lose a proton, becoming (CH3)2NH^â€“. But how does that affect the reaction?

If the dimethylamino group is deprotonated, perhaps it could act as a base, abstracting a proton from the benzene ring. But the benzene ring's protons are usually not acidic enough to be deprotonated under such conditions. Unless there's some activating effect.

Wait, but if the dimethylamino group is deprotonated and becomes a stronger base, maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br. Let me think, the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino is at position 2. So the adjacent carbons would be position 3 and position 6, perhaps. So, if the ring's hydrogen at position 3 is abstracted, then perhaps the Br could leave, and a double bond forms between positions 2 and 3.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds; removing a hydrogen and the Br would leave a double bond, but that would disrupt the aromaticity. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzyn intermediate, which is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. I recall that when a bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, especially with a leaving group adjacent to an activating group, it can lead to elimination, forming a triple bond, but that's in aliphatic systems. But in aromatic systems, perhaps a similar process could occur, leading to a ring contraction or some other structural change, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of aniline derivatives. Like, replacing the Br with an amino group.

Wait, if the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would have two amino groups adjacent to each other. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, so if the Br is replaced by NH2, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But would that reaction occur under these conditions?

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where the Br is replaced by another aromatic ring, but without a catalyst like copper, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a demetallation, but I don't think so.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a nitrile group. But I don't see how NaNH2 would lead to that.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again about the possible products.

If the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene, which is a single compound. But are there any other possible products?

Wait, another possibility: if the Br is replaced by an amino group, but the amino group could be either NH2 or the dimethylamino group. No, wait, the dimethylamino is already present. So substitution would replace Br with NH2, leading to a single product.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and the ring forms a new substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a cyano group. But that would require a different reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is removed, and a new substituent is formed from the dimethylamino group. For example, maybe the dimethylamino group is oxidized or something, but I don't think NaNH2 does that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, and the reaction is an electrophilic substitution. But what would the electrophile be in this case?

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is attacked by the ammonia, leading to substitution. But ammonia is a weak nucleophile. Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amides, not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a benzyl-type structure, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. The reagents are NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might deprotonate something.

Wait, the dimethylamino group is a good proton source. So perhaps the NH in (CH3)2NH2+ is deprotonated to form (CH3)2NH^-.

Once deprotonated, the amino group becomes a stronger base. Now, perhaps this deprotonated amino group could abstract a proton from the benzene ring adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br and the formation of a new double bond.

Wait, but benzene is already fully conjugated. Forming a new double bond would require breaking the aromaticity, which is unlikely because that's energetically unfavorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzyn intermediate, which is a triple bond in the ring. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, benzyn is a very reactive intermediate, and the formation is typically done under harsh conditions, like with a strong base and a good leaving group. So maybe that's what's happening here.

If the benzyn is formed, it's a diradical that can capture a proton, but under these conditions, perhaps it would rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn is formed and then quenched with something else.

But in this reaction, the solvent is condensed ammonia, so perhaps the benzyn would react with NH3 to form an azobenzene derivative.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the benzyn could dimerize or undergo other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn is not formed, but the elimination leads to the loss of Br and the formation of a new substituent.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination leads to the formation of a nitrile group. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and the ring contracts to form a smaller ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the Br is replaced by an NH2 group, that would give 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But, wait, that's a single product.

Alternatively, if the Br is removed and nothing replaces it, the product would be 2-dimethylaminobenzene, also known as aniline derivative. But that's a single product.

Wait, but the starting material has two substituents. So if the Br is replaced, you have two substituents again. If the Br is eliminated, you have one substituent left.

Wait, but the reaction conditions would dictate which pathway is more favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the dimethylamino group is involved in the substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a ketone group, but that doesn't make much sense with the reagents present.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on this. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the substitution occurs, and the Br is replaced by NH2, that's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and the ring undergoes some change, leading to another product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces more than one product because of possible positions of substitution.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are on positions 1 and 2. So any substitution would have specific positions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to the possibility of substitution at different positions.

But in the starting material, the Br is at position 1 and the dimethylamino is at position 2. So substitution would occur at position 1, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination is possible, leading to a structure with a triple bond in the ring, but that would be a single product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling between the Br and another part of the molecule, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Br is displaced, and the amine group is involved in a coupling, leading to the formation of a larger ring or a different structure. But without more information, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, leading to no product, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but with NaNH2 as the catalyst. No, I don't think so; Friedel-Crafts usually uses AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an aromatic nucleophilic substitution. But as I thought earlier, the ring is activated by the dimethylamino group, which makes it more reactive towards electrophiles, not nucleophiles.

Wait, but wait. The presence of a strong base and a good leaving group (Br) might lead to elimination. So perhaps the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted, leading to the formation of a new double bond. But in aromatic compounds, that's not possible without disrupting aromaticity. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a nitro group, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where the Br is replaced by another group, but without a catalyst, that's unlikely.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of what NaNH2 does in similar reactions.

Wait, I recall that NaNH2 can be used to dehalogenate certain compounds, especially in the presence of a strong activating group. For example, in the presence of a strong activating group like -O^- (as in phenoxide), NaNH2 can induce dehalogenation, leading to the formation of a new substituent.

Wait, in this case, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and the ring forms a new bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but for benzene, that's not feasible.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a demethylation of the dimethylamino group, but I don't think that's possible under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps the dimethylamino group is deprotonated, making it a better leaving group, but I don't think (CH3)2NH^- is a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the deprotonated dimethylamino group, but that's unlikely.

Wait, I'm really not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible products again. If the reaction leads to substitution, perhaps the product is 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. That's one product.

But what if elimination occurs, leading to the loss of Br and the formation of a new structure. Maybe the ring becomes a naphthalene or something else, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a ketone group and an amine group, but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by another substituent, but without knowing what, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a coupling between the Br and the dimethylamino group, but I don't know the mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring contraction, leading to a smaller ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible number of products.

The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to substitution, perhaps only one product is formed.

Alternatively, if elimination leads to a new product, plus substitution, maybe two products.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple substitution sites possible, but in this structure, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So any substitution would occur at position 1, replacing the Br.

Wait, but if the substitution isn't clean, perhaps there's more than one product. But I think substitution would lead to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to different regiochemistry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dimethylamino group is in a position that allows for two different substitution pathways. For example, perhaps the Br can be substituted in two different positions, but in this case, the Br is at position 1, so substitution would only occur there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but involves the dimethylamino group. For example, perhaps it's a deammination or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring, like a seven-membered ring, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituted amino group. For example, the Br is replaced by NH2, giving a single product.

But if the Br is eliminated, perhaps the ring undergoes some change, leading to another product.

Wait, but I don't know what that change would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new substituent, but without knowing the exact mechanism, I can't say.

Hmm, this is proving to be quite challenging. Maybe I should consider that the reaction leads to the substitution of the Br by an amine group, giving one product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of the Br and the dimethylamino group, but that would require a double elimination, which is less likely.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of aniline derivatives, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the loss of H and Br to form a triple bond, but that would require a non-aromatic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a cyano group, but that would require a different reagent.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should conclude that only one product is formed, which is the substitution product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by another substituent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dimethylamino group is involved in a rearrangement, leading to more than one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of the Br and the formation of a new substituent in another position, but that would require some kind of ring expansion or substitution.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is a benzyne intermediate formation, which can lead to different products upon trapping. For example, if the elimination forms benzyne, which can then react with ammonia to form different products.

Wait, if the reaction forms benzyne, which is a very reactive diradical, and then ammonia adds to it, perhaps in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, but the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2. The benzyne would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, perhaps, which would make the ring non-aromatic. But then, if ammonia adds across the triple bond, it could form a new structure.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne intermediates can lead to different products depending on where the addition occurs. But in this case, with the substituents present, the addition would be directed.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne would form, and then the ammonia would add across the triple bond, leading to the formation of a ring with two new substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne would dimerize, but that's another possibility.

Wait, if the benzyne forms, it could rearrange or undergo addition in different ways. So perhaps the reaction could lead to more than one product.

But without more knowledge of this specific reaction, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of the Br and the formation of a new substituent, which could be in either position, leading to multiple products.

But in the starting material, the Br is in position 1 and the dimethylamino in position 2. So substitution would only occur at position 1, leading to a single product.

Hmm. I'm still not sure. Maybe I should go with the initial thought that substitution leads to one product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of the Br, but the product could have the substituents in different positions, leading to more than one product. But in this case, substitution would only occur at position 1, so only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of Br and the formation of an amino group, but that's substitution again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of Br by NH2, giving one product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

So, the most plausible scenario is that substitution occurs, leading to one product. So the answer would be B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethylamine (1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene) with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia. The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine atom at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. The dimethylamino group is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group, while bromine is a weakly deactivating, ortho/para-directing group.

NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base and can act as a nucleophile under these conditions. The reaction likely proceeds via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the bromine atom is replaced by an amino group (NHâ‚‚). This substitution occurs at position 1, where the bromine is located. The dimethylamino group at position 2 does not interfere with this substitution because the substituents are already in fixed positions on the benzene ring.

The product of this reaction is 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene, which is a single compound. There are no other possible products because the reaction does not involve elimination, rearrangement, or multiple substitution pathways. The reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material ensure that only one product is formed.

Answer: B
