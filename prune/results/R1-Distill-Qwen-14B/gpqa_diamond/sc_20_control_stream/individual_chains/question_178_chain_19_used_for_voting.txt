Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric, and they come up in things like the spinor representation of angular momentum or maybe in some higher-order terms in QED.

The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a dimension and a yes/no on renormalizability.

First, I should recall how to find the mass dimension of a coupling constant in a Lagrangian. The idea is that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension [Lagrangian] = 4, because the action S = ∫ d^4x L has to be dimensionless (since it's in the exponential in the path integral, which is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So for the given L_int, the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break down each part.

The fields involved are ψ (a Dirac spinor), F^{μν} (the field strength tensor of electromagnetism, which is antisymmetric and made from derivatives of the gauge field A_mu: F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ).

Wait, but the Lagrangian is interaction, so I suppose it's part of a larger Lagrangian. But for the purpose of finding the dimension of κ, I can consider each field's dimension.

In 4 dimensions (since we're talking about renormalizability and the usual QFT setup), the fields have specific mass dimensions. Let me recall:

- A Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and integrating d^4x (dimension 4) multiplied by L (dim 4) gives a dimensionless S. Also, for the kinetic term in the Dirac Lagrangian, we have i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. ∂_μ has dimension 1 (since it's like derivative with respect to x^μ, which is dimension 1). So ψ̄, being a spinor, same as ψ, so each ψ is [ψ] = 3/2. Because [ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ] must be 4. So (3/2 + 3/2) from ψ̄ and ψ, plus [∂] which is 1, so total 3 + 1 =4. Yep.

- The field strength tensor F_{μν} is made from ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu. So each term in F has the same dimension as ∂ A. Since A is a gauge field, which has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A is like F^2, and F has dimension 2 (since A has 1, each derivative adds 1, so ∂ A is 2). So [F] = 2.

Now let's break down the term in L_int: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, let's find the dimension of each part:

ψ̄ σ ψ: σ is a product of two gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (gamma matrices are just matrices, no mass dimension). So ψ̄ has [3/2], σ is [0], and ψ has [3/2]. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which has dimension 2. So the term is (3 + 2) =5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the entire term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So the term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) times F. So each field's dimension adds, and κ is the coupling.

Wait, the entire term must have dimension 4, since it's part of the Lagrangian.

So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, but [ψ̄ σ ψ] is [ψ] * [ψ] * [σ], but σ is a product of gammas, which are dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] = [ψ]^2. [ψ] is 3/2, so [ψ]^2 is 3. Then [F] is 2.

So 3 (from ψ terms) + 2 (from F) =5. So [kappa] +5 =4 → [kappa]=4-5= -1.

So the dimension of κ is -1. So that would mean options A or C.

Now, the second part, whether the theory is renormalizable.

Renormalizability is determined by the mass dimension of the coupling constants. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. If any have negative dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable (since it would require an infinite number of counterterms, or you can't absorb the divergences into a finite set of parameters).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling tells us about renormalizability. In 4 dimensions, a coupling with dimension d is allowed in a renormalizable theory only if d ≥ 0. Because the interaction term is of the form g φ^n, and the dimension is [g] = 4 - n [φ]. If [g] ≥ 0, then 4 -n [φ] ≥0 → n [φ] ≤4. So for example, in scalar φ^4 theory, [φ]=1, so [g] =0, which is okay.

In our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the coupling has negative mass dimension. That implies that the theory is non-renormalizable. Because when you have a coupling with negative mass dimension, the interaction term is of higher dimension, and you can't write down a finite number of counterterms to absorb the divergences.

So the Lagrangian has a term with mass dimension -1, so the theory is not renormalizable. So the second part of the answer is that it's not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No, because κ is negative, theory is not renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable → [κ] is positive, but wait, our calculation said [κ] is -1, so B is incorrect.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable → Correct.

D) [κ]=1, not renormalizable → Incorrect on both.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \). The fields involved are the Dirac spinor \( \psi \) and the field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \), which has the same dimension as \( \partial_\mu A_\nu \) (since \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \)).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} \), as it appears in the kinetic term \( i \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi \), which must have mass dimension 4.
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( [F^{\mu\nu}] = 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has mass dimension 1.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The interaction term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must have mass dimension 4, as it is part of the Lagrangian. Breaking it down:
- \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \): Since \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a product of two dimensionless gamma matrices, the dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) is \( [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \): The dimension of \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is 2.

Thus, the total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi ] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4.
\]
Solving for \( [\kappa] \), we find:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 3 - 2 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the theory is not renormalizable, as it would require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
