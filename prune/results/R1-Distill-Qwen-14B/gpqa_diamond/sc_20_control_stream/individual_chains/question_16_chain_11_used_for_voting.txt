Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a non-superimposable mirror image. So basically, if a compound has a chiral center, it can be optically active. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like allenes or other structures that might have multiple stereocenters or some kind of symmetry.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait wait, no, because it's but-1-ene. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is also the double bond. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), no, wait but that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H? Not sure, but the point is, for optical activity, does it have a chiral center? Let me see: Each carbon in the molecule. Carbon 1 is Cl, CH2 which is double bonded. Wait, the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on C1: Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, but that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1, which is a double bond. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the but-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first CH2. So Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Now, let's look for chiral centers. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2Cl, which is CH2Cl, so two Hs and a Cl and a double bond. So it's a sp² hybridized carbon. Does that make it a chiral center? No, because sp² carbons can't be chiral centers because they have three substituents (plus the double bond), so they can't have four different groups. Wait, no, sp² carbons can't be chiral because a chiral center needs four different substituents attached, which would require four single bonds. So in this case, the carbons involved in the double bond are sp², so they are trigonal. So they can't be chiral centers. So this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. So is it optically active? No, unless there's some other form of asymmetry. But in this case, I think it's not. So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait another thing. The molecule is (Z) configuration. So does that affect optical activity? No, because E/Z is about the arrangement around a double bond, but doesn't create a chiral center. So this molecule is not chiral, so no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a complex name. Let me try to parse it. Hexahydro suggests six-membered ring with some hydrogen, but wait, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Methano suggests a bridge with a CH2 group. Isobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused to a furan. So but with a methano substitution, so perhaps a bridge between positions 4 and 7. The substituents are at position 8: chloromethylene, which is CH2Cl. Also, the E configuration is for the chloromethylene group. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key here is whether the molecule has a chiral center. The substituents are at 3aR and 7aS, so I think those are stereocenters. So if those are chiral centers, then this compound is chiral, so it would be optically active. So yes, this would exhibit optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereochemistry is R at C2 and S at C3. Wait, but wait, the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons. Let me think if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule is chiral. Let's imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(R)-CH(S)-COOH, with R and S configurations. Wait, but wait, if the two stereocenters are in a trans or cis arrangement, does that affect symmetry? Let me draw it. The two central carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group and a hydroxyl (from the acid) and two other substituents. Wait, in succinic acid, the central carbons are each connected to two CH2 groups. So in this case, the C2 has substituents: methyl, two CH2 groups, and a COOH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has CH(CH3) groups. So for each carbon, the substituents are: COOH (on C2, via the adjacent C), CH(CH3), another CH(CH3), and a hydrogen? No, wait, wait. Wait, each C is connected to: C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and two other substituents. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait, when you have 2 and 3 dimethyl, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? Wait, no, that would make the structure HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each CH(CH3) is connected to the next. Now, each of C2 and C3 has CH(CH3), and the other groups. Let me see the substituents on each carbon:

For C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups? Wait no, wait, maybe C2 has: COOH (from C1), CH3, CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a hydrogen. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have the following substituents:

C2: COOH (from C1), CH3, CH2 (from C3?), and another CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have the following groups:

C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), a CH(CH3) (from C3?), and another substituent. Wait, perhaps each has:

- One COOH group (as part of the C2-COOH)
- One methyl group (CH3)
- One CH(CH3) (from the adjacent carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents. For C2, if it's CH(CH3), then the groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), and two more substituents. Wait, actually, each C in the chain is connected to two other Cs, so:

C1: COOH, connected to C2.
C2: COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH2?
Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of succinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So each CH2 is a central carbon. When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group, and the rest are CH2 (but in this case, they're CH(CH3)).

Now, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has the following substituents:

For C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a hydrogen? No, wait, each central carbon is connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2), and two substituents (CH3 and H?).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents for each of C2 and C3 in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Each of those carbons has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups (from adjacent carbons?)
Wait, no, I'm not getting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has the following groups:

C2: -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3), and two more substituents. Wait, no, I think each C is connected to two other Cs (C1 and C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If C2 and C3 have opposite configurations (R and S), could that create a meso compound?

Yes! Because succinic acid is a meso compound when both chiral centers are present with opposite configurations. So in (2R,3S), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it achiral, hence no optical activity. Wait, but wait: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, which is a meso compound when the central two CH2 are replaced by CH groups with opposite configurations. So in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with (2R,3S), it is a meso compound, so no optical activity. So this compound is not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same as the previous, but both R configurations. So now, let's see if this is a meso compound or not.

If both are R, then would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? No, because the configurations are the same, so the central plane would flip the configurations, but since both are R, it wouldn't lead to a superimposable mirror image. So this molecule would be chiral, hence optically active.

Wait, let me think again. If the two stereocenters are both R, then flipping the molecule across the central plane would change each R to S, making it (2S,3S), which is different from (2R,3R). So the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Hence, it's chiral. So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So this is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on carbon 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The configuration is R. So cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH on C1, and the double bond from C3 to C4.

Now, in the ring, what's the structure? Let me imagine the cyclohexene ring. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the ring is in a chair conformation or something else. The OH is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a CH group (from C6, perhaps? Wait, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are OH, and the two adjacent carbons (each CH2 groups, perhaps). Wait, but wait, in the ring, the positions around are:

C1: OH, connected to C2 and C6.

C2: connected to C1 and C3.

C3: double bond to C4.

C4: double bond to C3, and connected to C5.

C5: connected to C4 and C6.

C6: connected to C5 and C1.

So, the substituents on C1 (the OH-bearing carbon) are: OH, C2, C6, and another substituent. Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, but what about the other two substituents? Oh wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring has two substituents besides the ring bonds. So C1 has OH, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), but wait, that would be a chiral center. So if C1 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Wait, wait: C1 is attached to two ring carbons (C2 and C6), the OH group, and another substituent? Or is it that in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents (like H or other groups). Let me think of cyclohexene. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So C1 has substituents: OH, and then what else? The ring bonds connect to C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, and three other substituents which are the two CH2 groups from C2 and C6, and maybe a hydrogen? Or maybe not. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring and two substituents. For C1, the substituents are OH, and a hydrogen? Or are they all CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. The key is whether C1 has four different groups attached. So C1 has: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and another substituent. Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, and the other two substituents (like H or other groups). So for C1, the substituents are: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. No, wait, that's not right. For example, in cyclohexane, each carbon has two ring bonds (so two CH2 groups), and two Hs. So if it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure would have an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

So let's imagine C1: attached to OH, and connected to C2 and C6. The other two substituents on C1 would be two Hs? Or maybe not, because in a six-membered ring with a double bond, the substituents might differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is on C1, and the structure is such that C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a CH group (from C2 or C6)? I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not. If the molecule is such that there's a plane of symmetry through C1, then it wouldn't be chiral. But given that the double bond is between C3 and C4, the substituents on C1 might not be symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So if C1 has four different substituents, then it's chiral. Therefore, since it's (R) configuration, it's chiral, so it would exhibit optical activity. So this compound is optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So this is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. Let's see if this molecule is chiral. If all three OHs are on the same face (all axial or all equatorial), but the configuration is s, which would depend on the substituents around each carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because the OH groups are on 1,3,5 positions, which are every other carbon, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring. If the OH groups are at C1, C3, and C5, then they are at every other position. So the ring would have three OH groups in a symmetric fashion. For example, if all are axial, or all equatorial, but if the configuration is such that they form a trigonal symmetric arrangement, the molecule might not be chiral.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are in the s configuration, but arranged symmetrically. Let me think about the possible symmetry. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration (say, all axial), but in a cyclohexane ring, this would lead to a symmetric structure. For example, in the chair conformation, having OH axial at C1, C3, and C5 would create a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making the molecule achiral. So in that case, the molecule would not be chiral, hence no optical activity.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then it would be chiral. But with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. For example, a mirror plane that runs through the center of the ring and perpendicular to it. So, the molecule would be achiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let's think about whether all three substituents can have the same configuration and the molecule still be chiral. For instance, a molecule with three OH groups on a cyclohexane ring at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same stereochemistry, might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have all OH groups axial and pointing in the same direction, then flipping the molecule over a mirror plane would superimpose, making it achiral. So this molecule is not chiral and won't exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-CH3? Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-? No, wait. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, wait. Let me clarify: butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is CH2=CH-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, butan-1-one is (cyclopentyl) attached to the first carbon of a four-carbon chain, which is a ketone at C1.

Wait, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is: cyclopentyl group attached to C1, and a ketone group also on C1 (since it's butan-1-one). Then, on C3, there's a methyl group. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3?

Wait, but butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)3CH3, but with a cyclopentyl group on C1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? Or does the cyclopentyl group replace one of the substituents on C1?

Alternatively, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately written as:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3, but with the cyclopentyl on the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to the cyclopentyl and to the rest of the chain. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are: O=C-, cyclopentyl, CH2CH(CH3)CH3, and another substituent? Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is connected to O, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's connected to the cyclopentyl, and three other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons in the chain with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)2CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the cyclopentyl replaces one of the CH2 groups. No, wait, the substituents on C1 (the carbonyl carbon) would be O, cyclopentyl, and two other substituents. Since it's butan-1-one, the chain is four carbons, but the carbonyl is on C1. So after the carbonyl, there are three more carbons, which would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking at C3, which has a methyl group. So, the structure would have a methyl group on C3. Let me imagine the substituents on C3: is there a possibility of four different groups?

The structure around C3 would be:

- Connected to C2 (which is CH2 from the carbonyl group), connected to C4 (CH2), and a CH3 (methyl group), and another substituent. Wait, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is a CH2 group from the carbonyl.

- C4: another CH2 group.

- A methyl group.

- And a hydrogen? If that's the case, then C3 would have four different substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. So that would make C3 a chiral center. So the molecule would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait: the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, the cyclopentyl is on C1, and the methyl is on C3. So the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but butan-1-one would have four carbons in the chain. So the carbonyl is on C1, and the chain is C1 (O=C), C2, C3, C4. So C4 would be the end. So the structure would be O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So in this case, the cyclopentyl is on C1, so the structure is O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But wait, that's three carbons after the carbonyl, making it butan-1-one. So the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH(CH3) (from C3, but that's itself),

- CH2 (from C4),

- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

So C3 would have four substituents: two CH2 groups, a CH3, and a H. Are those four different groups? The two CH2 groups are the same, so C3 wouldn't be a chiral center because two substituents are identical. So in that case, C3 isn't chiral.

Wait, but that's confusing. Let me think again: if C3 is CH(CH3), then its substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH2 (from C4),

- CH3,

- H.

So the substituents are: CH2 (two instances), CH3, H. So two substituents are the same (CH2), so C3 is not a chiral center. Hence, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but then where else could there be a chiral center? The cyclopentyl group is a ring, but unless there's a substituent on the ring that creates a chiral center in the ring, the entire molecule wouldn't have any. But the cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is O=C, which is double-bonded to O, so it's sp² hybridized. So it can't be a chiral center. So the only other possibility is whether any other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the butanone chain:

C1: O=C connected to cyclopentyl, two CH2 groups, and perhaps another substituent. No, because in O=C-R, the R groups are cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain. Wait, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to O (double bond), cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and the rest of the chain). So substituents on C1 are O (double bond), cyclopentyl, CH2CH(CH3)CH2, and another CH2? No, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think in the case of this molecule, there's no chiral center. Because the C3 has two identical substituents (two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. Hence, this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the structure again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1, and the substituents connected to it are:

- O (double bond),

- cyclopentyl,

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is four carbons in total, so the carbonyl is on C1, and then C2, C3, C4 follow. So the structure is O=C-(CH2)1-CH(CH3)-(CH2)0? No, perhaps it's O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would make it pentanone, not butanone. So butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure is O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3). So the carbonyl is on C1, and then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2-CH3? No, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. So the chain is four carbons, so C1 is O=C, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, so it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So in 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. So C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2) and C4 (CH2). So substituents on C3: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), a CH3, and a H. So two substituents are the same (CH2), so C3 isn't a chiral center. So no chiral centers in the molecule. Hence, no optical activity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that C3 might be a chiral center, but now I'm concluding it isn't. So this molecule isn't optically active.

Now, let's go back and count how many compounds are optically active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not optically active. So 0.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Optically active. So +1. Total 1.

3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, so no optical activity. 0.

4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral, so yes. +1. Total 2.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral. +1. Total 3.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: A meso compound, so no. 0.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. 0.

So the total is 3 compounds that are optically active: numbers 2,4,5. Wait, that's three. So the answer would be option B, which is 3. But looking at the options, option D is 4. Did I miss one?

Wait, let me recount.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

Total: 3. So option B is 3, which is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with one of the compounds. Let's recheck each.

Wait, for compound 7, perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so after the carbonyl, there are three more carbons. So the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's five carbons, which would make it pentanone. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is O=C-(CH2)3-CH3. So in the 1-cyclopentyl substitution, the cyclopentyl is on the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. So the four carbons are: O=C-(cyclopentyl), then CH2, CH(CH3), CH3. So the substituents on C3 (the CH(CH3)) would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4),

- CH3,

- H.

So again, two substituents are CH2, so no chiral center. So no optical activity.

So total is 3. So the answer is B, which is 3. But looking back, the options given are:

Options:
A) 5
B) 3
C) 2
D) 4

So the correct answer should be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a non-superimposable mirror image, typically due to the presence of a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The molecule lacks any chiral centers because the carbons involved in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot have four different substituents. Additionally, the (Z) configuration does not create chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations. These stereocenters create chirality, making the molecule optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. However, due to the plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters, the molecule is a meso compound and not chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. Unlike the meso compound, the (2R,3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 and the double bond create a chiral center at carbon 1. The (R) configuration confirms the presence of chirality, making the molecule optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The three hydroxyl groups are positioned symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring, creating a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, despite the stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so no chiral centers are present.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, and 5. This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a non-superimposable mirror image. So basically, if a compound has a chiral center, it can be optically active. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like allenes or other structures that might have multiple stereocenters or some kind of symmetry.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait wait, no, because it's but-1-ene. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is also the double bond. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), no, wait but that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H? Not sure, but the point is, for optical activity, does it have a chiral center? Let me see: Each carbon in the molecule. Carbon 1 is Cl, CH2 which is double bonded. Wait, the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on C1: Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, but that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1, which is a double bond. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the but-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first CH2. So Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Now, let's look for chiral centers. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2Cl, which is CH2Cl, so two Hs and a Cl and a double bond. So it's a sp² hybridized carbon. Does that make it a chiral center? No, because sp² carbons can't be chiral centers because they have three substituents (plus the double bond), so they can't have four different groups. Wait, no, sp² carbons can't be chiral because a chiral center needs four different substituents attached, which would require four single bonds. So in this case, the carbons involved in the double bond are sp², so they are trigonal. So they can't be chiral centers. So this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. So is it optically active? No, unless there's some other form of asymmetry. But in this case, I think it's not. So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait another thing. The molecule is (Z) configuration. So does that affect optical activity? No, because E/Z is about the arrangement around a double bond, but doesn't create a chiral center. So this molecule is not chiral, so no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a complex name. Let me try to parse it. Hexahydro suggests six-membered ring with some hydrogen, but wait, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Methano suggests a bridge with a CH2 group. Isobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused to a furan. So but with a methano substitution, so perhaps a bridge between positions 4 and 7. The substituents are at position 8: chloromethylene, which is CH2Cl. Also, the E configuration is for the chloromethylene group. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key here is whether the molecule has a chiral center. The substituents are at 3aR and 7aS, so I think those are stereocenters. So if those are chiral centers, then this compound is chiral, so it would be optically active. So yes, this would exhibit optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereochemistry is R at C2 and S at C3. Wait, but wait, the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons. Let me think if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule is chiral. Let's imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(R)-CH(S)-COOH, with R and S configurations. Wait, but wait, if the two stereocenters are in a trans or cis arrangement, does that affect symmetry? Let me draw it. The two central carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group and a hydroxyl (from the acid) and two other substituents. Wait, in succinic acid, the central carbons are each connected to two CH2 groups. So in this case, the C2 has substituents: methyl, two CH2 groups, and a COOH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has CH(CH3) groups. So for each carbon, the substituents are: COOH (on C2, via the adjacent C), CH(CH3), another CH(CH3), and a hydrogen? No, wait, wait. Wait, each C is connected to: C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is another CH(CH3)), and two other substituents. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait, when you have 2 and 3 dimethyl, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? Wait, no, that would make the structure HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each CH(CH3) is connected to the next. Now, each of C2 and C3 has CH(CH3), and the other groups. Let me see the substituents on each carbon:

For C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups? Wait no, wait, maybe C2 has: COOH (from C1), CH3, CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a hydrogen. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have the following substituents:

C2: COOH (from C1), CH3, CH2 (from C3?), and another CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have the following groups:

C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), a CH(CH3) (from C3?), and another substituent. Wait, perhaps each has:

- One COOH group (as part of the C2-COOH)
- One methyl group (CH3)
- One CH(CH3) (from the adjacent carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents. For C2, if it's CH(CH3), then the groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), and two more substituents. Wait, actually, each C in the chain is connected to two other Cs, so:

C1: COOH, connected to C2.
C2: COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH2?
Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of succinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So each CH2 is a central carbon. When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group, and the rest are CH2 (but in this case, they're CH(CH3)).

Now, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has the following substituents:

For C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a hydrogen? No, wait, each central carbon is connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2), and two substituents (CH3 and H?).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents for each of C2 and C3 in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Each of those carbons has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups (from adjacent carbons?)
Wait, no, I'm not getting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has the following groups:

C2: -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3), and two more substituents. Wait, no, I think each C is connected to two other Cs (C1 and C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If C2 and C3 have opposite configurations (R and S), could that create a meso compound?

Yes! Because succinic acid is a meso compound when both chiral centers are present with opposite configurations. So in (2R,3S), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it achiral, hence no optical activity. Wait, but wait: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, which is a meso compound when the central two CH2 are replaced by CH groups with opposite configurations. So in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with (2R,3S), it is a meso compound, so no optical activity. So this compound is not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same as the previous, but both R configurations. So now, let's see if this is a meso compound or not.

If both are R, then would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? No, because the configurations are the same, so the central plane would flip the configurations, but since both are R, it wouldn't lead to a superimposable mirror image. So this molecule would be chiral, hence optically active.

Wait, let me think again. If the two stereocenters are both R, then flipping the molecule across the central plane would change each R to S, making it (2S,3S), which is different from (2R,3R). So the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Hence, it's chiral. So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So this is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on carbon 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The configuration is R. So cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH on C1, and the double bond from C3 to C4.

Now, in the ring, what's the structure? Let me imagine the cyclohexene ring. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the ring is in a chair conformation or something else. The OH is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a CH group (from C6, perhaps? Wait, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are OH, and the two adjacent carbons (each CH2 groups, perhaps). Wait, but wait, in the ring, the positions around are:

C1: OH, connected to C2 and C6.

C2: connected to C1 and C3.

C3: double bond to C4.

C4: double bond to C3, and connected to C5.

C5: connected to C4 and C6.

C6: connected to C5 and C1.

So, the substituents on C1 (the OH-bearing carbon) are: OH, C2, C6, and another substituent. Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, but what about the other two substituents? Oh wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring has two substituents besides the ring bonds. So C1 has OH, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), but wait, that would be a chiral center. So if C1 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Wait, wait: C1 is attached to two ring carbons (C2 and C6), the OH group, and another substituent? Or is it that in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents (like H or other groups). Let me think of cyclohexene. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So C1 has substituents: OH, and then what else? The ring bonds connect to C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, and three other substituents which are the two CH2 groups from C2 and C6, and maybe a hydrogen? Or maybe not. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring and two substituents. For C1, the substituents are OH, and a hydrogen? Or are they all CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. The key is whether C1 has four different groups attached. So C1 has: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and another substituent. Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, and the other two substituents (like H or other groups). So for C1, the substituents are: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. No, wait, that's not right. For example, in cyclohexane, each carbon has two ring bonds (so two CH2 groups), and two Hs. So if it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure would have an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

So let's imagine C1: attached to OH, and connected to C2 and C6. The other two substituents on C1 would be two Hs? Or maybe not, because in a six-membered ring with a double bond, the substituents might differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is on C1, and the structure is such that C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a CH group (from C2 or C6)? I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not. If the molecule is such that there's a plane of symmetry through C1, then it wouldn't be chiral. But given that the double bond is between C3 and C4, the substituents on C1 might not be symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So if C1 has four different substituents, then it's chiral. Therefore, since it's (R) configuration, it's chiral, so it would exhibit optical activity. So this compound is optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So this is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. Let's see if this molecule is chiral. If all three OHs are on the same face (all axial or all equatorial), but the configuration is s, which would depend on the substituents around each carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because the OH groups are on 1,3,5 positions, which are every other carbon, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring. If the OH groups are at C1, C3, and C5, then they are at every other position. So the ring would have three OH groups in a symmetric fashion. For example, if all are axial, or all equatorial, but if the configuration is such that they form a trigonal symmetric arrangement, the molecule might not be chiral.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are in the s configuration, but arranged symmetrically. Let me think about the possible symmetry. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration (say, all axial), but in a cyclohexane ring, this would lead to a symmetric structure. For example, in the chair conformation, having OH axial at C1, C3, and C5 would create a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making the molecule achiral. So in that case, the molecule would not be chiral, hence no optical activity.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then it would be chiral. But with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. For example, a mirror plane that runs through the center of the ring and perpendicular to it. So, the molecule would be achiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let's think about whether all three substituents can have the same configuration and the molecule still be chiral. For instance, a molecule with three OH groups on a cyclohexane ring at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same stereochemistry, might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have all OH groups axial and pointing in the same direction, then flipping the molecule over a mirror plane would superimpose, making it achiral. So this molecule is not chiral and won't exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-CH3? Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-? No, wait. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, wait. Let me clarify: butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is CH2=CH-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, butan-1-one is (cyclopentyl) attached to the first carbon of a four-carbon chain, which is a ketone at C1.

Wait, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is: cyclopentyl group attached to C1, and a ketone group also on C1 (since it's butan-1-one). Then, on C3, there's a methyl group. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3?

Wait, but butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)3CH3, but with a cyclopentyl group on C1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? Or does the cyclopentyl group replace one of the substituents on C1?

Alternatively, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately written as:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3, but with the cyclopentyl on the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to the cyclopentyl and to the rest of the chain. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are: O=C-, cyclopentyl, CH2CH(CH3)CH3, and another substituent? Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is connected to O, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's connected to the cyclopentyl, and three other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons in the chain with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)2CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the cyclopentyl replaces one of the CH2 groups. No, wait, the substituents on C1 (the carbonyl carbon) would be O, cyclopentyl, and two other substituents. Since it's butan-1-one, the chain is four carbons, but the carbonyl is on C1. So after the carbonyl, there are three more carbons, which would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking at C3, which has a methyl group. So, the structure would have a methyl group on C3. Let me imagine the substituents on C3: is there a possibility of four different groups?

The structure around C3 would be:

- Connected to C2 (which is CH2 from the carbonyl group), connected to C4 (CH2), and a CH3 (methyl group), and another substituent. Wait, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is a CH2 group from the carbonyl.

- C4: another CH2 group.

- A methyl group.

- And a hydrogen? If that's the case, then C3 would have four different substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. So that would make C3 a chiral center. So the molecule would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait: the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, the cyclopentyl is on C1, and the methyl is on C3. So the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but butan-1-one would have four carbons in the chain. So the carbonyl is on C1, and the chain is C1 (O=C), C2, C3, C4. So C4 would be the end. So the structure would be O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So in this case, the cyclopentyl is on C1, so the structure is O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But wait, that's three carbons after the carbonyl, making it butan-1-one. So the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH(CH3) (from C3, but that's itself),

- CH2 (from C4),

- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

So C3 would have four substituents: two CH2 groups, a CH3, and a H. Are those four different groups? The two CH2 groups are the same, so C3 wouldn't be a chiral center because two substituents are identical. So in that case, C3 isn't chiral.

Wait, but that's confusing. Let me think again: if C3 is CH(CH3), then its substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH2 (from C4),

- CH3,

- H.

So the substituents are: CH2 (two instances), CH3, H. So two substituents are the same (CH2), so C3 is not a chiral center. Hence, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but then where else could there be a chiral center? The cyclopentyl group is a ring, but unless there's a substituent on the ring that creates a chiral center in the ring, the entire molecule wouldn't have any. But the cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is O=C, which is double-bonded to O, so it's sp² hybridized. So it can't be a chiral center. So the only other possibility is whether any other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the butanone chain:

C1: O=C connected to cyclopentyl, two CH2 groups, and perhaps another substituent. No, because in O=C-R, the R groups are cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain. Wait, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to O (double bond), cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and the rest of the chain). So substituents on C1 are O (double bond), cyclopentyl, CH2CH(CH3)CH2, and another CH2? No, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think in the case of this molecule, there's no chiral center. Because the C3 has two identical substituents (two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. Hence, this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the structure again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1, and the substituents connected to it are:

- O (double bond),

- cyclopentyl,

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is four carbons in total, so the carbonyl is on C1, and then C2, C3, C4 follow. So the structure is O=C-(CH2)1-CH(CH3)-(CH2)0? No, perhaps it's O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would make it pentanone, not butanone. So butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure is O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3). So the carbonyl is on C1, and then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2-CH3? No, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. So the chain is four carbons, so C1 is O=C, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, so it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So in 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. So C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2) and C4 (CH2). So substituents on C3: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), a CH3, and a H. So two substituents are the same (CH2), so C3 isn't a chiral center. So no chiral centers in the molecule. Hence, no optical activity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that C3 might be a chiral center, but now I'm concluding it isn't. So this molecule isn't optically active.

Now, let's go back and count how many compounds are optically active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not optically active. So 0.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Optically active. So +1. Total 1.

3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, so no optical activity. 0.

4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral, so yes. +1. Total 2.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral. +1. Total 3.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: A meso compound, so no. 0.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. 0.

So the total is 3 compounds that are optically active: numbers 2,4,5. Wait, that's three. So the answer would be option B, which is 3. But looking at the options, option D is 4. Did I miss one?

Wait, let me recount.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

Total: 3. So option B is 3, which is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with one of the compounds. Let's recheck each.

Wait, for compound 7, perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so after the carbonyl, there are three more carbons. So the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's five carbons, which would make it pentanone. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is O=C-(CH2)3-CH3. So in the 1-cyclopentyl substitution, the cyclopentyl is on the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. So the four carbons are: O=C-(cyclopentyl), then CH2, CH(CH3), CH3. So the substituents on C3 (the CH(CH3)) would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4),

- CH3,

- H.

So again, two substituents are CH2, so no chiral center. So no optical activity.

So total is 3. So the answer is B, which is 3. But looking back, the options given are:

Options:
A) 5
B) 3
C) 2
D) 4

So the correct answer should be B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a non-superimposable mirror image, typically due to the presence of a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The molecule lacks any chiral centers because the carbons involved in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot have four different substituents. Additionally, the (Z) configuration does not create chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations. These stereocenters create chirality, making the molecule optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. However, due to the plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters, the molecule is a meso compound and not chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. Unlike the meso compound, the (2R,3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 and the double bond create a chiral center at carbon 1. The (R) configuration confirms the presence of chirality, making the molecule optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The three hydroxyl groups are positioned symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring, creating a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, despite the stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so no chiral centers are present.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, and 5. This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: B**
