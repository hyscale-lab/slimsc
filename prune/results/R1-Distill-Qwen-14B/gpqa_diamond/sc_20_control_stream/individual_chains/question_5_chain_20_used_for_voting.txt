Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Hmm, so I know that in quantum mechanics, the operator for angular momentum along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator P·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

Wait, right. So the operator in question is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. And we need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

But wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I'm looking for a state |ψ> such that (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

I remember that the eigenstates of angular momentum along an arbitrary direction are called eigenstates of the angular momentum operator and they can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics or in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but since P is a spin-1/2 operator, the eigenvectors will be two-component spinors. So the eigenvector should have two components, let's say (a, b), which we'll need to normalize.

First, let's write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], so it's [[0, -i ħ/2], [i ħ/2, 0]].

And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which gives [[ħ/2, 0],[0, -ħ/2]].

So the operator P·n is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since direction vector n lies in x-z plane, its y-component (n_y) is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. So n_y=0, and n is (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P·n becomes (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

Substituting the matrices, that would be:

n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) times:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this 2x2 matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So we have the equation (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me denote |ψ> as a two-component vector (a, b). Then, applying the operator matrix to |ψ> should give (ħ/2) times |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

( (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

So the two equations are:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

Let me write equation 2 as:

n_x a = (n_z + 1) b → a = [ (n_z + 1) / n_x ] b, assuming n_x ≠ 0.

Substitute a into equation 1:

(n_z - 1) * [ (n_z +1 ) b / n_x ] + n_x b = 0

Let me factor out b and n_x:

[ (n_z -1)(n_z +1) + n_x^2 ] * b / n_x = 0

Wait, n_x² + (n_z^2) = 1, because n is a unit vector. So n_x² = 1 - n_z^2.

So substituting:

( n_z² - 1 + n_x² ) * b / n_x = 0.

But n_z² + n_x² =1, so:

( (1 -1) ) * b /n_x = 0 → 0 * (b /n_x) )=0 → 0=0.

Which is always true, so the equations are consistent.

So from equation 2, a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b.

But we can express this in terms of an angle, perhaps. Since n is in the x-z plane, let me parameterize it using an angle θ. Let's say n_x = cosθ, and n_z = sinθ. Since it's in x-z plane, θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

Wait, or maybe I should let n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Then, our equations become:

a = [ (sinθ + 1 ) / cosθ ] b.

But wait, that's if n_x is not zero. So for n_x ≠ 0, we can proceed.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b, b ].

Let me factor out b, so the vector is [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ, 1 ] multiplied by b.

But to make it a normalized vector, we need to compute a and b such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

But wait, let's express the vector in terms of θ. Let’s let b = 1 for now, then a = (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

But wait, perhaps it's better to express in terms of θ/2, since I recall that spin-1/2 states can often be expressed using half-angle parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard parametrization for spin states. The state for spin-up along direction n (in x-z plane) is often written as ( cos(θ/2 ), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ), but since our n is in x-z plane, φ=0, so it's (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but in our case, the direction vector is n = (n_x, 0, n_z ) = (cosθ, 0, sinθ ), which is the same as spherical coordinates with φ=0. So the spin state should have components ( cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ), right?

Wait, no, that's when the direction is given by θ from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is measured from the z-axis. So perhaps I need to be careful here.

Wait, in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so it's pointing in the direction (n_x, 0, n_z). Let me think of this as a vector in the x-z plane: so from the x-axis, the angle would be θ, where θ is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So the usual parametrization in spherical coordinates is that the position vector (x,y,z) is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ ). But in this case, our vector is (n_x, 0, n_z ), which would correspond to φ=0, and θ being the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. For a direction in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it using an angle α where n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα. So α is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

So then, the angle α is the angle from x-axis in the x-z plane. So for example, when α=0, n is along x; when α=π/2, it's along +z.

Now, the eigenstate for spin-up along this direction would be ( cos(α/2 ), sin(α/2 ) ), but wait, no. Wait, the standard eigenstate for spin in the direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by:

|ψ> = ( cos(θ/2 ), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ) 

where θ is the polar angle (from z-axis) and φ is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, φ=0. So the state becomes ( cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2) ), where θ is measured from the z-axis.

But wait, in our parametrization, n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα. But if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ cosφ. But since φ=0, n_x = sinθ. So that would imply that θ is the angle from the z-axis. So in that case, our direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), because n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. Let me say that the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z ), which lies in the x-z plane. Let me define θ as the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cosθ, and n_z = sinθ. So the vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ ).

But in the standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So perhaps I should adjust. For our problem, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of the angle α where n_x = cosα and n_z = sinα, with α measured from x-axis.

So, given that, the eigenvector |ψ> should be:

|ψ> = [ a; b ]

Which has to satisfy the equation from earlier: 

a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b = [ ( sinα +1 ) / cosα ] b.

So a = [ (1 + sinα ) / cosα ] b.

But wait, let's express this in terms of a ratio. Let me write a = [ (1 + sinα ) / cosα ] * b.

So the vector is proportional to [ (1 + sinα ), cosα ].

Wait, but I can factor out cosα from the numerator.

Wait, (1 + sinα ) = 1 + sinα.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as (1 + sinα ) = 2 sin(α/2 + π/4 )^2?

Wait, maybe it's easier to express this ratio using trigonometric identities. Let me see:

(1 + sinα ) / cosα = [ sin(π/2) + sinα ] / cosα 

Using sum formula: sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]

So [sin(π/2) + sinα ] = 2 sin( (π/2 + α)/2 ) cos( (π/2 - α)/2 )

Which is 2 sin( (π + 2α)/4 ) cos( (π - 2α)/4 )

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as tan( (π/4 + α/2 ) ).

Wait, because:

(1 + sinα ) / cosα = [ (sin(π/2) + sinα ) ] / cosα 

Using the identity sin a + sin b = 2 sin( (a + b)/2 ) cos( (a - b)/2 )

So a = π/2, b = α.
So sin(π/2 ) + sinα = 2 sin( (π/2 + α)/2 ) cos( (π/2 - α)/2 )

Which simplifies to 2 sin( (π + 2α)/4 ) cos( (π - 2α)/4 )

But perhaps that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sinα ):

[ (1 + sinα ) (1 - sinα ) ] / [ cosα (1 - sinα ) ] 

Which becomes (1 - sin^2 α ) / [ cosα (1 - sinα ) ]

Since 1 - sin^2 α = cos^2 α, this becomes cos^2 α / [ cosα (1 - sinα ) ] = cos α / (1 - sin α )

Wait, but that’s getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a substitution. Let me set β = α/2, so α = 2β.

Then (1 + sinα ) / cosα = (1 + sin 2β ) / cos 2β

We can use the identities:

sin 2β = 2 sinβ cosβ

cos 2β = cos^2 β - sin^2 β = 1 - 2 sin^2 β

But perhaps it's better to write numerator and denominator in terms of sinβ and cosβ.

Wait, 1 + sin 2β = sin^2 β + cos^2 β + 2 sinβ cosβ = (sinβ + cosβ )^2.

And cos 2β = cos^2 β - sin^2 β = (cosβ - sinβ)(cosβ + sinβ )

So (1 + sin2β ) / cos 2β = [ (sinβ + cosβ )^2 ] / [ (cosβ - sinβ )(cosβ + sinβ ) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (sinβ + cosβ ) ] / ( cosβ - sinβ )

= [ (sinβ + cosβ ) ] / [ -( sinβ - cosβ ) ]

= - [ (sinβ + cosβ ) ] / ( sinβ - cosβ )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach: let's consider that our vector is [ a, b ] = [ [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b, b ]

Let me denote that as [ a, b ] = [ k b, b ], where k = (n_z +1 ) / n_x.

So the vector is (k b, b ) = b (k, 1 )

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1 → |k b |² + |b |² =1 → (k² +1 ) |b|² =1 → |b|= 1/√(k² +1 )

So the normalized vector is ( (k)/(√(k² +1 )) , 1/(√(k² +1 )) )

But let's compute k² +1:

k = (n_z +1 ) / n_x.

So k² +1 = [ (n_z +1 )² + n_x² ] / n_x².

Expanding numerator: n_z² + 2 n_z +1 + n_x².

But since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because it's a unit vector), the numerator becomes (1) + 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 + n_z )

So sqrt(k² +1 ) = sqrt( 2 (1 + n_z ) ) / |n_x | 

But since n_x is cosα, and we're considering α in the range where n_x is positive (i.e., the direction is in the right half of the x-z plane), so n_x is positive. So |n_x | = n_x.

So sqrt(k² +1 ) = sqrt( 2 (1 + n_z ) ) / n_x.

Now, the normalized vector is ( ( (n_z +1 ) / n_x ) * b, b ), with |b|=1/sqrt(k² +1 ).

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about another approach.

The eigenstate for spin-1/2 along (n_x, 0, n_z ) is ( cosθ, sinθ ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis. Wait, no, that's for the spin in the direction of the vector. Wait, maybe I should think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P·n.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the operator P·n is a 2x2 matrix, and we can find its eigenvectors.

The matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det( M - λ I ) = 0.

So,

det( [ [n_z - λ, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z - λ ] ] ) = 0.

Which gives (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - n_x² = 0.

Expanding:

(-n_z² - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ²) - n_x² = 0.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = -(n_z)(n_z + λ) + λ (n_z + λ )

Wait, better to compute it as (n_z -λ)(-n_z - λ) = -n_z^2 -n_z λ + λ n_z + λ² = -n_z² + λ².

So the determinant equation is:

(-n_z^2 + λ^2 ) - n_x^2 = 0 → λ^2 = n_z^2 +n_x^2.

But since n_x² +n_z^2=1, λ^2=1 → λ= ±1.

But the eigenvalues are multiplied by (ħ/2), so the actual eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvectors correspond to these two eigenvalues.

We're interested in the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which corresponds to λ=1.

So the equation (M - (ħ/2) *1 I ) |ψ> =0.

Wait, M is (ħ/2) times the matrix. So the eigenvalue equation is M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so the matrix equation is (M - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> =0.

So the matrix M - (ħ/2) I is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ] - (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,1]].

Which is (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ].

So the equations are:

(n_z -1 ) a + n_x b =0

n_x a + ( -n_z -1 ) b =0

From the first equation: a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b.

Substituting into second equation:

n_x [ n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b + (-n_z -1 ) b =0 → [ n_x² / (1 -n_z ) - (n_z +1 ) ] b =0.

Let me compute the coefficient:

n_x² / (1 -n_z ) - (n_z +1 )

But n_x² = 1 -n_z^2, since n_x² +n_z²=1.

Substituting:

(1 -n_z^2 ) / (1 -n_z )  - (n_z +1 )

= ( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) ) / (1 -n_z ) ) - (n_z +1 )

= (1 +n_z ) - (n_z +1 ) = 0.

So the equations are consistent, and the eigenvectors are proportional to [ a, b ] = [ n_x, (1 -n_z ) ].

Wait, because a = [n_x/(1 -n_z ) ] b → let me choose b = (1 -n_z ), then a= n_x.

So the eigenvector is [n_x, (1 -n_z ) ].

But wait, wait, no. Because a = [n_x/(1 -n_z ) ] b → if I set b = (1 -n_z ), then a =n_x.

So the vector is [n_x, 1 -n_z ], which can be written as (n_x, 1 -n_z ).

But to normalize, we need to find the norm of this vector.

Compute |n_x |² + |1 -n_z |².

But n_x² =1 -n_z².

So |n_x |² is (1 -n_z² ), and |1 -n_z |² is (1 - 2n_z +n_z² ).

Adding them: 1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z² = 2 -2n_z.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z )).

So the normalized eigenvector is [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) , (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) ].

Simplify the components:

a = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) 

b = (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

Wait, but wait, 1 -n_z =1 - sinα, assuming n_z = sinα (since earlier we had n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα. Wait, no. Wait, earlier I considered n_x = cosθ, but perhaps I should re-examine that.

Wait, earlier I thought of n as (n_x, 0, n_z ), and if it's in the x-z plane, then n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα, where α is the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα.

So substituting into the eigenvector components:

a = cosα / sqrt(2(1 - sinα )) 

b = (1 - sinα ) / sqrt(2(1 - sinα )) = sqrt( (1 - sinα ) / 2 )

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this.

Let me compute 1 - sinα as 2 sin^2 ( π/4 - α/2 )

Because 1 - sinα = 2 sin^2( (π/4) - α/2 )

So sqrt( (1 - sinα ) / 2 ) = sin( (π/4 - α/2 ) )

Similarly, cosα = sqrt( 2 ) [ sin( π/4 + α/2 ) cos( π/4 - α/2 ) ] ? Not sure, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let me express the numerator and denominator in terms of cos(α/2) and sin(α/2).

Wait, 1 - sinα = (sin(π/2) ) - sinα = 2 cos( (π/4 + α/2 ) ) sin( (π/4 - α/2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a and b in terms of α/2.

Let me think: 1 - sinα = 2 sin^2( (π/4 - α/2 ) )

So sqrt( (1 - sinα ) / 2 ) ) = sin( π/4 - α/2 )

Similarly, cosα = 1 - 2 sin^2 (α/2 )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to write the eigenvector in terms of α/2.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate the eigenvector components:

a = cosα / sqrt(2(1 - sinα )) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 + sinα ):

a = [ cosα * sqrt(1 + sinα ) ] / sqrt( 2 (1 - sinα ) (1 + sinα ) )

Denominator: sqrt( 2 (1 - sin^2 α ) ) = sqrt(2 cos^2 α ) = sqrt(2) |cos alpha |. Since we are considering alpha in the range where cos alpha is positive (i.e., alpha between -pi/2 and pi/2), we can drop the absolute value.

So denominator is sqrt(2) cos alpha.

So a becomes [ cos alpha * sqrt(1 + sin alpha ) ] / ( sqrt(2) cos alpha ) ) → sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) ) / sqrt(2 )

So a = sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, the other component b is sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) ]

Hmm, this looks familiar. Let me express this in terms of trigonometric identities.

Note that:

(1 + sin alpha ) / 2 = sin^2 ( alpha/2 + pi/4 )

Wait, because:

sin^2(theta) = (1 - cos 2theta ) / 2. That's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps write in terms of cos and sin of alpha/2.

Wait, another approach: Let me let beta = alpha/2.

Then, alpha = 2 beta.

So 1 + sin alpha = 1 + 2 sin beta cos beta = (sin beta + cos beta )^2.

So sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ) = (sin beta + cos beta ) / sqrt(2 )

Which can be written as sqrt(1/2) ( sin beta + cos beta )

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) = sqrt( (1 - 2 sin beta cos beta ) / 2 ) 

= sqrt( ( sin^2 beta + cos^2 beta - 2 sin beta cos beta ) / 2 )

= sqrt( ( (sin beta - cos beta )^2 ) / 2 )

= | sin beta - cos beta | / sqrt(2 )

But since alpha is between 0 and pi, beta is between 0 and pi/2, so sin beta and cos beta are positive. Depending on beta, sin beta - cos beta can be positive or negative.

But for beta < pi/4, cos beta > sin beta → sin beta - cos beta <0 → so the absolute value would make it cos beta - sin beta.

But perhaps it's better to write it as (cos beta - sin beta ) / sqrt(2 ), but only when beta < pi/4. But perhaps for the general case, it's better to use the exponential form.

Wait, another approach: Remember that (sin beta + cos beta ) = sqrt(2 ) sin (beta + pi/4 ), and (cos beta - sin beta ) = sqrt(2 ) cos (beta + pi/4 )

So sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ) = [ sqrt(2 ) sin (beta + pi/4 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ) = sin( beta + pi/4 )

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) = [ sqrt(2 ) cos (beta + pi/4 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ) = cos( beta + pi/4 )

So the eigenvector components become:

[ sin (beta + pi/4 ), cos (beta + pi/4 ) ]

But beta = alpha/2, so beta + pi/4 = alpha/2 + pi/4.

So the eigenvector is:

[ sin( alpha/2 + pi/4 ), cos( alpha/2 + pi/4 ) ]

Wait, but this can also be written in terms of a phase shift. Alternatively, perhaps expressing it in terms of theta, the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, earlier I was considering the direction vector n as (n_x, 0, n_z ) = (cos alpha, 0, sin alpha ), where alpha is the angle from x-axis towards z-axis. But in spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so perhaps I should relate alpha and theta.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, n_x = sin theta cos phi, n_z = cos theta.

But in our case, phi=0, so n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

So alpha is the angle from x-axis, which in spherical coordinates would be theta_s (the polar angle from z-axis) is given by theta_s = pi/2 - alpha.

Because when alpha=0, n is along x (theta_s=pi/2), and when alpha=pi/2, n is along z (theta_s=0).

So in terms of theta_s (the polar angle from z-axis):

alpha = pi/2 - theta_s.

So beta = alpha/2 = (pi/2 - theta_s )/2 = pi/4 - theta_s / 2.

So beta + pi/4 = pi/4 - theta_s/2 + pi/4 = pi/2 - theta_s/2.

So the eigenvector components are:

sin( pi/2 - theta_s/2 ) = cos(theta_s/2 )

and 

cos( pi/2 - theta_s/2 ) = sin(theta_s/2 )

So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta_s/2 ), sin(theta_s/2 ) ].

Wait, that's a much cleaner result.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but earlier I thought the direction was parameterized as (cos alpha, 0, sin alpha ), but that's not the standard spherical coordinate parametrization. Let me clarify this.

If n is (n_x, 0, n_z ) and lies in the x-z plane, then in spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta (from z-axis) satisfies n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta. Because in spherical coordinates, x = r sin theta cos phi, y= ..., z= r cos theta.

So if n is a unit vector in x-z plane, phi=0, so x = sin theta, z= cos theta.

So theta here is the angle from the z-axis, so the polar angle.

So if our direction vector is n = (sin theta, 0, cos theta ), then the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ).

Wait, but earlier I derived that the eigenvector is ( cos(theta_s/2 ), sin(theta_s/2 ) ), where theta_s is the polar angle from the z-axis.

But in the problem statement, the direction is given as an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, which we've parameterized as (n_x, 0, n_z ) = (sin theta, 0, cos theta ), theta being the polar angle from z-axis.

So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ).

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options given are:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Option B: ( cos(theta ), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

But since in our case, phi=0, because the direction is in x-z plane, so the state would be ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), which matches option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). So that's exactly what I have.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), which is option C.

Looking at the other options:

Option B: (cos(theta ), e^{i phi} sin(theta )). But in this problem, phi=0, so it's (cos(theta ), sin(theta )). But our result is in terms of theta/2, so B is not correct.

Option A and D involve sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't seem to align with our result.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any factors. Let me re-examine the eigenvector calculation.

Wait, the normalized eigenvector I found is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ). But in our earlier calculation, the eigenvector came out as ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), so that should be correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as $\hbar/2$ times specific 2x2 matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**: The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z,
   \]
   where:
   \[
   P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Substituting $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, the matrix becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**: The eigenvalue equation leads to the system of equations:
   \[
   n_z a + n_x b = a, \quad n_x a - n_z b = b.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} \propto \begin{bmatrix} n_x \\ 1 - n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is normalized by enforcing:
   \[
   |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
   \]
   Substituting $a = n_x$ and $b = 1 - n_z$, the normalization condition gives:
   \[
   \sqrt{n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2} = \sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}.
   \]
   The normalized eigenvector becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Trigonometric Parametrization**: Using the parametrization $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis), the eigenvector simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\frac{\theta}{2} \\ \sin\frac{\theta}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$ matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$ introduces incorrect normalization factors.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Hmm, so I know that in quantum mechanics, the operator for angular momentum along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator P·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

Wait, right. So the operator in question is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. And we need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

But wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I'm looking for a state |ψ> such that (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

I remember that the eigenstates of angular momentum along an arbitrary direction are called eigenstates of the angular momentum operator and they can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics or in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but since P is a spin-1/2 operator, the eigenvectors will be two-component spinors. So the eigenvector should have two components, let's say (a, b), which we'll need to normalize.

First, let's write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], so it's [[0, -i ħ/2], [i ħ/2, 0]].

And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which gives [[ħ/2, 0],[0, -ħ/2]].

So the operator P·n is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since direction vector n lies in x-z plane, its y-component (n_y) is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. So n_y=0, and n is (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P·n becomes (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

Substituting the matrices, that would be:

n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) times:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this 2x2 matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So we have the equation (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me denote |ψ> as a two-component vector (a, b). Then, applying the operator matrix to |ψ> should give (ħ/2) times |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

( (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

So the two equations are:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

Let me write equation 2 as:

n_x a = (n_z + 1) b → a = [ (n_z + 1) / n_x ] b, assuming n_x ≠ 0.

Substitute a into equation 1:

(n_z - 1) * [ (n_z +1 ) b / n_x ] + n_x b = 0

Let me factor out b and n_x:

[ (n_z -1)(n_z +1) + n_x^2 ] * b / n_x = 0

Wait, n_x² + (n_z^2) = 1, because n is a unit vector. So n_x² = 1 - n_z^2.

So substituting:

( n_z² - 1 + n_x² ) * b / n_x = 0.

But n_z² + n_x² =1, so:

( (1 -1) ) * b /n_x = 0 → 0 * (b /n_x) )=0 → 0=0.

Which is always true, so the equations are consistent.

So from equation 2, a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b.

But we can express this in terms of an angle, perhaps. Since n is in the x-z plane, let me parameterize it using an angle θ. Let's say n_x = cosθ, and n_z = sinθ. Since it's in x-z plane, θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

Wait, or maybe I should let n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Then, our equations become:

a = [ (sinθ + 1 ) / cosθ ] b.

But wait, that's if n_x is not zero. So for n_x ≠ 0, we can proceed.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b, b ].

Let me factor out b, so the vector is [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ, 1 ] multiplied by b.

But to make it a normalized vector, we need to compute a and b such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

But wait, let's express the vector in terms of θ. Let’s let b = 1 for now, then a = (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

But wait, perhaps it's better to express in terms of θ/2, since I recall that spin-1/2 states can often be expressed using half-angle parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard parametrization for spin states. The state for spin-up along direction n (in x-z plane) is often written as ( cos(θ/2 ), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ), but since our n is in x-z plane, φ=0, so it's (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but in our case, the direction vector is n = (n_x, 0, n_z ) = (cosθ, 0, sinθ ), which is the same as spherical coordinates with φ=0. So the spin state should have components ( cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ), right?

Wait, no, that's when the direction is given by θ from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is measured from the z-axis. So perhaps I need to be careful here.

Wait, in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so it's pointing in the direction (n_x, 0, n_z). Let me think of this as a vector in the x-z plane: so from the x-axis, the angle would be θ, where θ is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So the usual parametrization in spherical coordinates is that the position vector (x,y,z) is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ ). But in this case, our vector is (n_x, 0, n_z ), which would correspond to φ=0, and θ being the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. For a direction in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it using an angle α where n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα. So α is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

So then, the angle α is the angle from x-axis in the x-z plane. So for example, when α=0, n is along x; when α=π/2, it's along +z.

Now, the eigenstate for spin-up along this direction would be ( cos(α/2 ), sin(α/2 ) ), but wait, no. Wait, the standard eigenstate for spin in the direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by:

|ψ> = ( cos(θ/2 ), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ) 

where θ is the polar angle (from z-axis) and φ is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, φ=0. So the state becomes ( cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2) ), where θ is measured from the z-axis.

But wait, in our parametrization, n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα. But if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ cosφ. But since φ=0, n_x = sinθ. So that would imply that θ is the angle from the z-axis. So in that case, our direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), because n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. Let me say that the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z ), which lies in the x-z plane. Let me define θ as the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cosθ, and n_z = sinθ. So the vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ ).

But in the standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So perhaps I should adjust. For our problem, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of the angle α where n_x = cosα and n_z = sinα, with α measured from x-axis.

So, given that, the eigenvector |ψ> should be:

|ψ> = [ a; b ]

Which has to satisfy the equation from earlier: 

a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b = [ ( sinα +1 ) / cosα ] b.

So a = [ (1 + sinα ) / cosα ] b.

But wait, let's express this in terms of a ratio. Let me write a = [ (1 + sinα ) / cosα ] * b.

So the vector is proportional to [ (1 + sinα ), cosα ].

Wait, but I can factor out cosα from the numerator.

Wait, (1 + sinα ) = 1 + sinα.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as (1 + sinα ) = 2 sin(α/2 + π/4 )^2?

Wait, maybe it's easier to express this ratio using trigonometric identities. Let me see:

(1 + sinα ) / cosα = [ sin(π/2) + sinα ] / cosα 

Using sum formula: sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]

So [sin(π/2) + sinα ] = 2 sin( (π/2 + α)/2 ) cos( (π/2 - α)/2 )

Which is 2 sin( (π + 2α)/4 ) cos( (π - 2α)/4 )

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as tan( (π/4 + α/2 ) ).

Wait, because:

(1 + sinα ) / cosα = [ (sin(π/2) + sinα ) ] / cosα 

Using the identity sin a + sin b = 2 sin( (a + b)/2 ) cos( (a - b)/2 )

So a = π/2, b = α.
So sin(π/2 ) + sinα = 2 sin( (π/2 + α)/2 ) cos( (π/2 - α)/2 )

Which simplifies to 2 sin( (π + 2α)/4 ) cos( (π - 2α)/4 )

But perhaps that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sinα ):

[ (1 + sinα ) (1 - sinα ) ] / [ cosα (1 - sinα ) ] 

Which becomes (1 - sin^2 α ) / [ cosα (1 - sinα ) ]

Since 1 - sin^2 α = cos^2 α, this becomes cos^2 α / [ cosα (1 - sinα ) ] = cos α / (1 - sin α )

Wait, but that’s getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a substitution. Let me set β = α/2, so α = 2β.

Then (1 + sinα ) / cosα = (1 + sin 2β ) / cos 2β

We can use the identities:

sin 2β = 2 sinβ cosβ

cos 2β = cos^2 β - sin^2 β = 1 - 2 sin^2 β

But perhaps it's better to write numerator and denominator in terms of sinβ and cosβ.

Wait, 1 + sin 2β = sin^2 β + cos^2 β + 2 sinβ cosβ = (sinβ + cosβ )^2.

And cos 2β = cos^2 β - sin^2 β = (cosβ - sinβ)(cosβ + sinβ )

So (1 + sin2β ) / cos 2β = [ (sinβ + cosβ )^2 ] / [ (cosβ - sinβ )(cosβ + sinβ ) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (sinβ + cosβ ) ] / ( cosβ - sinβ )

= [ (sinβ + cosβ ) ] / [ -( sinβ - cosβ ) ]

= - [ (sinβ + cosβ ) ] / ( sinβ - cosβ )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach: let's consider that our vector is [ a, b ] = [ [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b, b ]

Let me denote that as [ a, b ] = [ k b, b ], where k = (n_z +1 ) / n_x.

So the vector is (k b, b ) = b (k, 1 )

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1 → |k b |² + |b |² =1 → (k² +1 ) |b|² =1 → |b|= 1/√(k² +1 )

So the normalized vector is ( (k)/(√(k² +1 )) , 1/(√(k² +1 )) )

But let's compute k² +1:

k = (n_z +1 ) / n_x.

So k² +1 = [ (n_z +1 )² + n_x² ] / n_x².

Expanding numerator: n_z² + 2 n_z +1 + n_x².

But since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because it's a unit vector), the numerator becomes (1) + 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 + n_z )

So sqrt(k² +1 ) = sqrt( 2 (1 + n_z ) ) / |n_x | 

But since n_x is cosα, and we're considering α in the range where n_x is positive (i.e., the direction is in the right half of the x-z plane), so n_x is positive. So |n_x | = n_x.

So sqrt(k² +1 ) = sqrt( 2 (1 + n_z ) ) / n_x.

Now, the normalized vector is ( ( (n_z +1 ) / n_x ) * b, b ), with |b|=1/sqrt(k² +1 ).

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about another approach.

The eigenstate for spin-1/2 along (n_x, 0, n_z ) is ( cosθ, sinθ ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis. Wait, no, that's for the spin in the direction of the vector. Wait, maybe I should think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P·n.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the operator P·n is a 2x2 matrix, and we can find its eigenvectors.

The matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det( M - λ I ) = 0.

So,

det( [ [n_z - λ, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z - λ ] ] ) = 0.

Which gives (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - n_x² = 0.

Expanding:

(-n_z² - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ²) - n_x² = 0.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = -(n_z)(n_z + λ) + λ (n_z + λ )

Wait, better to compute it as (n_z -λ)(-n_z - λ) = -n_z^2 -n_z λ + λ n_z + λ² = -n_z² + λ².

So the determinant equation is:

(-n_z^2 + λ^2 ) - n_x^2 = 0 → λ^2 = n_z^2 +n_x^2.

But since n_x² +n_z^2=1, λ^2=1 → λ= ±1.

But the eigenvalues are multiplied by (ħ/2), so the actual eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvectors correspond to these two eigenvalues.

We're interested in the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which corresponds to λ=1.

So the equation (M - (ħ/2) *1 I ) |ψ> =0.

Wait, M is (ħ/2) times the matrix. So the eigenvalue equation is M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so the matrix equation is (M - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> =0.

So the matrix M - (ħ/2) I is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ] - (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,1]].

Which is (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ].

So the equations are:

(n_z -1 ) a + n_x b =0

n_x a + ( -n_z -1 ) b =0

From the first equation: a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b.

Substituting into second equation:

n_x [ n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b + (-n_z -1 ) b =0 → [ n_x² / (1 -n_z ) - (n_z +1 ) ] b =0.

Let me compute the coefficient:

n_x² / (1 -n_z ) - (n_z +1 )

But n_x² = 1 -n_z^2, since n_x² +n_z²=1.

Substituting:

(1 -n_z^2 ) / (1 -n_z )  - (n_z +1 )

= ( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) ) / (1 -n_z ) ) - (n_z +1 )

= (1 +n_z ) - (n_z +1 ) = 0.

So the equations are consistent, and the eigenvectors are proportional to [ a, b ] = [ n_x, (1 -n_z ) ].

Wait, because a = [n_x/(1 -n_z ) ] b → let me choose b = (1 -n_z ), then a= n_x.

So the eigenvector is [n_x, (1 -n_z ) ].

But wait, wait, no. Because a = [n_x/(1 -n_z ) ] b → if I set b = (1 -n_z ), then a =n_x.

So the vector is [n_x, 1 -n_z ], which can be written as (n_x, 1 -n_z ).

But to normalize, we need to find the norm of this vector.

Compute |n_x |² + |1 -n_z |².

But n_x² =1 -n_z².

So |n_x |² is (1 -n_z² ), and |1 -n_z |² is (1 - 2n_z +n_z² ).

Adding them: 1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z² = 2 -2n_z.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z )).

So the normalized eigenvector is [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) , (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) ].

Simplify the components:

a = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) 

b = (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

Wait, but wait, 1 -n_z =1 - sinα, assuming n_z = sinα (since earlier we had n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα. Wait, no. Wait, earlier I considered n_x = cosθ, but perhaps I should re-examine that.

Wait, earlier I thought of n as (n_x, 0, n_z ), and if it's in the x-z plane, then n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα, where α is the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cosα, n_z = sinα.

So substituting into the eigenvector components:

a = cosα / sqrt(2(1 - sinα )) 

b = (1 - sinα ) / sqrt(2(1 - sinα )) = sqrt( (1 - sinα ) / 2 )

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this.

Let me compute 1 - sinα as 2 sin^2 ( π/4 - α/2 )

Because 1 - sinα = 2 sin^2( (π/4) - α/2 )

So sqrt( (1 - sinα ) / 2 ) = sin( (π/4 - α/2 ) )

Similarly, cosα = sqrt( 2 ) [ sin( π/4 + α/2 ) cos( π/4 - α/2 ) ] ? Not sure, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let me express the numerator and denominator in terms of cos(α/2) and sin(α/2).

Wait, 1 - sinα = (sin(π/2) ) - sinα = 2 cos( (π/4 + α/2 ) ) sin( (π/4 - α/2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a and b in terms of α/2.

Let me think: 1 - sinα = 2 sin^2( (π/4 - α/2 ) )

So sqrt( (1 - sinα ) / 2 ) ) = sin( π/4 - α/2 )

Similarly, cosα = 1 - 2 sin^2 (α/2 )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to write the eigenvector in terms of α/2.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate the eigenvector components:

a = cosα / sqrt(2(1 - sinα )) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 + sinα ):

a = [ cosα * sqrt(1 + sinα ) ] / sqrt( 2 (1 - sinα ) (1 + sinα ) )

Denominator: sqrt( 2 (1 - sin^2 α ) ) = sqrt(2 cos^2 α ) = sqrt(2) |cos alpha |. Since we are considering alpha in the range where cos alpha is positive (i.e., alpha between -pi/2 and pi/2), we can drop the absolute value.

So denominator is sqrt(2) cos alpha.

So a becomes [ cos alpha * sqrt(1 + sin alpha ) ] / ( sqrt(2) cos alpha ) ) → sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) ) / sqrt(2 )

So a = sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, the other component b is sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) ]

Hmm, this looks familiar. Let me express this in terms of trigonometric identities.

Note that:

(1 + sin alpha ) / 2 = sin^2 ( alpha/2 + pi/4 )

Wait, because:

sin^2(theta) = (1 - cos 2theta ) / 2. That's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps write in terms of cos and sin of alpha/2.

Wait, another approach: Let me let beta = alpha/2.

Then, alpha = 2 beta.

So 1 + sin alpha = 1 + 2 sin beta cos beta = (sin beta + cos beta )^2.

So sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ) = (sin beta + cos beta ) / sqrt(2 )

Which can be written as sqrt(1/2) ( sin beta + cos beta )

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) = sqrt( (1 - 2 sin beta cos beta ) / 2 ) 

= sqrt( ( sin^2 beta + cos^2 beta - 2 sin beta cos beta ) / 2 )

= sqrt( ( (sin beta - cos beta )^2 ) / 2 )

= | sin beta - cos beta | / sqrt(2 )

But since alpha is between 0 and pi, beta is between 0 and pi/2, so sin beta and cos beta are positive. Depending on beta, sin beta - cos beta can be positive or negative.

But for beta < pi/4, cos beta > sin beta → sin beta - cos beta <0 → so the absolute value would make it cos beta - sin beta.

But perhaps it's better to write it as (cos beta - sin beta ) / sqrt(2 ), but only when beta < pi/4. But perhaps for the general case, it's better to use the exponential form.

Wait, another approach: Remember that (sin beta + cos beta ) = sqrt(2 ) sin (beta + pi/4 ), and (cos beta - sin beta ) = sqrt(2 ) cos (beta + pi/4 )

So sqrt( (1 + sin alpha ) / 2 ) = [ sqrt(2 ) sin (beta + pi/4 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ) = sin( beta + pi/4 )

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin alpha ) / 2 ) = [ sqrt(2 ) cos (beta + pi/4 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ) = cos( beta + pi/4 )

So the eigenvector components become:

[ sin (beta + pi/4 ), cos (beta + pi/4 ) ]

But beta = alpha/2, so beta + pi/4 = alpha/2 + pi/4.

So the eigenvector is:

[ sin( alpha/2 + pi/4 ), cos( alpha/2 + pi/4 ) ]

Wait, but this can also be written in terms of a phase shift. Alternatively, perhaps expressing it in terms of theta, the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, earlier I was considering the direction vector n as (n_x, 0, n_z ) = (cos alpha, 0, sin alpha ), where alpha is the angle from x-axis towards z-axis. But in spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so perhaps I should relate alpha and theta.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, n_x = sin theta cos phi, n_z = cos theta.

But in our case, phi=0, so n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

So alpha is the angle from x-axis, which in spherical coordinates would be theta_s (the polar angle from z-axis) is given by theta_s = pi/2 - alpha.

Because when alpha=0, n is along x (theta_s=pi/2), and when alpha=pi/2, n is along z (theta_s=0).

So in terms of theta_s (the polar angle from z-axis):

alpha = pi/2 - theta_s.

So beta = alpha/2 = (pi/2 - theta_s )/2 = pi/4 - theta_s / 2.

So beta + pi/4 = pi/4 - theta_s/2 + pi/4 = pi/2 - theta_s/2.

So the eigenvector components are:

sin( pi/2 - theta_s/2 ) = cos(theta_s/2 )

and 

cos( pi/2 - theta_s/2 ) = sin(theta_s/2 )

So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta_s/2 ), sin(theta_s/2 ) ].

Wait, that's a much cleaner result.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but earlier I thought the direction was parameterized as (cos alpha, 0, sin alpha ), but that's not the standard spherical coordinate parametrization. Let me clarify this.

If n is (n_x, 0, n_z ) and lies in the x-z plane, then in spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta (from z-axis) satisfies n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta. Because in spherical coordinates, x = r sin theta cos phi, y= ..., z= r cos theta.

So if n is a unit vector in x-z plane, phi=0, so x = sin theta, z= cos theta.

So theta here is the angle from the z-axis, so the polar angle.

So if our direction vector is n = (sin theta, 0, cos theta ), then the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ).

Wait, but earlier I derived that the eigenvector is ( cos(theta_s/2 ), sin(theta_s/2 ) ), where theta_s is the polar angle from the z-axis.

But in the problem statement, the direction is given as an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, which we've parameterized as (n_x, 0, n_z ) = (sin theta, 0, cos theta ), theta being the polar angle from z-axis.

So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ).

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options given are:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Option B: ( cos(theta ), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

But since in our case, phi=0, because the direction is in x-z plane, so the state would be ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), which matches option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). So that's exactly what I have.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), which is option C.

Looking at the other options:

Option B: (cos(theta ), e^{i phi} sin(theta )). But in this problem, phi=0, so it's (cos(theta ), sin(theta )). But our result is in terms of theta/2, so B is not correct.

Option A and D involve sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't seem to align with our result.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any factors. Let me re-examine the eigenvector calculation.

Wait, the normalized eigenvector I found is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ). But in our earlier calculation, the eigenvector came out as ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), so that should be correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as $\hbar/2$ times specific 2x2 matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**: The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z,
   \]
   where:
   \[
   P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Substituting $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, the matrix becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**: The eigenvalue equation leads to the system of equations:
   \[
   n_z a + n_x b = a, \quad n_x a - n_z b = b.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} \propto \begin{bmatrix} n_x \\ 1 - n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is normalized by enforcing:
   \[
   |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
   \]
   Substituting $a = n_x$ and $b = 1 - n_z$, the normalization condition gives:
   \[
   \sqrt{n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2} = \sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}.
   \]
   The normalized eigenvector becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Trigonometric Parametrization**: Using the parametrization $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis), the eigenvector simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\frac{\theta}{2} \\ \sin\frac{\theta}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$ matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$ introduces incorrect normalization factors.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2})$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
