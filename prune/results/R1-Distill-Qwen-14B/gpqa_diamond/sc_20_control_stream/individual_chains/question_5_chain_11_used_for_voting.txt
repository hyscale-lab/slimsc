Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're provided with the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices for Px, Py, and Pz. The goal is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for the spin component along a direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the vector n. Since the muon is a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S would be ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. But wait, the operator P here is given, and it's probably representing the spin operator. Or perhaps it's a momentum operator? Wait, the question mentions it's a quantum mechanical operator for a muon, which is a spin-½ particle. So I think P is the spin operator.

The operator components are given as matrices. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the standard Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So, the components of the operator P are given in terms of the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator in the arbitrary direction n. Oh right, so the operator for the spin along a direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero, right? Because the x-z plane is where y=0. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So the operator P simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction vector n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out. Since each component (P_x, P_z) is multiplied by n_x and n_z respectively.

So P = n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the two matrices:

P_x part gives [ [0, n_x], [n_x, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.
P_z part gives [ [n_z, 0], [0, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Adding them together, we get the matrix as above.

Now, we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the matrix P, when multiplied by the eigenvector, gives (ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

So, to find the eigenvector, we can set up the equation (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I):

P is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So, (P - (ħ/2) I) would be (ħ/2)([n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]) - (ħ/2) I.

Which is (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1] ]

Wait, no. Let me compute each element:

Top-left: (ħ/2) n_z - ħ/2 *1 = (ħ/2)(n_z -1)
Top-right: (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom-left: (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom-right: (ħ/2)(-n_z) - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(-n_z -1)

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x],
         [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

But perhaps it's easier to write the equation without the factor of ħ/2. Let me factor that out.

So the equation is:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x      ] [a]   = 0
[   n_x    (-n_z -1) ] [b]

Here, a and b are the components of the eigenvector |v> = [a; b].

So the system of equations is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These two equations must hold for non-trivial solutions (a,b not zero). So, for the system to have non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

But perhaps it's easier to solve one equation and express a in terms of b, or vice versa.

Looking at the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 --> (n_z -1) a = -n_x b --> a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Hmm, but I can think in terms of direction. Let me parameterize the direction vector n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, which implies that n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Let me represent n using spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because for the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is between 0 and π/2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the positive z-axis. But for the x-z plane, it's more convenient to define θ as the angle from the x-axis. Oh, perhaps it's better to define it as the angle from the x-axis, so that n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Because then, when θ=0, the direction is along x; θ=π/2, along z.

So, substituting n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ.

So, substituting into a:

a = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1) ] b

Wait, let me compute the denominator: (n_z -1) = sinθ -1.

Hmm, maybe simplifying this expression.

Let me factor out a negative sign: sinθ - 1 = -(1 - sinθ)

So,

a = [ - cosθ ] / ( - (1 - sinθ) ) * b

The negatives cancel, so:

a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] * b

Hmm, perhaps we can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ) to rationalize.

So,

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] * b

Denominator becomes 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So,

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / cos²θ * b

Simplify:

a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * b

So,

a = (1 + sinθ) / cosθ * b

Alternatively, a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b

So, the ratio a/b is (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

Hmm, let me write this as [ (1 + sinθ) ] / cosθ = [ (1/cosθ) + (sinθ/cosθ) ) ] = secθ + tanθ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express a as this ratio times b.

Wait, but perhaps we can find a better way to express this. Let me think about the eigenvector.

Another approach: Let's think about the eigenvector for the spin in direction n. For spin-½ particles, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.

The spin-up state for direction n can be written as a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis.

The general form is |+n> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>, but wait, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so no y-component. So, for n in x-z plane, φ=0. So the state simplifies to cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought n_x = cosθ, but perhaps in the spherical system, θ is the angle from the z-axis. Let me double-check.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ (the azimuthal angle) is 0 or π. So, for example, along the x-axis, φ=0, θ=π/2. Along the z-axis, φ=0, θ=0.

So, if n is in the x-z plane, and making an angle θ from the z-axis, then n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, wait, that's a different approach. Let me be precise.

In spherical coordinates, a unit vector n can be written as:

n = ( sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ )

So, when in the x-z plane, φ=0, so n = ( sinθ, 0, cosθ )

But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So, substituting φ=0, we have n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me see: when θ=0, the direction is along +z. So, n_x=0, n_z=1. Correct. When θ=90 degrees (π/2 radians), the direction is along +x. So, n_x=1, n_z=0. Correct.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, earlier I thought n_x was cosθ. But perhaps I got that wrong. So this is a point to clarify.

So, given that, the operator P is in the direction n, which is (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, putting that into the matrix P:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_z  n_x
           n_x  -n_z ]

So,

P = (ħ/2) [ cosθ    sinθ
           sinθ   -cosθ ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the matrix equation is:

( P - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0

Which is:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ     sinθ      ]   [a]
        [ sinθ   -cosθ ]   [b]
          - (ħ/2) I becomes subtracting (ħ/2) times identity matrix.

So,

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1)   sinθ        ] [a]   = 0
        [  sinθ     (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

Factor out (ħ/2):

[ (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b ] = 0
[ sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b ] = 0

So, let's write the equations:

1. (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ), so:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Wait, this can be simplified using trigonometric identities. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

Simplify: numerator and denominator both have 2 sin(theta/2), so they cancel.

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b

So a = cot(theta/2) b

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T

But wait, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, we can choose b = 1 for simplicity, but we need to normalize the vector.

Wait, but wait, the direction of the eigenvector will depend on the choice of b. Alternatively, to find the normalized eigenvector, we can let b be a normalization factor.

Let me compute the components a and b in terms of theta.

Let me express a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ]

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and we're dealing with spin-½, the eigenvectors are normalized.

Wait, but let's compute it. Let me choose b = 1 for simplicity, but then normalize.

Wait, no, let me write the components in terms of a normalization factor.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write the eigenvector as:

|v> = [ a; b ]

With a = cot(theta/2) b.

So, substituting:

|v> = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ]

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2)|² |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ]

But cot^2 x +1 = csc^2 x = 1 / sin² x.

So, norm squared is |b|² (1 / sin²(theta/2) )

We want the norm to be 1, so:

|b|² (1 / sin²(theta/2) ) ) = 1 → |b|² = sin²(theta/2) → |b|= sin(theta/2)

Since we're dealing with normalized eigenvectors, we can take b = sin(theta/2), and a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Wait, let's compute:

If b = sin(theta/2), then:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

So, the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, wait! Because in our earlier substitution, we have a = cot(theta/2) * b, which in this case is cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second: the original equations were for spin-up state along direction n. So, the spin-up state should be along n, which is in the x-z plane. So, the eigenvector should be a combination of the standard basis states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, in the standard z-basis, |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So, the eigenvector for spin-up along n is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector elements. Are the options in terms of the components?

But wait, the options I remember are:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
Option D: [√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, no, let me look back at the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but our result is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as the eigenvector. So that's option C.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So that would be option C.

Wait, but let me think about the direction. Because the direction vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so theta is the angle from the z-axis. So when theta is 0, we're along +z.

But the eigenvector in the spin-up state along +z is [1; 0], which is cos(0/2) = 1, sin(0/2)=0. So that's correct.

When theta is 90 degrees, n is along x, so the eigenvector is [cos(45), sin(45)] = [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct for spin-up along x.

So the answer must be option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but wait, the question says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?".

But the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is already normalized, since cos² + sin² =1.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it has components $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

Substituting the given matrices, $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( \vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]

Substituting $\vec{P}$ and $I$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]

Factoring out $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the system of equations is:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0
\]

To solve this, we parameterize $\vec{n}$ in spherical coordinates. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, and $\vec{n}$ can be written as:

\[
n_x = \sin\theta, \quad n_z = \cos\theta
\]

Substituting these into the equations, we find:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0
\]

From the first equation:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

To normalize, we compute the norm:

\[
\| |v\rangle \|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = \cot^2(\theta/2) |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 \left( \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 \right)
\]

Using $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, we find:

\[
|b| = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

Substituting this back, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This matches option **C**, which states $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A**: Incorrect normalization and dependence on $\hbar$.  
- **B**: Includes an $e^{i\phi}$ term, which is unnecessary since $\phi = 0$ for $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.  
- **D**: Incorrectly includes $\sqrt{2/3}\hbar$ and $\sqrt{1/3}\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're provided with the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices for Px, Py, and Pz. The goal is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for the spin component along a direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the vector n. Since the muon is a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S would be ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. But wait, the operator P here is given, and it's probably representing the spin operator. Or perhaps it's a momentum operator? Wait, the question mentions it's a quantum mechanical operator for a muon, which is a spin-½ particle. So I think P is the spin operator.

The operator components are given as matrices. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the standard Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So, the components of the operator P are given in terms of the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator in the arbitrary direction n. Oh right, so the operator for the spin along a direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero, right? Because the x-z plane is where y=0. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So the operator P simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction vector n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out. Since each component (P_x, P_z) is multiplied by n_x and n_z respectively.

So P = n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the two matrices:

P_x part gives [ [0, n_x], [n_x, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.
P_z part gives [ [n_z, 0], [0, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Adding them together, we get the matrix as above.

Now, we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the matrix P, when multiplied by the eigenvector, gives (ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

So, to find the eigenvector, we can set up the equation (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I):

P is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So, (P - (ħ/2) I) would be (ħ/2)([n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]) - (ħ/2) I.

Which is (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1] ]

Wait, no. Let me compute each element:

Top-left: (ħ/2) n_z - ħ/2 *1 = (ħ/2)(n_z -1)
Top-right: (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom-left: (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom-right: (ħ/2)(-n_z) - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(-n_z -1)

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x],
         [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

But perhaps it's easier to write the equation without the factor of ħ/2. Let me factor that out.

So the equation is:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x      ] [a]   = 0
[   n_x    (-n_z -1) ] [b]

Here, a and b are the components of the eigenvector |v> = [a; b].

So the system of equations is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These two equations must hold for non-trivial solutions (a,b not zero). So, for the system to have non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

But perhaps it's easier to solve one equation and express a in terms of b, or vice versa.

Looking at the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 --> (n_z -1) a = -n_x b --> a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Hmm, but I can think in terms of direction. Let me parameterize the direction vector n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, which implies that n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Let me represent n using spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because for the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is between 0 and π/2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the positive z-axis. But for the x-z plane, it's more convenient to define θ as the angle from the x-axis. Oh, perhaps it's better to define it as the angle from the x-axis, so that n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Because then, when θ=0, the direction is along x; θ=π/2, along z.

So, substituting n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ.

So, substituting into a:

a = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1) ] b

Wait, let me compute the denominator: (n_z -1) = sinθ -1.

Hmm, maybe simplifying this expression.

Let me factor out a negative sign: sinθ - 1 = -(1 - sinθ)

So,

a = [ - cosθ ] / ( - (1 - sinθ) ) * b

The negatives cancel, so:

a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] * b

Hmm, perhaps we can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ) to rationalize.

So,

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] * b

Denominator becomes 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So,

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / cos²θ * b

Simplify:

a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * b

So,

a = (1 + sinθ) / cosθ * b

Alternatively, a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b

So, the ratio a/b is (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

Hmm, let me write this as [ (1 + sinθ) ] / cosθ = [ (1/cosθ) + (sinθ/cosθ) ) ] = secθ + tanθ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express a as this ratio times b.

Wait, but perhaps we can find a better way to express this. Let me think about the eigenvector.

Another approach: Let's think about the eigenvector for the spin in direction n. For spin-½ particles, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.

The spin-up state for direction n can be written as a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis.

The general form is |+n> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>, but wait, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so no y-component. So, for n in x-z plane, φ=0. So the state simplifies to cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought n_x = cosθ, but perhaps in the spherical system, θ is the angle from the z-axis. Let me double-check.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ (the azimuthal angle) is 0 or π. So, for example, along the x-axis, φ=0, θ=π/2. Along the z-axis, φ=0, θ=0.

So, if n is in the x-z plane, and making an angle θ from the z-axis, then n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, wait, that's a different approach. Let me be precise.

In spherical coordinates, a unit vector n can be written as:

n = ( sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ )

So, when in the x-z plane, φ=0, so n = ( sinθ, 0, cosθ )

But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So, substituting φ=0, we have n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me see: when θ=0, the direction is along +z. So, n_x=0, n_z=1. Correct. When θ=90 degrees (π/2 radians), the direction is along +x. So, n_x=1, n_z=0. Correct.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, earlier I thought n_x was cosθ. But perhaps I got that wrong. So this is a point to clarify.

So, given that, the operator P is in the direction n, which is (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, putting that into the matrix P:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_z  n_x
           n_x  -n_z ]

So,

P = (ħ/2) [ cosθ    sinθ
           sinθ   -cosθ ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the matrix equation is:

( P - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0

Which is:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ     sinθ      ]   [a]
        [ sinθ   -cosθ ]   [b]
          - (ħ/2) I becomes subtracting (ħ/2) times identity matrix.

So,

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1)   sinθ        ] [a]   = 0
        [  sinθ     (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

Factor out (ħ/2):

[ (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b ] = 0
[ sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b ] = 0

So, let's write the equations:

1. (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ), so:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Wait, this can be simplified using trigonometric identities. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

Simplify: numerator and denominator both have 2 sin(theta/2), so they cancel.

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b

So a = cot(theta/2) b

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T

But wait, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, we can choose b = 1 for simplicity, but we need to normalize the vector.

Wait, but wait, the direction of the eigenvector will depend on the choice of b. Alternatively, to find the normalized eigenvector, we can let b be a normalization factor.

Let me compute the components a and b in terms of theta.

Let me express a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ]

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and we're dealing with spin-½, the eigenvectors are normalized.

Wait, but let's compute it. Let me choose b = 1 for simplicity, but then normalize.

Wait, no, let me write the components in terms of a normalization factor.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write the eigenvector as:

|v> = [ a; b ]

With a = cot(theta/2) b.

So, substituting:

|v> = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ]

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2)|² |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ]

But cot^2 x +1 = csc^2 x = 1 / sin² x.

So, norm squared is |b|² (1 / sin²(theta/2) )

We want the norm to be 1, so:

|b|² (1 / sin²(theta/2) ) ) = 1 → |b|² = sin²(theta/2) → |b|= sin(theta/2)

Since we're dealing with normalized eigenvectors, we can take b = sin(theta/2), and a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Wait, let's compute:

If b = sin(theta/2), then:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

So, the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, wait! Because in our earlier substitution, we have a = cot(theta/2) * b, which in this case is cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second: the original equations were for spin-up state along direction n. So, the spin-up state should be along n, which is in the x-z plane. So, the eigenvector should be a combination of the standard basis states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, in the standard z-basis, |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So, the eigenvector for spin-up along n is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector elements. Are the options in terms of the components?

But wait, the options I remember are:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
Option D: [√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, no, let me look back at the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but our result is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as the eigenvector. So that's option C.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So that would be option C.

Wait, but let me think about the direction. Because the direction vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so theta is the angle from the z-axis. So when theta is 0, we're along +z.

But the eigenvector in the spin-up state along +z is [1; 0], which is cos(0/2) = 1, sin(0/2)=0. So that's correct.

When theta is 90 degrees, n is along x, so the eigenvector is [cos(45), sin(45)] = [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct for spin-up along x.

So the answer must be option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but wait, the question says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?".

But the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is already normalized, since cos² + sin² =1.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it has components $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

Substituting the given matrices, $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( \vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]

Substituting $\vec{P}$ and $I$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]

Factoring out $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the system of equations is:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0
\]

To solve this, we parameterize $\vec{n}$ in spherical coordinates. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, and $\vec{n}$ can be written as:

\[
n_x = \sin\theta, \quad n_z = \cos\theta
\]

Substituting these into the equations, we find:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0
\]

From the first equation:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

To normalize, we compute the norm:

\[
\| |v\rangle \|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = \cot^2(\theta/2) |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 \left( \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 \right)
\]

Using $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, we find:

\[
|b| = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

Substituting this back, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This matches option **C**, which states $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A**: Incorrect normalization and dependence on $\hbar$.  
- **B**: Includes an $e^{i\phi}$ term, which is unnecessary since $\phi = 0$ for $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.  
- **D**: Incorrectly includes $\sqrt{2/3}\hbar$ and $\sqrt{1/3}\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
