Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

Wait, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors. So the state vector here is χ = [3i, 4]^T. I think the notation is that the first component is for spin-up and the second for spin-down in some basis. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the basis here, but I think for this problem, it's the standard computational basis for spin-1/2 particles.

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y, the spin component along the y-axis. The formula for the expectation value of an operator is ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh right, S_y is the spin operator along y, and it's given in the problem as σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Let me write down what σ_y is. The matrix is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, I need to compute ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Let's break this down. First, compute S_y acting on χ, then take the inner product with χ.

Wait, χ is the column vector [3i; 4]. So let me compute S_y |χ⟩.

Multiplying S_y by |χ⟩: 

S_y |χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i; i, 0] ] * [3i; 4]

Let me compute the matrix multiplication part first. So the matrix [0, -i; i, 0] multiplied by [3i; 4] gives:

First element: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i.
Second element: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*3i + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So the result of the matrix multiplication is [ -4i; -3 ]. Then multiply by ħ/2, so S_y |χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of χ multiplied by this vector. The conjugate transpose of χ is [ -3i, 4 ] because the original χ is [3i;4], so the conjugate is [-3i;4], and then transpose to row vector.

Wait, χ is [3i,4]^T. So χ† is [3i*, 4*], which is [-3i, 4] as a row vector. 

So now, χ† multiplied by S_y |χ⟩ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

Let me compute the dot product. 

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = (12 i²) = 12*(-1) = -12.
Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So summing these two: (-12) + (-12) = -24. 

But wait, I have to remember the (ħ/2) factor. So the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = (-24 * ħ) / 2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them immediately say -12hbar. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -12hbar/25
B) 12hbar/25
C) 25hbar/2
D) -25hbar/2

Hmm, none of them match -12hbar. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the matrix multiplication. Let me re-calculate S_y |χ⟩.

S_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So, when I multiply this by [3i;4], the first component is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. The second component is i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3. So, the matrix product is [ -4i; -3 ]. So that part seems correct.

Then, S_y |χ⟩ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ] = [ (-4i ħ)/2, (-3 ħ)/2 ]^T.

Now, the expectation value is χ† S_y χ. So χ† is [ 3i*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ].

So, the product is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ (-4i ħ)/2, (-3 ħ)/2 ]^T.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i ħ)/2 = (12 i² ħ ) / 2 = (12 * (-1) ) * ħ /2 = (-12 ħ)/2 = -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 * (-3 ħ)/2 = (-12 ħ)/2 = -6 ħ.

Adding them together: (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that's what I had before. But the options don't have -12 ħ. So perhaps the initial state vector is normalized? Because maybe the state isn't normalized, leading to a different result.

Wait, the given state is [3i,4]. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So perhaps the state should be normalized; that is, the actual state is (1/5) [3i,4], because the norm squared is 25.

Oh! I see where I went wrong. I didn't normalize the state vector. So the actual state vector is χ = (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

So I need to include this normalization in the expectation value.

So, let me correct that. The actual χ is (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

So S_y |χ⟩ is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

Wait, let me recompute that. So, compute the matrix multiplication first.

[ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i;4] = [ -4i ; -3 ] as before.

So S_y |χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (1/5)[ -4i; -3 ] = (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, the conjugate transpose of χ is [ (-3i)/5, 4/5 ].

So, χ† S_y χ is [ (-3i)/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by (ħ/(10)) [ -4i; -3 ]

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i ħ/10 ) = (12 i² ħ ) / (50) = (12 * (-1) ) ħ / 50 = -12 ħ /50.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3 ħ/10 ) = ( -12 ħ ) / 50.

Adding them together: (-12/50 ħ) + (-12/50 ħ) = (-24/50) ħ = (-12/25) ħ.

So that's the expectation value: (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking back at the options, option A is -12hbar/25. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait a second, but wait. Did I correctly account for the normalization? Because the original state is [3i,4], which has a norm squared of 25, so the actual state is [3i/5,4/5], I think.

Yes, so I think the mistake was not considering the normalization. So the correct expectation value is -12ħ/25, which is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state**:  
   The norm of the state is computed as:  
   \[
   \|\chi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \chi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Therefore:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Action of \( S_y \) on \( \chi \)**:  
   Compute \( S_y \chi \):  
   \[
   S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   First, compute the matrix multiplication:  
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \frac{1}{5} \):  
   \[
   S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Expectation value \( \langle S_y \rangle \)**:  
   The expectation value is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \chi^\dagger S_y \chi,
   \]  
   where \( \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i/5 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix} \).  
   Compute the dot product:  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger S_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i/5 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix} \frac{\hbar}{10} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   First term:  
   \[
   \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \left(-\frac{4i \hbar}{10}\right) = \frac{12 i^2 \hbar}{50} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{50}.
   \]  
   Second term:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \left(-\frac{3 \hbar}{10}\right) = \frac{-12 \hbar}{50}.
   \]  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-12 \hbar}{50} + \frac{-12 \hbar}{50} = \frac{-24 \hbar}{50} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
