Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group. Hmm, esters have carbonyl groups, so the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ or so. That's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break that down. Two signals are from aromatic protons. A six-membered aromatic ring with two substituents—so maybe it's like para or ortho substitution? But wait, two signals for aromatic-H, that suggests symmetry. Like, perhaps two equivalent protons in one position and another two in another position because of the substituents.

Then, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH or something similar. Wait, but in a di-substituted aromatic ring, maybe it's part of a substituent like an ester. Ester groups have a carbonyl and an ester oxygen, but also maybe a vinyl group if it's something like a substituted ester.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted. Let me think about possible structures. Let's say the substituents are ester groups. But wait, an ester would be like O-CO-O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else. But wait, the IR only mentions an ester, so maybe both substituents are esters? Or maybe one is an ester and the other is another group that doesn't have an O in it, but that's not clear.

Wait, the options for the formula are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. So all of them have 2 oxygen atoms. Since the IR shows an ester, which is O, so that fits.

Now, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear downfield. The splitting might tell us about their neighboring groups. One is a doublet and another is a doublet of quartets. Let me think: a vinyl group could be part of an ester, maybe an alkenyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are ester groups attached to the benzene ring. Let's say one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R. But wait, esters are usually O-CO-O-R, so the R group could be an alkyl or another aromatic group.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. And no signals for –CH2 groups. So all the CH₂ groups must be equivalent or not present. Hmm.

Let me think about the structure. Maybe the substituents are ester groups connected to a vinyl group. So maybe something like a benzene ring with two ester substituents, each of which is attached to a vinyl group, which might have methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are groups like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that would have CH2 groups, which would show up in the NMR. But the question says there are no CH2 signals. So any CH2 groups would have to be either not present or perhaps in a symmetric position so their signals don't split into multiple peaks.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic protons: two signals. Suppose the ring has two substituents that create symmetry. For example, if the substituents are meta to each other, the ring might have two sets of aromatic protons. Alternatively, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two equivalent sets, but each set would have two protons each. Wait, but in a para di-substituted benzene, the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent to each substituent, so maybe each substituent is at para position, making the ring have two sets of two protons each. So the two signals would each integrate to 2H each.

Then, the vinyl-H. One doublet and one doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests each proton is adjacent to one proton. Maybe a CH₂ group attached to something else. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, which might indicate a coupling with one neighboring proton. The other is a doublet of quartets—so each proton is coupling with two sets of protons, maybe two neighboring groups. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent.

Let me think of a structure. Suppose the benzene ring has two ester groups attached. Each ester is O-CO-O-R. But if R is a vinyl group, maybe like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂... No, that would have CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. Alternatively, maybe R is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are groups like CH₂CH₂COO-. No, that might have more CH2. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are acetate groups (OAc), but the NMR shows vinyl groups, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are phenyl esters or something else. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, something like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂CH₂... No, but that brings CH2 into play again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester. So the ester would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂... No, again involving CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. Like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂... No, same problem.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps one substituent has a vinyl group, and another substituent has a different group? Or each substituent has a vinyl group, but in different positions.

Alternatively, let me think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl. So total 2 + 2 + 2 =6 signals. That makes sense if the molecule has some symmetry, reducing the number of unique proton environments.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are ester groups, and each ester is connected to a vinyl group. For example, the benzene has two substituents, each being an ester group, and each ester is connected to a vinyl group.

Wait, for example, something like two groups attached to the benzene: each being O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂... No, that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a methyl ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are groups like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂CH3, but that's a propyl ester. No, that would have CH2 groups, but we don't see any in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are vinyl esters. Like O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂-O... No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are acrylate groups. Acrylic esters have a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂COO... No, wait, acrylate is something like O-CO-O-(CH₂)₂CH₂? No, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH2... No, again, brings in CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester linked to a benzyl group. But that would have a benzene ring attached, which might complicate the aromatic protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-O-CH₂CH3, but that's an ethyl ester and would have CH2 in the ester. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are C11H12O2, etc. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C11H12O2: (2*11 + 2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24 -12)/2 = 6. So 6 degrees. A benzene ring has 3 (from the ring) plus each double bond. Wait, benzene is 3 for the ring, each substituent with double bonds adds more.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted benzene, so the benzene contributes 3 degrees. Let's say the substituents are ester groups. Each ester has a carbonyl (1 degree) and an ether-like linkage (but that's part of the ester). So each substituent would add 1 degree (the carbonyl). Two substituents add 2 degrees. So total degrees: 3 +2 =5. But the formula has 6. So where's the sixth?

Ah, perhaps there's a double bond in the substituents. If each substituent is an ester with an alkene, that adds another degree. So for example, if substituent is O-CO-O-(CH2) something with a double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's take the formula for each option and calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Option A: C11H14O2

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. A benzene ring (3) plus two substituents, each maybe a carbonyl (ester), adding 1 each. So 3+2=5. That fits.

Option B: C12H14O2

(2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. So 6 degrees. Benzene (3) plus two substituents each with a carbonyl (2) plus another double bond somewhere. Like an alkene in a substituent.

Option C: C12H12O2

(2*12 +2 -12)/2=(26-12)/2=7. Benzene (3) plus two substituents each with carbonyl (2) plus another ring or double bond. Maybe a ring in substituent.

Option D: C11H12O2

(2*11 +2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees.

Wait, the question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the benzene ring is 3 degrees. Then substituents may add more.

If the NMR indicates vinyl groups, that suggests double bonds. So perhaps each substituent is an ester with a vinyl group.

For example, each substituent is an ester with a double bond, like O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2... Wait, but that's single bonds. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH2CH₂ would have a single bond, but if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂, no double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂. No, that's single bonds. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂ something with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂... No, not exactly. Wait, propenoate would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂COO...? No, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between the second and third carbon. So like O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic signals: two signals. So maybe the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two types of protons. Like, for example, if the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon. So each substituent is at para positions, making the aromatic protons symmetric. So two sets of two protons each. So their integration would each be 2H, and each a doublet or something.

Then, the vinyl-H signals: two signals, one a doublet and another a doublet of quartets. So perhaps there are two different vinyl groups. Let's say one substituent has a vinyl group that is in a trans configuration, and another substituent has another vinyl group in a different configuration.

But wait, each substituent is an ester group, and perhaps the ester is attached to a vinyl group. So for each substituent, the structure might be O-CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-... No, that brings in CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR has no -CH₂ signals. So any CH₂ groups must be in a symmetric position or not present. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituents are ester groups with a methyl group attached. Like O-CO-O-CH₂CH3. But that would have a CH2 group in the ester, which would show up as a triplet or something. But the problem states there are no CH₂ signals, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH3, which is a methyl ester. Then, the ester substituent would be O-CO-OCH3. That would contribute a singlet for the methyl group, but in the NMR, the -CH3 groups are two signals. So maybe each substituent has a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, but each substituent is an ester group. So each has a O-CO-O-R group. So if R is a methyl group, then each substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Then, the methyl would appear as a singlet, but the NMR shows two methyl signals. So perhaps each substituent has a different R group.

Wait, but the substituent can't be both O-CO-O-R1 and O-CO-O-R2 if the substituents are different. Then, each R would contribute a different -CH3.

So, for example, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (but that has CH2 groups, which are not present), or substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but same problem).

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH3 and substituent B is O-CO-OCH3. But then, this would lead to two different methyl groups, so their NMR signals would split into two separate signals. But then, the ester would have both ethyl and methyl groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows two -CH3 groups. So perhaps each substituent is an ester with a methyl group. So two substituents, each with O-CO-OCH3. Then, the two methyl groups would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But the NMR shows two methyl signals. So maybe the substituents are different.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but that would have CH2 groups, which aren't in the NMR. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the substituents are O-CO-O-(some group without CH2). Like an allyl group, but that brings in CH2 again.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-Ph, but that would make the substituents benzoyloxy groups, which don't have CH2 or CH3. But then, the NMR wouldn't show any methyl or vinyl signals. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something about the structure. Let's think about the NMR again.

We have two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, and another a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in a CH2=CH- group, but perhaps in this case, each substituent brings a vinyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2CH₂, but that's not right. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂ might have a double bond. Wait, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂ is actually O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂, but that's a single bond. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about a possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents, each being an ester group connected to a vinyl group. For example, each substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂. No, that brings in CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond. So O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between CH₂ and CH₂. So O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ would have a double bond. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH=CH₂. Wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, but then each substituent has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). So in the NMR, the vinyl protons would show up. But how?

The structure would be benzene with two groups: O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂? No, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ would have a vinyl group if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2. Then, the vinyl group would have protons that are split into certain patterns.

In that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH₂CH=CH₂ group. So the doublet and the quartet would come from coupling between the vinyl protons. For example, the CH₂ group adjacent to the double bond would have protons that couple with the double bond protons.

Wait, maybe each substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but then the NMR would have CH2 signals, which it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are actually attached in a way that the vinyl groups are part of a ring, like in a cyclic ester. But that might complicate things.

Let me think about the NMR again. Two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Maybe the doublet is from a CH₂ group adjacent to a double bond, and the quartet is from a CH group next to another CH₂.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂. No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an acrylate ester. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So substituent would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂COO-. Wait, that would have more carbons and possible CH2 groups.

Wait, here's an alternative approach. Let's think about the two methyl groups. Two signals for -CH3, so two different methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents have different R groups in the ester.

For example, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), and substituent B is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). Then, each would have a methyl group (from OCH3) in one substituent and a CH2CH3 in the other. Wait, but then in the NMR, the OCH3 would appear as a singlet (maybe around δ 3.8), and the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would have a triplet and a quartet. But the problem states that there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if the substituents are both methyl esters, then the methyl groups would be equivalent and give a single peak. But the NMR shows two peaks for methyl, so they must be in different environments.

Another idea: perhaps the substituents have a methyl group attached elsewhere, like in a vinyl group. For example, each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3, but that brings in CH2 groups again.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. Then each substituent has a methyl group attached to a carbon, which would give a singlet for each methyl, but since the substituents are in the same position, they could be equivalent. But the NMR shows two methyl signals, so perhaps the substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is O-CO-O-CH3 (methyl ester) and another is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), but then the propyl would have CH2 groups, which would show up in NMR. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options and see which formula fits the structure.

The IR shows an ester, so two oxygen atoms are present. The NMR has six signals, which suggests a molecule with some symmetry but enough unique protons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → Degree of Unsat: 5. Benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) → total 5. That fits.

Option B: C12H14O2 → Degree:6. Benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) + one more double bond (maybe in a substituent).

Option C: C12H12O2 → Degree:7 → could have benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) + another ring or double bond.

Option D: C11H12O2 → Degree:6. Benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) + one more double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl protons, which implies double bonds in the substituents. So, substituent(s) must have double bonds.

So, for the formula to have an additional degree beyond the benzene and two esters, it must have a double bond.

So which options have that?

Option B: 6 degrees. 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 1 (another double bond) =6. So that would fit.

Option D: 6 degrees. 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) +1=6.

Wait, so both B and D have enough degrees. So how to choose between them.

The NMR has two vinyl-H signals, which implies two different sets of vinyl protons. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, each contributing their own H signals.

If each substituent has a vinyl group, then the substituents must have a double bond, adding to the degrees of unsaturation.

So, if each substituent contributes one double bond, that would add two degrees. But that would require the total degrees to be 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 2 (vinyl) =7. Which would match option C (7 degrees). But option C's formula is C12H12O2.

Wait, but option C is C12H12O2. Let's calculate its degrees: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7. So 7 degrees. So that would account for 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 2 (vinyl) =7.

But earlier, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, adding two double bonds. So the formula would need to have at least two more double bonds beyond the benzene and ester.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the substituents. If each substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, that would add two double bonds (from the two vinyl groups), so the degrees would be 3+2+2=7. So the formula must have 7 degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options, only option C (C12H12O2) has 7 degrees. So that would fit.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups. If each substituent has a vinyl group, perhaps the substituents are like O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2... No, that would have CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that has a CH2, which would show up in the NMR, but the question says no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Another possibility: the substituents are O-CO-O-(CH2)0, meaning they're directly attached without CH2. But that's impossible because the ester needs to have a carbon chain.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH₂CH₂ but without any CH2 signals. That doesn't make sense because the ester would have CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, each substituent has two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. But that would give a singlet for the methyl groups if they're equivalent. But the NMR shows two methyl signals, so maybe substituents are different.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → molecular formula.

B) C12H14O2.

C) C12H12O2.

D) C11H12O2.

The problem is a di-substituted benzene, so the parent is C6H4. Then, each substituent adds a group. Let's say each substituent is an ester group, which would be O-CO-O-R. So each substituent adds (O-CO-O-R) → R's formula depends on the substituent.

Wait, let's calculate the substituent. Let's say each substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So each substituent's formula is CnH2n+1O2.

Wait, no. Ester group is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. So the ester group itself is O-CO-O-R. So the formula for the ester group is (O) from the ester linkage, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, each substituent contributes a certain number of carbons. Let's say the benzene is C6H4.

Each substituent is O-CO-O-R. So each substituent adds (O-CO-O-R) → the R group is connected to the oxygen.

Wait, the molecular formula of the compound would be C6H4(O-CO-O-R)₂.

The formula of each R group would vary. Let's say that R is a methyl group, then the substituent is O-CO-O-CH3. Each substituent adds (O-CO-O-CH3) → which is 1 carbon. So two substituents would add 2 carbons, making the molecule C8H8O4. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, R could be ethyl. Then each substituent adds 2 carbons. Two substituents add 4, so the molecule would be C10H12O4. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps R is a propenyl group, which is CH₂=CH-CH₂-. So R is CH₂=CHCH2- something. Wait, but each substituent would have O-CO-O-CH₂=CHCH₂-... No, that brings in more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps R is CH₂=CH2. But wait, that's ethylene, which may not be possible. Alternatively, R is a vinyl group, CH₂=CH-.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula again. The options are C11H12O2, etc. So the parent is C6H4. Each substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R. Each substituent would contribute (O-CO-O-R) → which is (O2) and (COOR). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, so each substituent adds (1 C from COO) plus the R group.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an O-CO-O-CH2CH3 group. Then, each substituent adds 2 carbons (from CH2CH3). So two substituents add 4 carbons, making the molecule C10H14O4. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe each substituent is a methyl group. So O-CO-O-CH3. Each substituent adds 1 carbon. Two substituents add 2, so the molecule is C8H8O4. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a benzyl group. But then the substituent would be O-CO-O-Ph, adding 6 carbons (from benzene) each. But that would make the formula C12H10O4, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, I'm probably complicating this. Let's think about the number of protons in the NMR.

The NMR has 2 aromatic protons × 2 signals = 4 aromatic protons (since each is integrating to 2 H). So the benzene has two substituents that each have two equivalent aromatic protons adjacent. That suggests the substituents are in the para position. So the structure is para di-substituted.

So the aromatic ring has four protons, two in each position (each substituent being para, so each substituent has two equivalent H adjacent).

Then, the other signals: two vinyl-H. One doublet (each H has one neighbor), perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. The other is a doublet of quartets, which suggests each H is coupled with two sets of protons—maybe a CH group adjacent to a CH2.

And two -CH3 groups. So each substituent may have a methyl group attached in a way that gives two different methyl environments.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that brings in CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but again, CH2 is present.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure that fits all the given NMR data.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic signals: 2H each, so perhaps 2 sets of 2H. So substituents are in para positions.

- Two vinyl-H signals: each with different coupling. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, but in a way that their protons are different.

- Two CH3 groups: two different methyl groups.

No CH2 groups.

So perhaps each substituent is an ester where R is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, but without any CH2.

Wait, like O-CO-O-CH(CH2CH2...) No, perhaps it's O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. Then each substituent has two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. But then, the methyl groups would be equivalent, giving one peak, but the NMR shows two, so that can't be.

Alternatively, each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. But that brings CH2 into play, which isn't present.

Wait, here's another idea. The substituents might not be directly connected to the ester. Maybe each substituent is a vinyl group connected to the benzene, and the ester is part of a side chain.

Wait, but the IR shows ester, so the ester must be part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group attached to an ester. But that brings in CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like the benzene ring has two ester substituents, each being O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. But that brings in CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm. Maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2, but without any CH2 in the NMR.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think about the number of signals. There are six signals, each integrating to 2H, 2H, etc.

Wait, the aromatic has 2 signals, each 2H. The vinyl has 2 signals, each perhaps 1H and 2H? Wait, no, the NMR has six signals in total: two aromatic (each integrating to 2H), two vinyl (each maybe 1H each?), and two CH3 (each maybe 3H). Wait, but that adds up to 2×2=4H (aromatic), 2×(say, 1H each)=2H (vinyl), and 2×3=6H (CH3), totaling 12 H. 

Wait, the molecular formula must have a total of H as in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option B: C12H14O2 →14 H.

Option C: C12H12O2 →12 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 →12 H.

In the NMR, if the total H is 2×2 (aromatic) + 2×1 (vinyl) + 2×3 (methyl) = 4 +2 +6=12 H, then the molecular formula would have 12 H. So options C and D have 12 H.

Wait, but the aromatic might have more H. Wait, the benzene ring in di-substituted would have 4 aromatic H, but if substituents are para, the four H are in two sets of two. So 4 H in aromatic. Then, the vinyl H could be 2 H (each substituent has one H?), but NMR shows two signals, so perhaps each vinyl group has one H? Or two H in each substituent?

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Let's say each substituent has a vinyl group with one H each. So total 2 H from vinyl. Then, the two methyl groups contribute 6 H. So 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) +6 (methyl) =12 H.

So the formula must have 12 H. So options C (C12H12O2) and D (C11H12O2) have 12 H.

So between C and D.

The degrees of unsaturation for C: 7. For D:6.

The substituents have two ester groups and possibly a double bond.

If each substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, that adds two more double bonds, so total degrees of 3 (benzene) + 2 (ester) +2 (vinyl) =7. So that would require the formula to have 7 degrees, which is option C.

So the formula would be C12H12O2.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula.

Benzene (C6H4) + 2 substituents, each being an ester with a vinyl group.

Each substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is CH2CH2CH2 (but that brings CH2), which is not allowed. Alternatively, R is CH2=CH2, but that brings CH2.

Wait, maybe R is a methyl group. So each substituent is O-CO-O-CH3. Then, each substituent adds 1 C and 3 H.

So benzene (C6H4) + 2*(O-CO-O-CH3) → C6 + 2*(1) = C8. H: 4 (benzene) + 2*(3) =10 H. But O is 2 per substituent, so O=4. But the formula would be C8H10O4, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. Then, each substituent adds 2 C, 5 H. So benzene (C6H4) + 2*(2 C) = C10. H: 4 + 2*(5) =14 H. O: 2 substituents * (2 O from ester) =4 O? But the formula in the options for option B is C12H14O2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH3. Each substituent adds 2 C and 5 H. So benzene (C6H4) plus 2 substituents: C6+4= C10. H: 4 + 2*5=14. O: 2*(2 O from ester) + 2 from the benzene? No, wait, each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH3, which brings 2 O per substituent. So O is 4. So formula is C10H14O4. Not matching any options.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct formula based on the NMR and IR data.

The presence of an ester group in IR suggests O in the formula. The NMR shows 2 methyl groups (so at least two different CH3 groups), two vinyl groups (so two double bonds), and a para-substituted benzene.

The molecular formula likely has 12 H, so options C and D.

Option C: C12H12O2 → Degrees:7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → Degrees:6.

If the structure has two vinyl groups (each with a double bond), that adds two degrees beyond benzene and esters. So total degrees would be 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 2 (vinyl) =7. So option C.

So the formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C. But wait, the options are listed as:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

So the correct answer is C.

The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the $^1$H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups, with no signals for CH$_2$ groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen atom in the structure.

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, where the two substituents create symmetry, resulting in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest the presence of two distinct vinyl groups with different environments.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two different methyl groups in the structure.
   - **Absence of CH$_2$ Signals**: This implies that any CH$_2$ groups in the molecule are either absent or in symmetric environments that do not produce distinct signals.

3. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The molecular formula must account for the benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation), two ester groups (2 degrees), and additional unsaturation from the vinyl groups (2 degrees), totaling 7 degrees of unsaturation.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A (C$_{11}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5. This does not account for the two vinyl groups, so it is incorrect.
   - **Option B (C$_{12}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. This accounts for the benzene ring and two ester groups but not the two vinyl groups, so it is incorrect.
   - **Option C (C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7. This matches the benzene ring (3), two ester groups (2), and two vinyl groups (2), making it the correct choice.
   - **Option D (C$_{11}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. Similar to Option B, this does not account for the two vinyl groups, so it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that satisfies all the given data, including the FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and degrees of unsaturation, is **C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$**.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group. Hmm, esters have carbonyl groups, so the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ or so. That's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break that down. Two signals are from aromatic protons. A six-membered aromatic ring with two substituents—so maybe it's like para or ortho substitution? But wait, two signals for aromatic-H, that suggests symmetry. Like, perhaps two equivalent protons in one position and another two in another position because of the substituents.

Then, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH or something similar. Wait, but in a di-substituted aromatic ring, maybe it's part of a substituent like an ester. Ester groups have a carbonyl and an ester oxygen, but also maybe a vinyl group if it's something like a substituted ester.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted. Let me think about possible structures. Let's say the substituents are ester groups. But wait, an ester would be like O-CO-O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else. But wait, the IR only mentions an ester, so maybe both substituents are esters? Or maybe one is an ester and the other is another group that doesn't have an O in it, but that's not clear.

Wait, the options for the formula are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. So all of them have 2 oxygen atoms. Since the IR shows an ester, which is O, so that fits.

Now, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear downfield. The splitting might tell us about their neighboring groups. One is a doublet and another is a doublet of quartets. Let me think: a vinyl group could be part of an ester, maybe an alkenyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are ester groups attached to the benzene ring. Let's say one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R. But wait, esters are usually O-CO-O-R, so the R group could be an alkyl or another aromatic group.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. And no signals for –CH2 groups. So all the CH₂ groups must be equivalent or not present. Hmm.

Let me think about the structure. Maybe the substituents are ester groups connected to a vinyl group. So maybe something like a benzene ring with two ester substituents, each of which is attached to a vinyl group, which might have methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are groups like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that would have CH2 groups, which would show up in the NMR. But the question says there are no CH2 signals. So any CH2 groups would have to be either not present or perhaps in a symmetric position so their signals don't split into multiple peaks.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic protons: two signals. Suppose the ring has two substituents that create symmetry. For example, if the substituents are meta to each other, the ring might have two sets of aromatic protons. Alternatively, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two equivalent sets, but each set would have two protons each. Wait, but in a para di-substituted benzene, the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent to each substituent, so maybe each substituent is at para position, making the ring have two sets of two protons each. So the two signals would each integrate to 2H each.

Then, the vinyl-H. One doublet and one doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests each proton is adjacent to one proton. Maybe a CH₂ group attached to something else. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, which might indicate a coupling with one neighboring proton. The other is a doublet of quartets—so each proton is coupling with two sets of protons, maybe two neighboring groups. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent.

Let me think of a structure. Suppose the benzene ring has two ester groups attached. Each ester is O-CO-O-R. But if R is a vinyl group, maybe like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂... No, that would have CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. Alternatively, maybe R is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are groups like CH₂CH₂COO-. No, that might have more CH2. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are acetate groups (OAc), but the NMR shows vinyl groups, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are phenyl esters or something else. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, something like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂CH₂... No, but that brings CH2 into play again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester. So the ester would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂... No, again involving CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. Like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂... No, same problem.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps one substituent has a vinyl group, and another substituent has a different group? Or each substituent has a vinyl group, but in different positions.

Alternatively, let me think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl. So total 2 + 2 + 2 =6 signals. That makes sense if the molecule has some symmetry, reducing the number of unique proton environments.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are ester groups, and each ester is connected to a vinyl group. For example, the benzene has two substituents, each being an ester group, and each ester is connected to a vinyl group.

Wait, for example, something like two groups attached to the benzene: each being O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂... No, that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a methyl ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are groups like O-CO-OCH₂CH₂CH3, but that's a propyl ester. No, that would have CH2 groups, but we don't see any in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are vinyl esters. Like O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂-O... No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are acrylate groups. Acrylic esters have a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂COO... No, wait, acrylate is something like O-CO-O-(CH₂)₂CH₂? No, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH2... No, again, brings in CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester linked to a benzyl group. But that would have a benzene ring attached, which might complicate the aromatic protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-O-CH₂CH3, but that's an ethyl ester and would have CH2 in the ester. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are C11H12O2, etc. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C11H12O2: (2*11 + 2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24 -12)/2 = 6. So 6 degrees. A benzene ring has 3 (from the ring) plus each double bond. Wait, benzene is 3 for the ring, each substituent with double bonds adds more.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted benzene, so the benzene contributes 3 degrees. Let's say the substituents are ester groups. Each ester has a carbonyl (1 degree) and an ether-like linkage (but that's part of the ester). So each substituent would add 1 degree (the carbonyl). Two substituents add 2 degrees. So total degrees: 3 +2 =5. But the formula has 6. So where's the sixth?

Ah, perhaps there's a double bond in the substituents. If each substituent is an ester with an alkene, that adds another degree. So for example, if substituent is O-CO-O-(CH2) something with a double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's take the formula for each option and calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Option A: C11H14O2

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. A benzene ring (3) plus two substituents, each maybe a carbonyl (ester), adding 1 each. So 3+2=5. That fits.

Option B: C12H14O2

(2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. So 6 degrees. Benzene (3) plus two substituents each with a carbonyl (2) plus another double bond somewhere. Like an alkene in a substituent.

Option C: C12H12O2

(2*12 +2 -12)/2=(26-12)/2=7. Benzene (3) plus two substituents each with carbonyl (2) plus another ring or double bond. Maybe a ring in substituent.

Option D: C11H12O2

(2*11 +2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees.

Wait, the question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the benzene ring is 3 degrees. Then substituents may add more.

If the NMR indicates vinyl groups, that suggests double bonds. So perhaps each substituent is an ester with a vinyl group.

For example, each substituent is an ester with a double bond, like O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2... Wait, but that's single bonds. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH2CH₂ would have a single bond, but if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂, no double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂. No, that's single bonds. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂ something with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂... No, not exactly. Wait, propenoate would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂COO...? No, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between the second and third carbon. So like O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic signals: two signals. So maybe the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two types of protons. Like, for example, if the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon. So each substituent is at para positions, making the aromatic protons symmetric. So two sets of two protons each. So their integration would each be 2H, and each a doublet or something.

Then, the vinyl-H signals: two signals, one a doublet and another a doublet of quartets. So perhaps there are two different vinyl groups. Let's say one substituent has a vinyl group that is in a trans configuration, and another substituent has another vinyl group in a different configuration.

But wait, each substituent is an ester group, and perhaps the ester is attached to a vinyl group. So for each substituent, the structure might be O-CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-... No, that brings in CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR has no -CH₂ signals. So any CH₂ groups must be in a symmetric position or not present. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituents are ester groups with a methyl group attached. Like O-CO-O-CH₂CH3. But that would have a CH2 group in the ester, which would show up as a triplet or something. But the problem states there are no CH₂ signals, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH3, which is a methyl ester. Then, the ester substituent would be O-CO-OCH3. That would contribute a singlet for the methyl group, but in the NMR, the -CH3 groups are two signals. So maybe each substituent has a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, but each substituent is an ester group. So each has a O-CO-O-R group. So if R is a methyl group, then each substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Then, the methyl would appear as a singlet, but the NMR shows two methyl signals. So perhaps each substituent has a different R group.

Wait, but the substituent can't be both O-CO-O-R1 and O-CO-O-R2 if the substituents are different. Then, each R would contribute a different -CH3.

So, for example, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (but that has CH2 groups, which are not present), or substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but same problem).

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH3 and substituent B is O-CO-OCH3. But then, this would lead to two different methyl groups, so their NMR signals would split into two separate signals. But then, the ester would have both ethyl and methyl groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows two -CH3 groups. So perhaps each substituent is an ester with a methyl group. So two substituents, each with O-CO-OCH3. Then, the two methyl groups would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But the NMR shows two methyl signals. So maybe the substituents are different.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but that would have CH2 groups, which aren't in the NMR. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the substituents are O-CO-O-(some group without CH2). Like an allyl group, but that brings in CH2 again.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-Ph, but that would make the substituents benzoyloxy groups, which don't have CH2 or CH3. But then, the NMR wouldn't show any methyl or vinyl signals. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something about the structure. Let's think about the NMR again.

We have two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, and another a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in a CH2=CH- group, but perhaps in this case, each substituent brings a vinyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2CH₂, but that's not right. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂ might have a double bond. Wait, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂ is actually O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂, but that's a single bond. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about a possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents, each being an ester group connected to a vinyl group. For example, each substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂. No, that brings in CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond. So O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between CH₂ and CH₂. So O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ would have a double bond. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH=CH₂. Wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, but then each substituent has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). So in the NMR, the vinyl protons would show up. But how?

The structure would be benzene with two groups: O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂? No, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, perhaps O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂ would have a vinyl group if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2. Then, the vinyl group would have protons that are split into certain patterns.

In that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH₂CH=CH₂ group. So the doublet and the quartet would come from coupling between the vinyl protons. For example, the CH₂ group adjacent to the double bond would have protons that couple with the double bond protons.

Wait, maybe each substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but then the NMR would have CH2 signals, which it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are actually attached in a way that the vinyl groups are part of a ring, like in a cyclic ester. But that might complicate things.

Let me think about the NMR again. Two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Maybe the doublet is from a CH₂ group adjacent to a double bond, and the quartet is from a CH group next to another CH₂.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂. No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an acrylate ester. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So substituent would be O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂COO-. Wait, that would have more carbons and possible CH2 groups.

Wait, here's an alternative approach. Let's think about the two methyl groups. Two signals for -CH3, so two different methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents have different R groups in the ester.

For example, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), and substituent B is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). Then, each would have a methyl group (from OCH3) in one substituent and a CH2CH3 in the other. Wait, but then in the NMR, the OCH3 would appear as a singlet (maybe around δ 3.8), and the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would have a triplet and a quartet. But the problem states that there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if the substituents are both methyl esters, then the methyl groups would be equivalent and give a single peak. But the NMR shows two peaks for methyl, so they must be in different environments.

Another idea: perhaps the substituents have a methyl group attached elsewhere, like in a vinyl group. For example, each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3, but that brings in CH2 groups again.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. Then each substituent has a methyl group attached to a carbon, which would give a singlet for each methyl, but since the substituents are in the same position, they could be equivalent. But the NMR shows two methyl signals, so perhaps the substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is O-CO-O-CH3 (methyl ester) and another is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), but then the propyl would have CH2 groups, which would show up in NMR. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options and see which formula fits the structure.

The IR shows an ester, so two oxygen atoms are present. The NMR has six signals, which suggests a molecule with some symmetry but enough unique protons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → Degree of Unsat: 5. Benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) → total 5. That fits.

Option B: C12H14O2 → Degree:6. Benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) + one more double bond (maybe in a substituent).

Option C: C12H12O2 → Degree:7 → could have benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) + another ring or double bond.

Option D: C11H12O2 → Degree:6. Benzene (3) + two ester carbonyls (2) + one more double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl protons, which implies double bonds in the substituents. So, substituent(s) must have double bonds.

So, for the formula to have an additional degree beyond the benzene and two esters, it must have a double bond.

So which options have that?

Option B: 6 degrees. 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 1 (another double bond) =6. So that would fit.

Option D: 6 degrees. 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) +1=6.

Wait, so both B and D have enough degrees. So how to choose between them.

The NMR has two vinyl-H signals, which implies two different sets of vinyl protons. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, each contributing their own H signals.

If each substituent has a vinyl group, then the substituents must have a double bond, adding to the degrees of unsaturation.

So, if each substituent contributes one double bond, that would add two degrees. But that would require the total degrees to be 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 2 (vinyl) =7. Which would match option C (7 degrees). But option C's formula is C12H12O2.

Wait, but option C is C12H12O2. Let's calculate its degrees: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7. So 7 degrees. So that would account for 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 2 (vinyl) =7.

But earlier, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, adding two double bonds. So the formula would need to have at least two more double bonds beyond the benzene and ester.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the substituents. If each substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, that would add two double bonds (from the two vinyl groups), so the degrees would be 3+2+2=7. So the formula must have 7 degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options, only option C (C12H12O2) has 7 degrees. So that would fit.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups. If each substituent has a vinyl group, perhaps the substituents are like O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2... No, that would have CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that has a CH2, which would show up in the NMR, but the question says no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Another possibility: the substituents are O-CO-O-(CH2)0, meaning they're directly attached without CH2. But that's impossible because the ester needs to have a carbon chain.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH₂CH₂ but without any CH2 signals. That doesn't make sense because the ester would have CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, each substituent has two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. But that would give a singlet for the methyl groups if they're equivalent. But the NMR shows two methyl signals, so maybe substituents are different.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → molecular formula.

B) C12H14O2.

C) C12H12O2.

D) C11H12O2.

The problem is a di-substituted benzene, so the parent is C6H4. Then, each substituent adds a group. Let's say each substituent is an ester group, which would be O-CO-O-R. So each substituent adds (O-CO-O-R) → R's formula depends on the substituent.

Wait, let's calculate the substituent. Let's say each substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So each substituent's formula is CnH2n+1O2.

Wait, no. Ester group is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. So the ester group itself is O-CO-O-R. So the formula for the ester group is (O) from the ester linkage, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, each substituent contributes a certain number of carbons. Let's say the benzene is C6H4.

Each substituent is O-CO-O-R. So each substituent adds (O-CO-O-R) → the R group is connected to the oxygen.

Wait, the molecular formula of the compound would be C6H4(O-CO-O-R)₂.

The formula of each R group would vary. Let's say that R is a methyl group, then the substituent is O-CO-O-CH3. Each substituent adds (O-CO-O-CH3) → which is 1 carbon. So two substituents would add 2 carbons, making the molecule C8H8O4. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, R could be ethyl. Then each substituent adds 2 carbons. Two substituents add 4, so the molecule would be C10H12O4. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps R is a propenyl group, which is CH₂=CH-CH₂-. So R is CH₂=CHCH2- something. Wait, but each substituent would have O-CO-O-CH₂=CHCH₂-... No, that brings in more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps R is CH₂=CH2. But wait, that's ethylene, which may not be possible. Alternatively, R is a vinyl group, CH₂=CH-.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula again. The options are C11H12O2, etc. So the parent is C6H4. Each substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R. Each substituent would contribute (O-CO-O-R) → which is (O2) and (COOR). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, so each substituent adds (1 C from COO) plus the R group.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an O-CO-O-CH2CH3 group. Then, each substituent adds 2 carbons (from CH2CH3). So two substituents add 4 carbons, making the molecule C10H14O4. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe each substituent is a methyl group. So O-CO-O-CH3. Each substituent adds 1 carbon. Two substituents add 2, so the molecule is C8H8O4. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a benzyl group. But then the substituent would be O-CO-O-Ph, adding 6 carbons (from benzene) each. But that would make the formula C12H10O4, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, I'm probably complicating this. Let's think about the number of protons in the NMR.

The NMR has 2 aromatic protons × 2 signals = 4 aromatic protons (since each is integrating to 2 H). So the benzene has two substituents that each have two equivalent aromatic protons adjacent. That suggests the substituents are in the para position. So the structure is para di-substituted.

So the aromatic ring has four protons, two in each position (each substituent being para, so each substituent has two equivalent H adjacent).

Then, the other signals: two vinyl-H. One doublet (each H has one neighbor), perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. The other is a doublet of quartets, which suggests each H is coupled with two sets of protons—maybe a CH group adjacent to a CH2.

And two -CH3 groups. So each substituent may have a methyl group attached in a way that gives two different methyl environments.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that brings in CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but again, CH2 is present.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure that fits all the given NMR data.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic signals: 2H each, so perhaps 2 sets of 2H. So substituents are in para positions.

- Two vinyl-H signals: each with different coupling. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group, but in a way that their protons are different.

- Two CH3 groups: two different methyl groups.

No CH2 groups.

So perhaps each substituent is an ester where R is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, but without any CH2.

Wait, like O-CO-O-CH(CH2CH2...) No, perhaps it's O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. Then each substituent has two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. But then, the methyl groups would be equivalent, giving one peak, but the NMR shows two, so that can't be.

Alternatively, each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. But that brings CH2 into play, which isn't present.

Wait, here's another idea. The substituents might not be directly connected to the ester. Maybe each substituent is a vinyl group connected to the benzene, and the ester is part of a side chain.

Wait, but the IR shows ester, so the ester must be part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group attached to an ester. But that brings in CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like the benzene ring has two ester substituents, each being O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. But that brings in CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm. Maybe the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2, but without any CH2 in the NMR.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think about the number of signals. There are six signals, each integrating to 2H, 2H, etc.

Wait, the aromatic has 2 signals, each 2H. The vinyl has 2 signals, each perhaps 1H and 2H? Wait, no, the NMR has six signals in total: two aromatic (each integrating to 2H), two vinyl (each maybe 1H each?), and two CH3 (each maybe 3H). Wait, but that adds up to 2×2=4H (aromatic), 2×(say, 1H each)=2H (vinyl), and 2×3=6H (CH3), totaling 12 H. 

Wait, the molecular formula must have a total of H as in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option B: C12H14O2 →14 H.

Option C: C12H12O2 →12 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 →12 H.

In the NMR, if the total H is 2×2 (aromatic) + 2×1 (vinyl) + 2×3 (methyl) = 4 +2 +6=12 H, then the molecular formula would have 12 H. So options C and D have 12 H.

Wait, but the aromatic might have more H. Wait, the benzene ring in di-substituted would have 4 aromatic H, but if substituents are para, the four H are in two sets of two. So 4 H in aromatic. Then, the vinyl H could be 2 H (each substituent has one H?), but NMR shows two signals, so perhaps each vinyl group has one H? Or two H in each substituent?

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Let's say each substituent has a vinyl group with one H each. So total 2 H from vinyl. Then, the two methyl groups contribute 6 H. So 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) +6 (methyl) =12 H.

So the formula must have 12 H. So options C (C12H12O2) and D (C11H12O2) have 12 H.

So between C and D.

The degrees of unsaturation for C: 7. For D:6.

The substituents have two ester groups and possibly a double bond.

If each substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, that adds two more double bonds, so total degrees of 3 (benzene) + 2 (ester) +2 (vinyl) =7. So that would require the formula to have 7 degrees, which is option C.

So the formula would be C12H12O2.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula.

Benzene (C6H4) + 2 substituents, each being an ester with a vinyl group.

Each substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is CH2CH2CH2 (but that brings CH2), which is not allowed. Alternatively, R is CH2=CH2, but that brings CH2.

Wait, maybe R is a methyl group. So each substituent is O-CO-O-CH3. Then, each substituent adds 1 C and 3 H.

So benzene (C6H4) + 2*(O-CO-O-CH3) → C6 + 2*(1) = C8. H: 4 (benzene) + 2*(3) =10 H. But O is 2 per substituent, so O=4. But the formula would be C8H10O4, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. Then, each substituent adds 2 C, 5 H. So benzene (C6H4) + 2*(2 C) = C10. H: 4 + 2*(5) =14 H. O: 2 substituents * (2 O from ester) =4 O? But the formula in the options for option B is C12H14O2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH3. Each substituent adds 2 C and 5 H. So benzene (C6H4) plus 2 substituents: C6+4= C10. H: 4 + 2*5=14. O: 2*(2 O from ester) + 2 from the benzene? No, wait, each substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH3, which brings 2 O per substituent. So O is 4. So formula is C10H14O4. Not matching any options.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct formula based on the NMR and IR data.

The presence of an ester group in IR suggests O in the formula. The NMR shows 2 methyl groups (so at least two different CH3 groups), two vinyl groups (so two double bonds), and a para-substituted benzene.

The molecular formula likely has 12 H, so options C and D.

Option C: C12H12O2 → Degrees:7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → Degrees:6.

If the structure has two vinyl groups (each with a double bond), that adds two degrees beyond benzene and esters. So total degrees would be 3 (benzene) + 2 (esters) + 2 (vinyl) =7. So option C.

So the formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C. But wait, the options are listed as:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the $^1$H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups, with no signals for CH$_2$ groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen atom in the structure.

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, where the two substituents create symmetry, resulting in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest the presence of two distinct vinyl groups with different environments.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two different methyl groups in the structure.
   - **Absence of CH$_2$ Signals**: This implies that any CH$_2$ groups in the molecule are either absent or in symmetric environments that do not produce distinct signals.

3. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The molecular formula must account for the benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation), two ester groups (2 degrees), and additional unsaturation from the vinyl groups (2 degrees), totaling 7 degrees of unsaturation.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A (C$_{11}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5. This does not account for the two vinyl groups, so it is incorrect.
   - **Option B (C$_{12}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. This accounts for the benzene ring and two ester groups but not the two vinyl groups, so it is incorrect.
   - **Option C (C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7. This matches the benzene ring (3), two ester groups (2), and two vinyl groups (2), making it the correct choice.
   - **Option D (C$_{11}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. Similar to Option B, this does not account for the two vinyl groups, so it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that satisfies all the given data, including the FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and degrees of unsaturation, is **C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$**.
