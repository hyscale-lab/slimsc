Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again. Hmm, a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh, and the options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute the expectation value for each part, σz and σx, and then combine them with their coefficients.

First, let me note the state. The coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this state is normalized. Let's calculate the square of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately.

I know that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Because the state is expressed in terms of σz eigenstates, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that:

(0.25)(1) + ( (3/4) )*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, right? So in this case, since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, I'll have to compute the expectation value directly.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the inner product of the state with σx acting on the state.

So let me write out the state ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is typically (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, |↑⟩ is (1,0), so 0.5|↑⟩ is (0.5, 0) and sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is the 2x2 matrix that swaps the basis vectors. So σx * ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Wait, no. Let me compute σx multiplied by ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I do σx * ψ, it's:

First component: 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2
Second component: 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5
So σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then the inner product of ψ and σx ψ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.

Wait, that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. So the inner product is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σx ψ. Since ψ is real here, it's just ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So their dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). So that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 is also sqrt(3)/4. So total is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So 5 ⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈4.33.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no: I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the calculation of ⟨σx⟩ is correct. So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So 5 times that is 4.33, but let me be precise.

Wait, but wait: the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10*(−0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = −5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Wait, 5 times (sqrt(3)/2) is 5*(1.732/2) = 5*(0.866) = 4.33, approximately.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.33 ≈-0.67. Wait, that's approximately -0.67, which is close to -0.7. Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is one decimal. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check everything.

Another approach: since the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ is (a b* + a* b ), because σx has expectation value 2 Re(ab* ) when the state is |a, b⟩.

Wait, because σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1 as well, but it's not diagonal in the σz basis. So the expectation value is |a|^2 - |b|^2 for σz, and for σx, it's 2 Re(a b* ), where a and b are the coefficients.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value of σx is 2 Re(a b* ), but wait, let's see.

Wait, |ψ⟩ is a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩. So ψ† is a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|.

So σx is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩ is a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| multiplied by (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) (a |↑⟩ +b |↓⟩ )

Expanding this, the terms would be a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩.

Wait, but ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↓|↑⟩ is also zero. So only the terms where the middle terms are non-zero would be when the ket and bra are the same.

Wait, perhaps another way: when you multiply it out, you get a* b* ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a*) (b) ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (a*) (a) ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + (b*) (b) ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + (b*) (a) ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Wait, no, that's messy. Maybe it's easier to use the formula I mentioned before.

Another approach: for a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ +b |↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2 Re(ab* ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 Re(a b* ), but perhaps I should verify.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it directly. Let's write the state as |ψ⟩ = [ a, b ]^T, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ = [b, a]^T.

The inner product ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩ is a^* b + b^* a.

Since a and b are real in this case, it's just a*b +b*a = 2ab.

So in our case, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2)*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (1)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So 5 times that is 5*(sqrt(3)/2)= approximately 5*(0.866)=4.33.

So the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + 4.33 ≈-0.67. Rounding to one decimal place, that's -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. Let me take sqrt(3) as approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866025. So 5 times that is 4.330125. So 10σz's expectation is 10*(-0.5)= -5. So adding 4.330125 gives -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, which is approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimals. But the question asks for one decimal place, so that would be -0.7.

But wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Let me calculate 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.

So -5 +4.330125 =-0.669875. So approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). Using the coefficients of \( \psi \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the basis states \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). For a state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

The correct option is:

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again. Hmm, a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh, and the options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute the expectation value for each part, σz and σx, and then combine them with their coefficients.

First, let me note the state. The coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this state is normalized. Let's calculate the square of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately.

I know that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Because the state is expressed in terms of σz eigenstates, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that:

(0.25)(1) + ( (3/4) )*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, right? So in this case, since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, I'll have to compute the expectation value directly.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the inner product of the state with σx acting on the state.

So let me write out the state ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is typically (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, |↑⟩ is (1,0), so 0.5|↑⟩ is (0.5, 0) and sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is the 2x2 matrix that swaps the basis vectors. So σx * ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Wait, no. Let me compute σx multiplied by ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I do σx * ψ, it's:

First component: 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2
Second component: 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5
So σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then the inner product of ψ and σx ψ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.

Wait, that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. So the inner product is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σx ψ. Since ψ is real here, it's just ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So their dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). So that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 is also sqrt(3)/4. So total is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So 5 ⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈4.33.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no: I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the calculation of ⟨σx⟩ is correct. So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So 5 times that is 4.33, but let me be precise.

Wait, but wait: the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10*(−0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = −5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Wait, 5 times (sqrt(3)/2) is 5*(1.732/2) = 5*(0.866) = 4.33, approximately.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.33 ≈-0.67. Wait, that's approximately -0.67, which is close to -0.7. Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is one decimal. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check everything.

Another approach: since the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ is (a b* + a* b ), because σx has expectation value 2 Re(ab* ) when the state is |a, b⟩.

Wait, because σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1 as well, but it's not diagonal in the σz basis. So the expectation value is |a|^2 - |b|^2 for σz, and for σx, it's 2 Re(a b* ), where a and b are the coefficients.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value of σx is 2 Re(a b* ), but wait, let's see.

Wait, |ψ⟩ is a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩. So ψ† is a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|.

So σx is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩ is a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| multiplied by (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) (a |↑⟩ +b |↓⟩ )

Expanding this, the terms would be a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩.

Wait, but ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↓|↑⟩ is also zero. So only the terms where the middle terms are non-zero would be when the ket and bra are the same.

Wait, perhaps another way: when you multiply it out, you get a* b* ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a*) (b) ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (a*) (a) ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + (b*) (b) ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + (b*) (a) ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Wait, no, that's messy. Maybe it's easier to use the formula I mentioned before.

Another approach: for a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ +b |↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2 Re(ab* ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 Re(a b* ), but perhaps I should verify.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it directly. Let's write the state as |ψ⟩ = [ a, b ]^T, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ = [b, a]^T.

The inner product ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩ is a^* b + b^* a.

Since a and b are real in this case, it's just a*b +b*a = 2ab.

So in our case, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2)*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (1)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So 5 times that is 5*(sqrt(3)/2)= approximately 5*(0.866)=4.33.

So the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + 4.33 ≈-0.67. Rounding to one decimal place, that's -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. Let me take sqrt(3) as approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866025. So 5 times that is 4.330125. So 10σz's expectation is 10*(-0.5)= -5. So adding 4.330125 gives -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, which is approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimals. But the question asks for one decimal place, so that would be -0.7.

But wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Let me calculate 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.

So -5 +4.330125 =-0.669875. So approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). Using the coefficients of \( \psi \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the basis states \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). For a state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The correct option is:
