Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The movement of the star towards and away from us shifts the spectral lines, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. So both planets have about the same mass. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects these planets. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the shift is related to the velocity of the star. Because a bigger shift (higher velocity) would imply a more massive planet or a closer orbit, I think. But wait, both planets have the same mass. So the difference in velocity must be due to their orbital periods or distances.

I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * (1/(M_s + M_p)^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * sin(i), where M_p is the planet mass, M_s is the star's mass, and P is the orbital period. Oh wait, and sin(i) is the sine of the inclination angle. Since the orbits are circular, I guess i is 90 degrees, so sin(i) is 1.

But wait, since both stars have the same mass (solar masses) and the planets are similar to Neptune, M_p is the same for both. So the formula simplifies a bit. Let's rearrange this formula to relate K, P, and other factors.

Let me write the formula again. K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * sin(i). Wait, but M_p is much smaller than M_s, right? Because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, which is the same for both stars. So that part is the same for both K1 and K2.

So, simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(M_s)^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ). But since M_p and M_s are the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to sqrt( (P2/P1) )? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, for K, the formula is K = (v) which is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_s) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * sin(i). Because the full formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * sin(i), but since M_p is negligible compared to M_s, it's roughly (G*M_p/(M_s))^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) * sin(i).

So, K ∝ (M_p / M_s)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_s are the same for both planets, the (M_p/M_s) term is the same. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1) ^ (-1/3 )

Wait, rearranging: K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

So K1 / K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, the question states that the shift (K) for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7.

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So (K1)/(K2) = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = const / P1^(1/3), K2 = const / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = [ const / P1^(1/3) ] / [ const / P2^(1/3) ] = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1 < K2. Since K is inversely proportional to cube root of P, a higher K would mean a shorter P. Because if K is higher, the star is moving faster, which could mean a shorter orbital period (as the planet is closer in, so it's moving faster around the star).

So, in our case, K2 is larger than K1. So P2 must be smaller than P1. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is higher when the period is shorter, given the same mass.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 / P1 = ?

We have (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(-1/3) ?

Wait, let me double-check the proportionality.

Wait, K = [ (G M_p) / (M_s) ]^(1/3) / (P^(1/3)) ) * sin(i)

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So P ∝ 1/K^(3)

So P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 )

Because P ∝ 1/K^3. So if K increases, P decreases.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, because P2 = (constant) * (1/K2)^3, and P1 = (constant) * (1/K1)^3. So P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, substituting K1 =5, K2=7.

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So this would mean that P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is less than one, meaning P2 is shorter. So the question is about how many times longer is P2. So it's 0.36 times as long, so the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So it's asking for P2 / P1. Which is ~0.36, which makes it shorter. So the answer would be ~0.36 times as long, so about 0.36 times, so option A.

So the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer is A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the inverse of \( K \), or:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method.

The RV method detects these planets. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the shift is related to the velocity of the star. Because a bigger shift (higher velocity) would imply a more massive planet or a closer orbit, I think. But wait, both planets have the same mass. So the difference in velocity must be due to their orbital periods or distances.

I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * (1/(M_s + M_p)^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * sin(i), where M_p is the planet mass, M_s is the star's mass, and P is the orbital period. Oh wait, and sin(i) is the sine of the inclination angle. Since the orbits are circular, I guess i is 90 degrees, so sin(i) is 1.

But wait, since both stars have the same mass (solar masses) and the planets are similar to Neptune, M_p is the same for both. So the formula simplifies a bit. Let's rearrange this formula to relate K, P, and other factors.

Let me write the formula again. K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * sin(i). Wait, but M_p is much smaller than M_s, right? Because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, which is the same for both stars. So that part is the same for both K1 and K2.

So, simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(M_s)^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ). But since M_p and M_s are the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to sqrt( (P2/P1) )? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, for K, the formula is K = (v) which is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_s) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * sin(i). Because the full formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * sin(i), but since M_p is negligible compared to M_s, it's roughly (G*M_p/(M_s))^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) * sin(i).

So, K ∝ (M_p / M_s)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_s are the same for both planets, the (M_p/M_s) term is the same. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1) ^ (-1/3 )

Wait, rearranging: K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

So K1 / K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, the question states that the shift (K) for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7.

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So (K1)/(K2) = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = const / P1^(1/3), K2 = const / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = [ const / P1^(1/3) ] / [ const / P2^(1/3) ] = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1 < K2. Since K is inversely proportional to cube root of P, a higher K would mean a shorter P. Because if K is higher, the star is moving faster, which could mean a shorter orbital period (as the planet is closer in, so it's moving faster around the star).

So, in our case, K2 is larger than K1. So P2 must be smaller than P1. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is higher when the period is shorter, given the same mass.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 / P1 = ?

We have (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(-1/3) ?

Wait, let me double-check the proportionality.

Wait, K = [ (G M_p) / (M_s) ]^(1/3) / (P^(1/3)) ) * sin(i)

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So P ∝ 1/K^(3)

So P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 )

Because P ∝ 1/K^3. So if K increases, P decreases.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, because P2 = (constant) * (1/K2)^3, and P1 = (constant) * (1/K1)^3. So P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, substituting K1 =5, K2=7.

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So this would mean that P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is less than one, meaning P2 is shorter. So the question is about how many times longer is P2. So it's 0.36 times as long, so the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So it's asking for P2 / P1. Which is ~0.36, which makes it shorter. So the answer would be ~0.36 times as long, so about 0.36 times, so option A.

So the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}

This implies that the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the inverse of \( K \), or:

\[

\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:
