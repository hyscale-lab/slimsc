Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. The star has the same radius as the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered with these spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. 

The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are cooler since they have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spot temperature would be 5000K, right? Because 6000K minus 1000K is 5000K. 

The problem states that when only one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations will show brightness variations as the star rotates. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of a star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is asking: if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of an exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Wait, so the situation with the spots causes a certain dip in brightness which mimics a planet transit. But to find the planet radius that gives the same signal, I need to compare the two scenarios.

In the case of a planet transit, the dip in brightness (the signal amplitude) is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2, since the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. That makes sense because the area is πRp² for the planet and πRstar² for the star.

Now, for the star with spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler regions, so when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the observed brightness decreases. The total brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πRstar²σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, so I think that means 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). Wait, the hemisphere has a surface area of 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the area of one hemisphere (the side we can see) is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

When the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spots are facing us (as the star rotates), the observed brightness is a combination of the normal star and the spots.

The brightness variation would be the difference between when the spots are on the side facing us and when they're on the other side. Alternatively, when the spots are in view, the brightness is lower.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star spins, the spotted area alternates between being in our line of sight and not. The brightness variation would depend on how much of the star's surface is covered by spots and their temperature.

The star's brightness when spots are visible is lower than when they aren't. So the amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the maximum brightness (no spots visible) and the minimum brightness (spots visible).

Let me model the brightness. The total flux from the star when no spots are visible is F0 = (Teff^4) * σ * (4πRstar²) / (4πD²) ), but since we are looking for relative changes, maybe I can simplify.

Wait, flux is proportional to the area times the temperature^4. So the star's flux without any spots is F0 = (Rstar²) * (Teff^4). But when a fraction of the surface is covered by spots, the flux changes.

The spots cover a fraction f of the hemisphere, which is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is f * 2πRstar² = 0.2 * 2πRstar² = 0.4πRstar².

The flux when spots are visible is F_spot = (F0 * (1 - f)) + (f * T_spot^4 / Teff^4) * (F0).

Wait, no, because the spots are cooler. So the flux from the spots is lower. Let me think again.

The total flux is the sum of flux from the unspotted areas and the flux from the spotted areas.

The unspotted area when the spots are facing us is (1 - f) * (hemisphere area). Wait, no, the hemisphere area is 2πR². So the area of the hemisphere's surface is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area not covered by spots in the hemisphere is 2πR² -0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

So when the spots are facing us, the flux is:

F = (1.6πR²) * (Teff^4) + (0.4πR²) * (T_spot^4).

But the total area of the star is 4πR². Without any spots, the flux would be F0 = 4πR² * Teff^4.

Wait, no. Because when only the hemisphere is considered, but in reality, the other hemisphere is also there. Wait, no. The star's total flux is always 4πR² * Teff^4, but when the spots are on the near side, perhaps more of the flux is from the cooler areas.

Wait, maybe I should model the flux when the spots are visible and when they are not.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the change in flux when the spots rotate into view.

The maximum brightness occurs when the spots are on the far side of the star, so we see all the unspotted surface. The minimum brightness is when the spots are on the near side, so part of the surface is cooler.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the brightness variation is periodic, with the amplitude being the difference between when the spots are on the near side and when they are on the far side.

So, when the spots are on the far side (not visible), the flux is F_max = (4πR²) * Teff^4.

Wait, no. Because the star's entire surface is emitting. When the spots are on the far side, all the flux we receive is from the unspotted side, right? Or no, because the star is a sphere; when a spot is on the far side, it's not emitting towards us, but the rest is.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way to model it. Let's think about the star as having a surface where only part is cooler. When the star rotates, the cooler regions come into and out of view.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the average flux. The star has a total surface area of 4πR². One hemisphere (2πR²) has spots covering 20% of it, so 0.4πR² area is spots. So the other hemisphere (also 2πR²) is completely unspotted.

So the total flux when the spots are on the near side (facing us) is:

F_spot_visible = (unspotted area on near side) * Teff^4 + (spotted area on near side) * T_spot^4 + (other hemisphere) * Teff^4.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the near side, the other hemisphere is still there.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux as F = (area_unspotted * Teff^4) + (area_spotted * T_spot^4).

But the area_unspotted and area_spotted depend on the hemisphere that's facing us.

Wait, when one hemisphere is spotty. So, when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2πR². Half of that is spots, but no—the spots are 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spotty regions is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area without spots is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is (1.6πR² * Teff^4) + (0.4πR² * T_spot^4).

The other hemisphere isn't spotty, so it contributes 2πR² * Teff^4.

So total flux when spotty hemisphere is facing us:
F_spot = [ (1.6πR² + 2πR²) * Teff^4 ] + (0.4πR² * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)).

Wait, no. Because the unspotty hemisphere contributes 2πR² * Teff^4, and the spotty hemisphere contributes (1.6πR² * Teff^4) + 0.4πR² * T_spot^4.

So total F_spot = 2πR² * Teff^4 + 1.6πR² * Teff^4 + 0.4πR² * T_spot^4.

Wait, but 2πR² is the area of the unspotted hemisphere, and the spotty hemisphere has 1.6πR² unspotted and 0.4πR² spotted.

So F_spot = (2πR² + 1.6πR²) * Teff^4 + 0.4πR² * T_spot^4.

Which is (3.6π R²) Teff^4 + 0.4π R² (T_spot^4).

Without any spots (but in this case, the star has spots, but when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, we don't see the spots), the flux is F_clear = 4π R² Teff^4.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the near side is the unspotty hemisphere. So the flux would be F_clear = 2π R² Teff^4 (the near side) + 2π R² Teff^4 (the far side, which we can't see but doesn't affect our observation). Wait, no. Actually, when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the near side is the unspotty hemisphere, so the flux we receive is 2π R² Teff^4. But without any spots, the flux would be 4π R² Teff^4, but in this scenario, the star's unspotted hemisphere contributes 2π R² Teff^4, and the spotty hemisphere is on the far side. So the maximum flux is 2π R² Teff^4 (when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us), and the minimum is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

The star has two hemispheres: one spotty (with 20% coverage of spots), one unspotty. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = (area of unspotted regions on near side) * Teff^4 + (area of spotted regions on near side) * T_spot^4.

But the other hemisphere (unspotty) is on the far side, so its flux doesn't contribute to our observation. Wait, no, because the far side's light doesn't reach us, but the near side's entire area emits towards us.

Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere. When the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the area we see is the spotty hemisphere (2π R²), which includes the unspotted and spotted regions. The far side's hemisphere (unspotty) is not visible. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (1.6π R²) * Teff^4 + (0.4π R²) * T_spot^4.

And when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotty = 2π R² * Teff^4.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotty = 2π R² Teff^4.

The minimum flux is F_spotty = (1.6π R² Teff^4) + (0.4π R² T_spot^4).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Compute that:

Amplitude A = 2π R² Teff^4 - [1.6π R² Teff^4 + 0.4π R² (5000)^4]

= (2π R² Teff^4 - 1.6π R² Teff^4) - 0.4π R² (5000^4)

= (0.4π R² Teff^4) - 0.4π R² (5000^4)

= 0.4π R² [Teff^4 - (5000)^4 ].

Wait, but Teff is 6000 K, so Teff^4 is (6000)^4, and T_spot is 5000 K, so (5000)^4.

So A = 0.4 π R² [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ].

Now, the amplitude due to the planet transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's flux without any spots. Wait, but in this case, when the star isn't covered by spots, the star's flux would be F0 = 4π Rstar² Teff^4. So the planet transit would block a fraction (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) of F0, giving a dip of (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) F0.

But in our case, the amplitude A from the spots is the change in flux. So we set A equal to the dip from the planet transit, which is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

So:

A = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

But A is 0.4 π R² [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ].

Wait, I need to be careful with the units. Let's make sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute both amplitudes in terms of the same base.

The star's total flux is F0 = 4π R² Teff^4.

The amplitude from the spots is A = F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Which is 2π R² Teff^4 - [ (1.6 π R² Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² (5000)^4) ]

= (0.4 π R² Teff^4) - (0.4 π R² (5000)^4 )

= 0.4 π R² (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

So A = 0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The planet transit amplitude is A_planet = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

F0 is 4π Rstar² Teff^4.

A_planet = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * 4π Rstar² Teff^4 = 4 π Rp^2 Teff^4.

So set A_planet = A:

4 π Rp^2 Teff^4 = 0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, but R is Rstar, since the star's radius is Rstar. So R = Rstar.

Cancel pi from both sides:

4 Rp² Teff^4 = 0.4 Rstar² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Divide both sides by 4:

Rp² Teff^4 = 0.1 Rstar² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Take square roots:

Rp = sqrt( 0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / Teff^4 ) * Rstar.

Wait, let me compute (6000^4 -5000^4).

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So:

Rp² = 0.1 * 6.71e14 / (6e3)^4 * Rstar².

Wait, 6e3 is 6000, so (6e3)^4 is 1.296e15 as above.

So:

Rp² = 0.1 * (6.71e14) / (1.296e15) * Rstar².

Compute 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = approximately 0.5178.

So 0.1 * 0.5178 = 0.05178.

So Rp² = 0.05178 Rstar².

Take square root: Rp = sqrt(0.05178) Rstar.

sqrt(0.05178) is approximately 0.2275.

So Rp ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

Wait, but none of the options are that high. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.2275 is about 0.23, which is not exactly matching any options. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial setup. Let me retrace.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the dip caused by the spots and set it equal to the dip caused by the planet, then find Rp.

The dip in brightness when spots are visible is (delta F)/F0 = [F_unspotty - F_spotty] / F0.

F_unspotty is the maximum flux, F0_unspotty = 2pi R² Teff^4.

F_spotty is the flux when spots are visible, which is (1.6 pi R² Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² (5000)^4).

F0 is the total flux without spots, which is 4 pi R² Teff^4.

So the dip is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F0.

Compute (F_unspotty - F_spotty) = [2 pi R² Teff^4 ] - [ (1.6 pi R² Teff^4) + 0.4 pi R² (5000)^4 ]

= (0.4 pi R² Teff^4 ) - 0.4 pi R² (5000)^4 )

= 0.4 pi R² [Teff^4 - (5000)^4 ]

Divide by F0 = 4 pi R² Teff^4.

So (delta F)/F0 = [0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² (6000^4 ) ]

The pi and R² cancel out:

= (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 * 6000^4 )

= (0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (6000^4 )

= 0.1 [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.1 [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5/6)^4:

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.8333 *0.8333 = 0.6944; 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So (delta F)/F0 ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177.

So the relative dip is about 5.177%.

Now, the planet transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm, but none of the options are 0.23. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) 0.39, B) 0.07, C) 0.11, D) 0.32.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, wait. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². So spots area is 0.4 pi R².

But when the star is viewed, the hemisphere facing us is either the spotty one or the unspotty one.

Wait, another approach: the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is (1 - 0.2)*Teff^4 + 0.2*(T_spot^4) multiplied by the hemisphere's area.

Wait, because the unspotted part is 80% of the hemisphere, so 0.8 * 2 pi R² = 1.6 pi R², but maybe I should think in terms of fractional area.

Alternatively, the effective temperature of the visible hemisphere when spots are present is a weighted average.

The flux from the hemisphere when spots are visible is (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * (area of a hemisphere) / (total area of star).

Wait, that's a different approach. Let's see.

The star's total flux is 4 pi R² Teff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is (hemisphere area) * (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) / (4 pi R²) * 4 pi R² Teff^4.

Wait, no, maybe it's easier to think of the contribution from the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * 2 pi R².

The star's total flux without spots is 4 pi R² Teff^4. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2 pi R².

The flux without any spots (i.e., when the unspotty hemisphere is visible) is 2 pi R² Teff^4.

So the dip is [ (2 pi R² Teff^4) - (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2 pi R² ].

Factor out 2 pi R²:

= 2 pi R² [ Teff^4 - (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ) ]

= 2 pi R² [ 0.2 Teff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2 pi R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

= 0.4 pi R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the relative dip is (0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 pi R² 6e3^4 )

= (0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 * 6e3^4 )

= (0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / 6e3^4

= 0.1 [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

As calculated earlier, [1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.5177.

So relative dip is 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, same as before.

So the dip is about 5.177% of the star's flux.

The planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ Rstar * 0.2275.

Hmm, which is about 0.23 Rstar.

Looking at the options again, I don't see 0.23. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the total area of the star. Let me think again.

Another approach: the variation in brightness due to the spots is (delta F)/F0 = (unspotted area - spotted area) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / F0.

Wait, no, perhaps the variation is the difference between when the spots are on the far side and near side.

When the spot hemisphere is on the far side, the near side is unspotty, so flux is 2 pi R^2 Teff^4.

When the spot hemisphere is near, the flux is (1.6 pi R^2 Teff^4) + (0.4 pi R^2 T_spot^4).

So the difference is (2 pi R^2 Teff^4) - [ 1.6 pi R^2 Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 T_spot^4 ].

Which simplifies to 0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the amplitude is 0.4 pi R^2 (6e3^4 -5e3^4).

The star's total flux F0 is 4 pi R^2 Teff^4.

So the relative amplitude is [0.4 pi R^2 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [4 pi R^2 6e3^4 ]

= [0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [4 *6e3^4 ]

= [0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] /6e3^4

= 0.1 [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) /6e3^4 ]

= 0.1 [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ]

≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177 or 5.177%.

So the dip is 5.177% of the star's flux.

This dip is equivalent to the dip caused by a planet transit.

The dip from a planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, perhaps the answer isn't exactly matching the options because I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of (5/6)^4.

(5/6) is approximately 0.833333.

(0.833333)^2 is approximately 0.694444.

Then, (0.694444)^2 is about 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747, which is about 5.177%.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.05177) = approx 0.2275 times Rstar.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32, but that's larger. Or perhaps I missed something else.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the star's luminosity with spots isn't the same as without. Wait, no, the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots!" So the comparison is between the two situations: the star with spots (causing a 5% dip) and a star without spots but with a planet causing the same dip.

Wait, but wait. The star without spots has a certain flux. The planet transiting in front would block a part of that flux. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the star with spots, the dip is 5.177%.

So the planet dip is the same: 5.177% which means Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption about the filling factor.

Wait, the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². So spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere facing us, the flux is:

(2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² * T_spot^4.

= (1.6 pi R²) Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² (5e3)^4.

Which is what I used earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use the average flux when the star isn't covered by spots. Wait, no. Because in the problem, the star with spots is compared to a star without spots but with a planet.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio (Rp/Rstar) squared equals the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, the dip is 5.177%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D (0.32) but that's larger than 0.23. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the dip.

Wait, another way to think about it: the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. The maximum and minimum brightness would be when the entire hemisphere is unspotty or spotty.

The maximum flux is when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us: 2 pi R² Teff^4.

The minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us: (1.6 pi R² Teff^4) + (0.4 pi R² T_spot^4).

The amplitude (difference) is 0.4 pi R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

The ratio of this amplitude to the star's total flux is (0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 pi R² (6e3)^4 )

= (0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 *6e3^4 )

= (0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (6e3^4 )

Which is the same as 5.177%.

So the dip is about 5.177%, which should be matched by the planet transit dip.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Thus Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 0.39

B) 0.07

C) 0.11

D) 0.32.

Hmm. None of these are close to 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star's actual flux is higher because the spots are cooler, so the variation is actually the star's light compared to when it's not varying.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K. So the flux without spots is 4 pi R² (6000)^4.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is 2 pi R² (0.8 * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4 )

Wait, because the hemisphere area is 2 pi R². 80% of that is 1.6 pi R² at 6000K, and 20% at 5000K.

So flux when spots are visible is:

F = 2 pi R² (0.8 (6000^4) + 0.2 (5000^4) )

The F0 (max) is 2 pi R² (6000^4) (when the other hemisphere is unspotty and the near side is unspotty).

So the dip is F0 - F.

F0 = 2 pi R² (6000^4 )

F = 2 pi R² (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 )

So dip = 2 pi R² [ 6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) ]

= 2 pi R² [ 0.2 *6000^4 -0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before. So the dip is 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4-5e3^4).

Which gives the same 5.177% dip.

So the planet's radius would need to be about 0.2275 Rstar.

But that's not one of the options. Did I miscalculate (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )?

Wait, 6000^4 = (6^4) * (10^3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )= 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So 0.4 pi R² *6.71e14.

Wait, but in the dip calculation, when we divide by F0=4 pi R² (6e3^4 )=4 pi R² *1.296e15.

So the dip is [0.4 pi R² *6.71e14 ] / [4 pi R² *1.296e15 ]

= 0.4 *6.71e14 / (4 *1.296e15 )

= (2.684e14 ) / (5.184e15 ) = approx 0.05177.

So the same 5.177%.

So the planet's radius is sqrt(0.05177) ≈0.2275, which is about 0.23 Rstar.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the star's brightness variation is not only when the spots are visible but also when they're not. Wait no, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is higher because the near side is unspotty.

Wait, another thought: the flux variation is between the maximum and minimum. So when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_max = 2 pi R² Teff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_min = (1.6 pi R² Teff^4) + (0.4 pi R² T_spot^4 )

The amplitude (delta F) is F_max - F_min = 0.4 pi R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The relative amplitude is (delta F) / F0, where F0 is the star's total flux.

But F0 is 4 pi R² Teff^4.

So (delta F)/F0 = [0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² (6e3)^4 ]

= 0.1 [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) / (6e3)^4 ]

Which is 0.1 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) /6e3^4.

As before, 0.1 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ].

So same calculation: 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775%.

Which implies the planet radius is sqrt(0.051775) Rstar, which is about 0.2275 Rstar.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is twice the dip, because when the star rotates, the spots go from being on the far side (maximum brightness) to the near side (minimum brightness). So the total variation is 2*(F_max - F_min) / F0.

Wait, no, because the maximum is F_max and the minimum is F_min, so the amplitude is F_max - F_min.

But perhaps another approach: the star's average flux when spots are present is different. No, because the star's total flux depends on the spot coverage.

Hmm. I'm stuck because none of my calculations align with the given options. Maybe I made an error in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is that the spots are on only one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the star appear dimmer. The amplitude of this variation is the same as the dip caused by a planet transit. So the question is to find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip.

In that case, the dip caused by the spots is (delta F) = 0.05177 F0.

The planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0.

So equate them: (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ Rstar *0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should not consider the entire star's flux but only the hemisphere. Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present, which is:

Fractional change = (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F_unspotty.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, so the dip is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

But F_unspotty is when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, which is 2 pi R² Teff^4.

F_spotty is when the spotty hemisphere is visible: (1.6 pi R² Teff^4) + (0.4 pi R² (5e3)^4 )

So the dip is F_unspotty - F_spotty = 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

The relative dip is 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) / F_unspotty.

F_unspotty is 2 pi R² Teff^4.

So relative dip = [0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [2 pi R² (6e3^4 ) ]

= [0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [ 2 *6e3^4 ]

= [0.2 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] /6e3^4.

= 0.2 [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

So the relative dip is about 10.355%.

Wait, that's different. So if the dip is 10.355%, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which matches option D.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier in the denominator when calculating the relative dip. I should have divided by F_unspotty (the maximum flux) instead of F0 (the total flux without spots).

So the correct approach is:

The maximum flux observed is F_unspotty = 2 pi R² Teff^4.

The minimum flux is F_spotty = (1.6 pi R² Teff^4) + (0.4 pi R² T_spot^4 )

The dip is F_unspotty - F_spotty = 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

The relative dip is (dip) / F_unspotty = [0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [2 pi R² (6e3^4 ) ]

= (0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (2 *6e3^4 )

= 0.2 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) /6e3^4.

= 0.2 [1 - (5/6)^4 ].

Which is 0.2 *0.51775=0.10355 or about 10.355%.

So the planet's dip should be 10.355% of F_unspotty.

But wait, the planet's dip is relative to the total flux of the star when it's not covered by spots. Because when calculating planet transit, it's (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is 4 pi R² Teff^4.

Wait, but the star with spots has F0 =4 pi R² Teff^4 as well. So the dip from the planet would be (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

So setting this equal to the dip from the spots: (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0 = dip from spots.

dip from spots is 0.10355 * F_unspotty.

But F_unspotty is 2 pi R² Teff^4. And F0 is 4 pi R^2 Teff^4.

So 0.10355 * F_unspotty = 0.10355 *2 pi R² Teff^4 = 0.2071 pi R² Teff^4.

The dip from the planet is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 pi R² Teff^4.

Set them equal:

(Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 pi R² Teff^4 =0.2071 pi R² Teff^4.

Cancel pi R² Teff^4 from both sides:

4 Rp^2 =0.2071.

Rp^2= 0.2071 /4 =0.051775.

Rp= sqrt(0.051775 ) Rstar ≈0.2275 Rstar.

Which brings me back to the same 0.23 value.

Wait, but that can't be. Because earlier approach gave me a different result.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing two different definitions of the dip.

In the case of the star with spots, the dip is relative to the star's maximum brightness (F_unspotty). For the planet, the dip is relative to the star's total brightness (F0).

So perhaps the correct approach is to compare the dip from the spots (relative to F0) and the dip from the planet (relative to F0).

Wait, but when the star has spots, the maximum observed brightness is F_unspotty. So the dip is the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty, which is dip_spot = F_unspotty - F_spotty.

The dip_spot as a fraction of F0 is dip_spot / F0 = [F_unspotty - F_spotty ] / F0.

Which is [0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² (6e3^4 ) ].

Which is 0.1*(6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) /6e3^4.

That's 5.177%.

So the dip from the spots is 5.177% of F0.

The dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.05177 → Rp=0.2275 Rstar.

But if I instead calculate the dip as a fraction of F_unspotty, I get a larger dip, which may not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the dip is relative to F0 or relative to F_unspotty.

In the case of the star with spots, the observed brightness varies between F_unspotty and F_spotty. So the amplitude is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

The planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

But when the star isn't covered by spots, F0 is the same as when the star is unspotty, because F0 is the total flux without any spots.

So the amplitude from the spots is dip_spot = F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Which is 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

So dip_spot = 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

The planet's dip is dip_planet = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) * F0.

Set dip_spot = dip_planet.

So 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 pi R² (6e3^4 )

Cancel 4 pi R² on both sides:

0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 (6e3^4 )

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) *4 pi R² (6e3^4 )

Cancel pi R² on both sides:

0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) *4 (6e3^4 )

So 0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) / (4 (6e3^4 )) ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 )

Which is 0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) / (6e3^4 )

= 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177.

So Rp = sqrt(0.05177) Rstar ≈0.2275 Rstar.

So again, the same value.

But none of the options are close.

Looking back, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of (6000^4 -5000^4 ). Let me recompute that accurately.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So 0.05177 * F0 = 0.05177 *4 pi R² (6e3^4 )

So dip_spot =0.4 pi R² *6.71e14.

But dip_planet= (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) *4 pi R² (6e3^4 )

So,

0.4 pi R² *6.71e14 = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) *4 pi R² *1.296e15.

Cancel pi R².

0.4 *6.71e14 = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 *1.296e15.

Divide both sides by 4:

0.1 *6.71e14 = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *1.296e15.

So,

Rp^2 / Rstar^2 = (0.1 *6.71e14 ) / (1.296e15 )

= (0.671e14 ) / (1.296e15 ) = 0.671 / 12.96 → approximately 0.05177.

So again, Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm. So the correct answer isn't in the options, but perhaps the intended approach was to calculate the dip as a fraction of the star's total flux, leading to a planet radius of about 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Maybe the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes.

When the star is unspotty, flux is F_unspotty =2 pi R² (6e3^4).

When the star is spotty, flux is F_spotty = (1.6 pi R² (6e3^4) ) + (0.4 pi R² (5e3^4 )).

So the difference is F_unspotty - F_spotty =0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4).

The maximum and minimum fluxes are F_unspotty and F_spotty. So the amplitude is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

The relative amplitude is (F_unspotty - F_spotty)/F0, where F0 is the star's total flux without spots, which is 4 pi R² (6e3^4).

So,

(F_unspotty - F_spotty)/F0 = [0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4)] / [4 pi R² (6e3^4 ) ]

= [0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [4 *6e3^4 ]

= [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [10 *6e3^4 ]

= (1.296e15 -6.25e14 ) / (1.296e15 *10 )

= (6.71e14 ) / (1.296e16 ) → approximately 0.05177.

So again, the same 5.177%.

So the planet's radius is 0.2275 Rstar.

Given that, but the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11. But that would be sqrt(0.0121)= 0.11 Rstar, but that's much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the area is incorrect.

Another approach: perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 *4 pi R².

But the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So it's 20% of that hemisphere, not the entire star.

So the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the brightness variation as a result of the entire star's surface being covered with spots, but that's not the case.

I'm a bit stuck here. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem asks for the radius relative to the star's radius, but I got 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23, not listed. But option D is 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (delta F)/F0 again.

delta F = F_unspotty - F_spotty =0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

F0=4 pi R² (6e3^4 )

So (delta F)/F0 = [0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² (6e3^4 ) ]

= (0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 *6e3^4 )

= (0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / 6e3^4.

= 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 )= 0.1 *0.5177=0.05177.

So the dip is 5.177% of F0.

So for the planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.05177 → Rp=0.2275 Rstar.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is about the star's effective temperature, and the spots don't contribute to the total flux, but the question is about the apparent brightness variation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in brightness as ( (F_unspotty - F_spotty) ) / F_unspotty.

Which would be (0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (2 pi R² (6e3^4 ) )

= [0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) ] / [ 2 *6e3^4 ]

= 0.2 [ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) /6e3^4 ]

= 0.2 *0.5177=0.10355 →10.355%.

So the dip is 10.355% of F_unspotty.

So for the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 *F0.

Set (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0 = dip_spot.

F0 is 4 pi R² (6e3^4 ), dip_spot is 0.10355 * F_unspotty =0.10355 *2 pi R² (6e3^4 )=0.2071 pi R² (6e3^4 )

So:

(Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 pi R² (6e3^4 ) = 0.2071 pi R² (6e3^4 )

Cancel pi R² (6e3^4 ):

4 Rp^2 =0.2071 → Rp^2 =0.051775 → Rp=0.2275 Rstar.

Same result again. So I'm confident that my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the correct answer is approximately 0.23, but since it's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest option, which isn't present.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation isn't only when the spots are on the near side but also when they rotate, so the amplitude is twice the dip I calculated.

Wait, no. The maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is a result of the spots being on the hemisphere, and the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the near side and far side.

So, the amplitude would be F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Which is 0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

But the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 *F0.

So,

(Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) *4 pi R² (6e3^4 )=0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

Cancel pi R² (6e3^4 ):

4 Rp^2 (6e3^4 )=0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

Divide both sides by 4:

Rp^2 (6e3^4 )=0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

Rp^2= 0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )/(6e3^4 )

=0.1 [1 - (5/6)^4 ]=0.1 *0.5177=0.05177.

Rp= sqrt(0.05177 ) Rstar≈0.2275.

Again, same result.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ). Let me recompute:

6e3 =6000.

5e3=5000.

Compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6^4) * (1000^4 )=1296 *1e12=1.296e15.

5000^4: 5^4=625, so 625e12=6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4=1.296e15 -6.25e14=6.71e14.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem intended the spot temperature to be 1000K cooler than the star's Teff, but perhaps I used the wrong T_spot.

Wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spot's temperature is 5000K. Correct.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't have the right value. Since the closest option is D) ~0.32, but that's larger than 0.23, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the initial mistake is in the area calculation. Let me double-check:

Total area of the star: 4 pi R².

Filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area: 2 pi R².

Spot area: 0.2 *2 pi R²=0.4 pi R².

So when the spot hemisphere is visible, the area contributing is 0.4 pi R² at T_spot.

So the flux is:

Flux = (2 pi R² -0.4 pi R² ) *Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² *T_spot^4.

= 1.6 pi R² Teff^4 +0.4 pi R² T_spot^4.

When the unspotty hemisphere is visible, flux is 2 pi R² Teff^4.

So the dip is 2 pi R² Teff^4 - [1.6 pi R² Teff^4 +0.4 pi R² T_spot^4 ]= 0.4 pi R² (Teff^4 -T_spot^4 ).

So the dip is correct.

Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, the closest is C) 0.11, which is 0.11 Rstar. But 0.11² is 0.0121, which would correspond to a dip of 1.21%, which is much smaller than the 5.177% dip we have.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the planet's radius to produce the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation, which would be when the planet covers the same area as the spots.

The area covered by spots is 0.4 pi R².

The area of the planet is pi (Rp)^2.

So setting pi Rp^2 =0.4 pi R² → Rp^2=0.4 R² → Rp= sqrt(0.4 ) Rstar ≈0.632 Rstar.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the planet's radius is such that the area blocked is the same as the area of the spots.

But in that case, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.4) Rstar, which is ~0.632 Rstar, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct calculation leads to Rp=0.2275 Rstar, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as a percentage of the star's flux without spots.

In that case, the dip_spot is 5.177% of F0.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.05177 → Rp=0.2275 Rstar.

So again, no matching option.

Given that, I think the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the intended option is C) ~0.11. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the dip.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses a different formula for the amplitude. Maybe the amplitude is (area of spots) * (1 - T_spot/Teff)^2.

But that would be:

Area=0.4 pi R².

Amplitude= 0.4 pi R² (1 - (5000/6000))^2.

= 0.4 pi R² (1 - (5/6))^2.

=0.4 pi R² (1/6)^2.

=0.4 pi R² (1/36 )= (0.4/36) pi R² ≈0.01111 pi R².

So dip relative to F0 is (0.01111 pi R² ) / (4 pi R² ) = 0.002777, which is 0.2777% dip.

So the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.002777 )=0.0527 Rstar, which is about 0.05, close to option B) 0.07.

But this approach doesn't seem correct.

I think I've spent enough time on this, and the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 0.23 Rstar, which isn't an option. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as a star with dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots have a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The goal is to find the exoplanet radius \( R_{\text{pl}} \) relative to the star's radius \( R_{\text{star}} \) such that the brightness variation caused by the planet transit matches the variation caused by the spots.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star with Spots**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and one hemisphere (area \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \)) has spots covering 20% of its area, i.e., \( 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2) T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
   - When the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotty}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The amplitude of brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)
     \]
   - The relative amplitude is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.05177 \, \text{(or } 5.177\%)
     \]

2. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F_{\text{planet}}}{F_0} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
     \]
   - Setting \( \frac{\Delta F_{\text{planet}}}{F_0} = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.05177
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2275
     \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - The closest option is **C) ~0.11**, but this is significantly smaller than the calculated value. None of the other options (A: ~0.39, B: ~0.07, D: ~0.32) are close to the calculated value either.

### Conclusion:
The calculations consistently yield \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \), but since this value is not listed among the options, the closest match is **C) ~0.11**. However, this choice is not ideal and may indicate an issue with the problem's provided options.
