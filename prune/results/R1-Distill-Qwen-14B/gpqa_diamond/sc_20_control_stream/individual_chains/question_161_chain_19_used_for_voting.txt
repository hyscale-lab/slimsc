Okay, so I have this question about transmission electron microscopy, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment because they can interfere with the electron beam. But even so, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, considering things like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting: the mean free path changes. It's now λ2 instead of λ1, but the temperature is the same. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1.

Hmm, let's think about what mean free path means. The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, gas molecules would have a longer mean free path because there are fewer other molecules to collide with. But when the electron beam is turned on, I guess something else is happening.

Wait, the electron beam itself emits electrons. Those electrons might interact with the gas molecules in the compartment. So instead of the gas molecules just bouncing off each other, they're now also being hit by electrons from the beam. That should cause more frequent collisions, right?

So, normally, the mean free path is calculated based on the gas's own pressure, temperature, and so on. But when the beam is on, the gas molecules are also being bombarded by electrons. Each collision with an electron would be like another "collision event" from their perspective. So the mean free path would decrease because the effective number of collisions increases.

Oh wait, but the mean free path is inversely proportional to the number of collisions. So more collisions (like from the electrons) would mean a shorter mean free path. So λ2 should be smaller than λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That makes sense because the electron beam adds more ways for the gas molecules to collide, decreasing their mean free path.

Wait, but could the electrons cause the gas to ionize or something else? Like, maybe the gas becomes charged and behaves differently? Hmm, but regardless, the primary effect here is that the electron beam adds more scattering events. So more collisions mean the mean free path is shorter. So λ2 is less than λ1.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum is the average distance they travel between collisions. Initially, Mike determined the mean free path as λ1 under the ultra-high vacuum conditions in the TEM sample compartment, based on factors like pressure, temperature, and volume. However, when the electron beam was activated, an additional factor came into play: the gas molecules began interacting with the electrons from the beam. These interactions introduced additional collision events, increasing the effective number of collisions the gas molecules experienced. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the number of collisions, the increased collision frequency due to the electron beam caused the mean free path to decrease. Thus, λ2, the mean free path under the electron beam, is smaller than λ1.

From the given options, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
