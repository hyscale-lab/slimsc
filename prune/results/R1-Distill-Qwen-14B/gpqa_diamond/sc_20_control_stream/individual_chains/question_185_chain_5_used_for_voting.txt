Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved here, and they're used in spin systems.

Wait, right. The Pauli vector is a vector whose components are the Pauli matrices. So σ · n would be the dot product of σ and n. Oh, right, that would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix because Pauli matrices are 2x2.

Since H is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues should be two in number. I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues and the determinant is their product. But wait, perhaps there's a more straightforward way.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are each Hermitian and have eigenvalues ±1. So if I have σ · n, which is a linear combination of them, what's the eigenvalue? Let me think. Since σ · n is a Hermitian operator (because each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and n is real), so H is Hermitian, which makes sense because Hamiltonians are always Hermitian.

The eigenvalues of σ · n would be the eigenvalues of each term. But wait, the square of σ · n is (σ · n)^2. Let's calculate that. Oh right, because (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y +n_z σ_z)^2.

Expanding that, each σ_i squared is the identity matrix I, because σ_i^2 = I for each Pauli matrix. So, (σ · n)^2 = n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + terms involving σ_i σ_j for i≠j. Wait, but those cross terms might involve commutators. Alternatively, I remember that (σ · n)^2 = (n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2 =1. So (σ · n)^2 = I.

Wait, that's a key point. So H^2 = ε^2 (σ · n)^2 = ε^2 I. So H squared is ε squared times identity matrix. So when we take the eigenvalues of H, let's say the eigenvalues are E. Then E^2 = ε^2, so E = ±ε. That makes sense.

Oh wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If H^2 is ε² I, then each eigenvalue E of H must satisfy E² = ε². So E can be ε or -ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. Option C has ε multiplied by hbar over 2. Why would that be? Oh, perhaps because sometimes the spin matrices are considered with a factor involving hbar/2. Wait, in spin systems, the Pauli matrices are sometimes multiplied by ħ/2. But in this problem, H is given as ε σ · n. So σ is the Pauli vector, which has each component as the Pauli matrix. So if the Pauli matrices are scaled by ħ/2, then the eigenvalues would be (ε)(ħ/2) * (±1). But in the given problem, the Hamiltonian is ε multiplied by σ · n. So I think the standard Pauli matrices are used, which have eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of σ · n would be +1 and -1. Then, when scaled by ε, H's eigenvalues would be ±ε. So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and each has trace zero and determinant -1. So σ · n is a matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1. Correct. So H = ε (σ · n) has eigenvalues ε *1 and ε*(-1) → ±ε. So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) is the Pauli spin vector and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\). The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, weighted by the components of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\). 

Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the square of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{n} I = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\). When scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect unless the Pauli matrices are scaled by \(\hbar/2\), which is not specified in the problem.
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
