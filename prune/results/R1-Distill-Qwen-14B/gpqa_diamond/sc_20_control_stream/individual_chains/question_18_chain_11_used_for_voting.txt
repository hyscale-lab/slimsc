--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question asks.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass larger than our Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But I think the mass might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances, which are given using the EW method, assuming LTE. So maybe the mass info is just extra.

The elemental abundances are given as:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → So, log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) or the other way? Wait, wait, I need to clarify. Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2, I think. So [Si in Star_1] divided by [Si in Star_2].

Hmm. So the approach would be to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio of their Silicon to H ratios.

Wait, but how do I get [Si/H] for each star from the given data?

Let me think. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of element X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, the correct formula is [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun )

So, [X/Y] = log10( (nX_star / nY_star) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) )

Which can be rewritten as [X/Y] = log10( (nX_star / nY_star) ) - log10( nX_sun /nY_sun )

But I think another approach is to use the fact that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means that the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as the solar ratio. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → log10(nFe_1/nH_1) - log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )= 0 → log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. Which makes sense since [Fe/H] is 0.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Now, for Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log10( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, because [Fe/H]_1 =0, so nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express the ratios in terms of solar.

Let me try to get [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( nSi_1 / nFe_1 ) = log10( nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) + 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, log10(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun /nH_sun). Let me denote this as log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = A, where A is the solar value.

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun, since nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Wait, the Sun's data: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5. So nFe_sun = nH_sun * 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1:

nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nH_1 * (1e-4.5).

So [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → log10( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) ) = log10( (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) +0.3.

But nSi_sun / nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * (nH_sun / nFe_sun). Let me compute that.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 /nFe_1) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But from [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nH_1 * (1e-4.5).

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

Then, nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

So substituting, nSi_1 = (nH_1 * 1e-4.5) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, but nSi_sun/nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nFe_sun) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H] for each star.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log10( nSi_1 /nH_1 ) - log10( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

We need to find [Si/H]_1. Let's see if we can express this.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10( (nSi_1/nFe_1)/(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

But nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

= (nH_1 *1e-4.5 ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Now, [Si/H]_1 is log10( nSi_1 /nH_1 ) - log10( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Which is log10( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

= log10( (nSi_1 / nH_1) ) - log10( nSi_sun / nH_sun )

= [log10(nSi_1) - log10(nH_1)] - [ log10(nSi_sun) - log10(nH_sun) ]

= log10(nSi_1) - log10(nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun) + log10(nH_sun)

= log10(nSi_1 / nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So [Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) 

But from earlier, nSi_1 = (nH_1 *1e-4.5 ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *1e0.3.

Wait, nSi_sun is nSi in the Sun's photosphere. Let's compute nSi_sun /nFe_sun.

nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun is another value. Wait, do we have the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Wait, the Sun's photospheric data given is for Fe and Mg. Let me recheck.

The Sun's data is:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)= -4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5.

So nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? The problem doesn't give it directly. So perhaps I need to relate Si to Fe and Mg in the Sun.

Wait, perhaps Si is not directly given, but in Stellar atmospheres, elements are often grouped by their abundances. Maybe I can assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero? Or perhaps I can compute it using another given value.

Wait, wait, the problem doesn't provide the Sun's [Si/Fe] or [Si/H]. Hmm. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is 0, meaning nSi_sun /nFe_sun = 1. But that's not necessarily correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible that the solar [Mg/Si] is known, but that's not given either.

Wait, the given data for the Sun is only for Fe and Mg. So perhaps I need to compute [Si/Fe] in the Sun from another source, or perhaps the problem expects me to assume that [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 for Star_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) = nH_2 * 1e-5.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10( nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = log10(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3.

So,

nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nMg_2 = nH_2 *1e-5.

So,

(nH_2 *1e-5 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 1e0.3.

Solving for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 ]

= (nH_2 * 1e-5 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *1e0.3 )

But we can express nSi_sun in terms of nMg_sun if we know [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) → so nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^{ [Mg/Si]_sun }.

But the problem doesn't give [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm. So perhaps I'm stuck here.

Wait, maybe the key is that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is a certain value, but since it's not provided, perhaps it's not needed, or perhaps I'm supposed to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, perhaps let's find [Si/H] for both stars.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1 )

= [ (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 ] * [nFe_sun/nH_sun ]

= (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = log10( 10^0.3 ) = 0.3.

Wait, that's neat. So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Wait, let me check that. Because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 +0 =0.3.

Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

Yes, because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]. So if [Fe/H]_1=0, then [Si/H]= [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1= 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0, and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

So [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2 → 0=0.3 + [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2 is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

But wait, the ratio is (nSi_1 / nSi_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But because we can express (nSi_1/nH_1) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + 12 } because [Si/H] = 12 + log10(nSi/nH) -12 → no, wait.

Wait, [X/H] is defined as log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun.

But the problem gives 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which is log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - (-4.5) → but for the Sun, [Fe/H]=0.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to express [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX,nH)_sun.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of numbers.

The Sun's log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3.

We don't know nSi_sun/nH_sun, but perhaps we can calculate it from the given data for the Sun. Because the Sun's [Mg/Si] is (nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log10( (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)_sun ) → wait, no, that's not right. Wait, [Mg/Si] for the Sun would be [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) → that would be zero. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given by the ratio of their abundances. Since the Sun's nMg/nH is 1e-5, and nFe/nH is 1e-4.5. But without nSi/nH, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

So for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

Which implies (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *1e0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun/nH_sun) = nH_2 *1e-5.

So substituting:

( (nH_2 *1e-5) /nSi_2 ) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

Rearranging, nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 ]

Which is nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) * 1e-0.3.

Now, nSi_sun /nMg_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) = (nSi/nH)_sun * (1/(nMg/nH)_sun )

= (nSi/nH)_sun * (1/(1e-5)) ) → because (nMg/nH)_sun=1e-5.

So,

nSi_sun /nMg_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e5.

But then, let's plug that back:

nSi_2 = nH_2 *1e-5 * [ (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e5 ] *1e-0.3.

= nH_2 *1e-5 * (nSi/nH)_sun *1e5 *1e-0.3.

= nH_2 * (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e-0.3.

But (nSi/nH)_sun = 10^( [Si/H]_sun +12 ) ?

Wait, wait. Because [Si/H]_sun = log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ? No, because [Si/H] is defined as log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun), which would be zero for the Sun. So for the Sun, [Si/H]_sun =0 → log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = 12 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -12 → no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/H] is zero, so (nSi_sun/nH_sun) = 10^{12} * 1e- whatever? Wait, the original data for the Sun is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 and same for Mg. So for Fe, log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But for Si, we don't have the Sun's data. Hmm. So perhaps I can't proceed this way.

Alternative approach: since we can't compute [Si/H] for the Sun, but perhaps the ratio of [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 can be used.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for Star_1, [Si/H]=0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H]=-0.3. Is that correct?

Let me double-check that.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *1e0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1 ) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun *1e0.3) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun )

= (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *1e0.3.

Which is nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *1e0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( nSi_1/nH_1 ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) = log10( (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *1e0.3 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log10(1e0.3) =0.3.

Yes, so [Si/H]_1=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2 ) = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 = nH_2 *1e-5.

So,

nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 → (nH_2 *1e-5 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

Rearranging,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 ].

= (nH_2 *1e-5 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *1e0.3 )

Now, what is nMg_sun /nSi_sun?

That's (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun )

= (1e-5) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun )

But [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) → nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^{ [Mg/Si]_sun }

But we don't know [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_sun as log10( (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ) ) → which is log10( (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun ) → which is [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (nMg/nH)_sun ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )

But (nMg/nH)_sun =1e-5, and (nSi/nH)_sun is X, which we don't know.

So,

[Mg/Si]_sun = log10(1e-5 ) - log10(X ) = (-5 ) - log10(X )

But without knowing [Mg/Si]_sun, this might not help.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Let's express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2 ) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

We can write nMg_2 =nH_2 *1e-5.

So,

(nMg_2/nSi_2 ) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 → (nH_2 *1e-5 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

Solving for nSi_2,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *1e-5 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *1e0.3 )

But,

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun is something we don't know.

But maybe we can relate [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =nH_2 *1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

So,

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

But nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / ( (1e-5 *nH_sun / nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *1e-5 ) * nSi_sun / ( nH_sun *1e-5 *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun * 1e0.3 )

But,

(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_sun +12 } ? Wait, no:

Wait, [Si/H]_sun is log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) → zero. Because [X/H]_sun=0.

Wait, no. [X/H]_sun is zero by definition, because it's the solar abundance. So,

log10(nX_sun/nH_sun ) = 12 + log10(nX_sun/nH_sun ) -12 → no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the way the problem is given, for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, nMg/nH=1e-5.

But for Si, we don't have [Si/H]_sun, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute it based on the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun, which I don't know, but perhaps it's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I can get [Si/H]_2 from [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Wait, that seems promising. Let's see.

Because,

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → because [X/Y] = [X/Z] - [Y/Z].

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

So,

0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Yes, that makes sense.

So Star_1 has [Si/H]=0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H]=-0.3.

Thus, the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2 is (nSi_1/(nH_1)) / (nSi_2/(nH_2)) ) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

Which can be written as 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } / 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } } → because [Si/H] is the log10(nSi/nH) relative to the Sun.

Wait, because [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1 ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Similarly for [Si/H]_2.

So, 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

And 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } = (nSi_2/nH_2 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^{ [Si/H]_1 } * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ] / [10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ] 

= 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Which is,

10^{ 0.3 - (-0.3) } =10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98 ~4.0.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is close to option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but why is the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2 )? Because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Wait, wait, no. Because the ratio (nSi_1/(nH_1)) / (nSi_2/(nH_2)) ) is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1 *nH_2 )/(nH_1 *nSi_2 )

But the actual ratio of silicon atoms (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) would be (nSi_1/nH_1 )/(nSi_2/nH_2 ) multiplied by (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But wait, we don't know anything about the ratio of H in the two stars. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, we can't compute the ratio of Si atoms. Because the abundance ratios depend on the total number of atoms.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of H atoms is the same in both stars, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which would correspond to the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

But then, unless the H densities are same, which isn't given, this can't be determined.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the H is the same in both stars, which would make their photospheric H counts equal. But the question doesn't state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

= (nSi_1 *nH_2 )/(nH_1 *nSi_2 )

= (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But without knowing the ratio of H in the stars, we can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only concerned with the ratio of Si relative to H in each star, and not their absolute numbers. So, if [Si/H]_1=0.3, and [Si/H]_2=-0.3, the ratio of (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2 )=10^{0.6} ~3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, that would be (nSi_1)/(nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nSi_2 )

But unless nH_1 =nH_2, we can't proceed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star, so perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the ratio is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ), which gives 10^{0.6}=~3.98.

So the answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ) - log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)_sun.

### Step 1: Abundance Ratios for Star_1
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means the Fe-to-H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., nFe₁/nH₁ = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we have:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{Fe}}_1) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}) + 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \(n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot} \cdot (n_{\text{H}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_{\odot})\), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_1 = (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3}
  \]
  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_1 is:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3
  \]

### Step 2: Abundance Ratios for Star_2
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means the Mg-to-H ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., nMg₂/nH₂ = nMg_sun/nH_sun.
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we have:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}_2 / n_{\text{Si}}_2) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}) + 0.3
  \]
  Rearranging, we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}_2 = (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}
  \]
  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_2 is:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3
  \]

### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_1)}{(n_{\text{Si}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}_2)} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
Substituting \([\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3\) and \([\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3\), we get:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question asks.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass larger than our Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But I think the mass might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances, which are given using the EW method, assuming LTE. So maybe the mass info is just extra.

The elemental abundances are given as:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → So, log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) or the other way? Wait, wait, I need to clarify. Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2, I think. So [Si in Star_1] divided by [Si in Star_2].

Hmm. So the approach would be to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio of their Silicon to H ratios.

Wait, but how do I get [Si/H] for each star from the given data?

Let me think. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of element X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, the correct formula is [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun )

So, [X/Y] = log10( (nX_star / nY_star) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) )

Which can be rewritten as [X/Y] = log10( (nX_star / nY_star) ) - log10( nX_sun /nY_sun )

But I think another approach is to use the fact that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means that the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as the solar ratio. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → log10(nFe_1/nH_1) - log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )= 0 → log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. Which makes sense since [Fe/H] is 0.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Now, for Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log10( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, because [Fe/H]_1 =0, so nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express the ratios in terms of solar.

Let me try to get [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( nSi_1 / nFe_1 ) = log10( nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) + 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, log10(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun /nH_sun). Let me denote this as log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = A, where A is the solar value.

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun, since nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Wait, the Sun's data: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5. So nFe_sun = nH_sun * 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1:

nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nH_1 * (1e-4.5).

So [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → log10( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) ) = log10( (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) +0.3.

But nSi_sun / nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * (nH_sun / nFe_sun). Let me compute that.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 /nFe_1) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But from [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nH_1 * (1e-4.5).

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

Then, nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

So substituting, nSi_1 = (nH_1 * 1e-4.5) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, but nSi_sun/nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nFe_sun) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H] for each star.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log10( nSi_1 /nH_1 ) - log10( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

We need to find [Si/H]_1. Let's see if we can express this.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10( (nSi_1/nFe_1)/(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

But nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

= (nH_1 *1e-4.5 ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Now, [Si/H]_1 is log10( nSi_1 /nH_1 ) - log10( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Which is log10( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

= log10( (nSi_1 / nH_1) ) - log10( nSi_sun / nH_sun )

= [log10(nSi_1) - log10(nH_1)] - [ log10(nSi_sun) - log10(nH_sun) ]

= log10(nSi_1) - log10(nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun) + log10(nH_sun)

= log10(nSi_1 / nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So [Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) 

But from earlier, nSi_1 = (nH_1 *1e-4.5 ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *1e0.3.

Wait, nSi_sun is nSi in the Sun's photosphere. Let's compute nSi_sun /nFe_sun.

nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun is another value. Wait, do we have the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Wait, the Sun's photospheric data given is for Fe and Mg. Let me recheck.

The Sun's data is:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)= -4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5.

So nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? The problem doesn't give it directly. So perhaps I need to relate Si to Fe and Mg in the Sun.

Wait, perhaps Si is not directly given, but in Stellar atmospheres, elements are often grouped by their abundances. Maybe I can assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero? Or perhaps I can compute it using another given value.

Wait, wait, the problem doesn't provide the Sun's [Si/Fe] or [Si/H]. Hmm. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is 0, meaning nSi_sun /nFe_sun = 1. But that's not necessarily correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible that the solar [Mg/Si] is known, but that's not given either.

Wait, the given data for the Sun is only for Fe and Mg. So perhaps I need to compute [Si/Fe] in the Sun from another source, or perhaps the problem expects me to assume that [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 for Star_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) = nH_2 * 1e-5.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10( nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = log10(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3.

So,

nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nMg_2 = nH_2 *1e-5.

So,

(nH_2 *1e-5 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 1e0.3.

Solving for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 ]

= (nH_2 * 1e-5 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *1e0.3 )

But we can express nSi_sun in terms of nMg_sun if we know [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) → so nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^{ [Mg/Si]_sun }.

But the problem doesn't give [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm. So perhaps I'm stuck here.

Wait, maybe the key is that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is a certain value, but since it's not provided, perhaps it's not needed, or perhaps I'm supposed to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, perhaps let's find [Si/H] for both stars.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1 )

= [ (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 ] * [nFe_sun/nH_sun ]

= (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = log10( 10^0.3 ) = 0.3.

Wait, that's neat. So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Wait, let me check that. Because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 +0 =0.3.

Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

Yes, because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]. So if [Fe/H]_1=0, then [Si/H]= [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1= 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0, and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

So [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2 → 0=0.3 + [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2 is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

But wait, the ratio is (nSi_1 / nSi_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But because we can express (nSi_1/nH_1) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + 12 } because [Si/H] = 12 + log10(nSi/nH) -12 → no, wait.

Wait, [X/H] is defined as log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun.

But the problem gives 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which is log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - (-4.5) → but for the Sun, [Fe/H]=0.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to express [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX,nH)_sun.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of numbers.

The Sun's log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3.

We don't know nSi_sun/nH_sun, but perhaps we can calculate it from the given data for the Sun. Because the Sun's [Mg/Si] is (nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log10( (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)_sun ) → wait, no, that's not right. Wait, [Mg/Si] for the Sun would be [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) → that would be zero. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given by the ratio of their abundances. Since the Sun's nMg/nH is 1e-5, and nFe/nH is 1e-4.5. But without nSi/nH, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

So for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

Which implies (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *1e0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun/nH_sun) = nH_2 *1e-5.

So substituting:

( (nH_2 *1e-5) /nSi_2 ) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

Rearranging, nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 ]

Which is nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) * 1e-0.3.

Now, nSi_sun /nMg_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) = (nSi/nH)_sun * (1/(nMg/nH)_sun )

= (nSi/nH)_sun * (1/(1e-5)) ) → because (nMg/nH)_sun=1e-5.

So,

nSi_sun /nMg_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e5.

But then, let's plug that back:

nSi_2 = nH_2 *1e-5 * [ (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e5 ] *1e-0.3.

= nH_2 *1e-5 * (nSi/nH)_sun *1e5 *1e-0.3.

= nH_2 * (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e-0.3.

But (nSi/nH)_sun = 10^( [Si/H]_sun +12 ) ?

Wait, wait. Because [Si/H]_sun = log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ? No, because [Si/H] is defined as log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun), which would be zero for the Sun. So for the Sun, [Si/H]_sun =0 → log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = 12 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -12 → no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/H] is zero, so (nSi_sun/nH_sun) = 10^{12} * 1e- whatever? Wait, the original data for the Sun is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 and same for Mg. So for Fe, log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But for Si, we don't have the Sun's data. Hmm. So perhaps I can't proceed this way.

Alternative approach: since we can't compute [Si/H] for the Sun, but perhaps the ratio of [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 can be used.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for Star_1, [Si/H]=0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H]=-0.3. Is that correct?

Let me double-check that.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *1e0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1 ) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun *1e0.3) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun )

= (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *1e0.3.

Which is nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *1e0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( nSi_1/nH_1 ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) = log10( (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *1e0.3 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log10(1e0.3) =0.3.

Yes, so [Si/H]_1=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2 ) = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 = nH_2 *1e-5.

So,

nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 → (nH_2 *1e-5 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

Rearranging,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 ].

= (nH_2 *1e-5 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *1e0.3 )

Now, what is nMg_sun /nSi_sun?

That's (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun )

= (1e-5) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun )

But [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) → nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^{ [Mg/Si]_sun }

But we don't know [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_sun as log10( (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ) ) → which is log10( (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun ) → which is [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (nMg/nH)_sun ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )

But (nMg/nH)_sun =1e-5, and (nSi/nH)_sun is X, which we don't know.

So,

[Mg/Si]_sun = log10(1e-5 ) - log10(X ) = (-5 ) - log10(X )

But without knowing [Mg/Si]_sun, this might not help.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Let's express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2 ) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) )=0.3.

We can write nMg_2 =nH_2 *1e-5.

So,

(nMg_2/nSi_2 ) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 → (nH_2 *1e-5 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

Solving for nSi_2,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *1e-5 * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun *1e0.3 )

But,

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun is something we don't know.

But maybe we can relate [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =nH_2 *1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3.

So,

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

But nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *1e-5 ) / ( (1e-5 *nH_sun / nSi_sun ) *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *1e-5 ) * nSi_sun / ( nH_sun *1e-5 *1e0.3 )

= (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun * 1e0.3 )

But,

(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_sun +12 } ? Wait, no:

Wait, [Si/H]_sun is log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) → zero. Because [X/H]_sun=0.

Wait, no. [X/H]_sun is zero by definition, because it's the solar abundance. So,

log10(nX_sun/nH_sun ) = 12 + log10(nX_sun/nH_sun ) -12 → no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the way the problem is given, for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, nMg/nH=1e-5.

But for Si, we don't have [Si/H]_sun, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute it based on the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun, which I don't know, but perhaps it's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I can get [Si/H]_2 from [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Wait, that seems promising. Let's see.

Because,

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → because [X/Y] = [X/Z] - [Y/Z].

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

So,

0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Yes, that makes sense.

So Star_1 has [Si/H]=0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H]=-0.3.

Thus, the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2 is (nSi_1/(nH_1)) / (nSi_2/(nH_2)) ) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

Which can be written as 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } / 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } } → because [Si/H] is the log10(nSi/nH) relative to the Sun.

Wait, because [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1 ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Similarly for [Si/H]_2.

So, 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

And 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } = (nSi_2/nH_2 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^{ [Si/H]_1 } * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ] / [10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ] 

= 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Which is,

10^{ 0.3 - (-0.3) } =10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98 ~4.0.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is close to option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but why is the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2 )? Because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Wait, wait, no. Because the ratio (nSi_1/(nH_1)) / (nSi_2/(nH_2)) ) is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1 *nH_2 )/(nH_1 *nSi_2 )

But the actual ratio of silicon atoms (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) would be (nSi_1/nH_1 )/(nSi_2/nH_2 ) multiplied by (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But wait, we don't know anything about the ratio of H in the two stars. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, we can't compute the ratio of Si atoms. Because the abundance ratios depend on the total number of atoms.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of H atoms is the same in both stars, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which would correspond to the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

But then, unless the H densities are same, which isn't given, this can't be determined.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the H is the same in both stars, which would make their photospheric H counts equal. But the question doesn't state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

= (nSi_1 *nH_2 )/(nH_1 *nSi_2 )

= (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But without knowing the ratio of H in the stars, we can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only concerned with the ratio of Si relative to H in each star, and not their absolute numbers. So, if [Si/H]_1=0.3, and [Si/H]_2=-0.3, the ratio of (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2 )=10^{0.6} ~3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, that would be (nSi_1)/(nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nSi_2 )

But unless nH_1 =nH_2, we can't proceed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star, so perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the ratio is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ), which gives 10^{0.6}=~3.98.

So the answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ) - log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)_sun.

### Step 1: Abundance Ratios for Star_1
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means the Fe-to-H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., nFe₁/nH₁ = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we have:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{Fe}}_1) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}) + 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \(n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot} \cdot (n_{\text{H}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_{\odot})\), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_1 = (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \cdot 10^{0.3}
  \]
  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_1 is:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3
  \]

### Step 2: Abundance Ratios for Star_2
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means the Mg-to-H ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., nMg₂/nH₂ = nMg_sun/nH_sun.
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we have:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}_2 / n_{\text{Si}}_2) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}) + 0.3
  \]
  Rearranging, we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}_2 = (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}
  \]
  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_2 is:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3
  \]

### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_1)}{(n_{\text{Si}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}_2)} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
Substituting \([\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3\) and \([\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3\), we get:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
