Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques and gene expression constructs. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors have two genes under the same promoter, but this one uses loxP sites and stop cassettes, so it's probably about mouse models and Cre-mediated recombination.

So the vector setup: Ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, and both have stop cassettes. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which I remember allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed as a separate transcript after the ligand.

Wait, the vector structure is probably like this: CBA promoter drives transcription of both ligand and receptor. The ligand is first, then a stop cassette with loxP, then the receptor with IRES, and then another stop cassette.

When the vector is used in mice, the Cre recombinase is introduced. Cre recognizes loxP sites. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes block expression. If Cre is present, it deletes the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

In this case, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's active in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal. They expected some green signal from eGFP, but didn't see any. So the question is why.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I don't think this affects expression in the Western blot or the fluorescence. Plus, the question is about not seeing the GFP, which is about expression, not function.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, so maybe not detected. But the Western blot uses total proteins, so if it's in the Golgi, wouldn't it still show up when you extract total proteins? Also, the question says the blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option C: the enhancer for expression is missing. Both ligand and receptor are under strong promoters (CBA and IRES), so maybe this isn't the case. But wait, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression levels are too low. Alternatively, maybe the expression is only in certain tissues.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. So in the homozygous mice, when Cre is present, the stops are removed, so the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. But why no green?

Wait, another thought: in the vector, the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, which is a fluorescent tag. So the ligand and mCherry would be under the CBA promoter. The receptor is at the 3' end, with IRES, so it's a separate ORF, and with eGFP. But perhaps the way the vector is set up, the eGFP is being expressed correctly or not.

Wait, but in the construct, the ligand is first. So the mRNA is CBA promoter -> ligand ORF with a stop (loxP), then IRES, then receptor ORF with stop (lox2272). So when Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), the loxP sites are recombined, and the stops are removed. So the ligand would be expressed, and the receptor would be expressed after the IRES.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector. The CBA promoter drives the transcription of both ligand and receptor. The ligand is in the first exon, followed by a stop cassette. The receptor is after the IRES, which allows it to be expressed as a separate protein. So, when Cre is active, both stops are removed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre line. So in the offspring, which are from the homozygous construct and SOX10-Cre, the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, leading to the expression of both ligand and receptor.

But in the Western blot, when they overexpressed the proteins and made antibodies, the blot showed signals proportional to actin. So the expression was successful in culture. But in the mouse, they see no green (eGFP). So why?

Wait, maybe the issue is in the construct's IRES. IRES allows for expression of the second gene without a second promoter. But sometimes, if the IRES is not functional, the second gene isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is wrong. The question says that the receptor ORF is at the 3' end and eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the receptor is fused to eGFP. But if the stop cassette has a frame shift, maybe the eGFP is not in frame, so it isn't expressed.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't being expressed as a separate entity. So when Cre deletes the lox2272 stop cassette, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF. But if the eGFP is not in frame, then the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the receptor is meant to be expressed as a fusion with eGFP. So if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then after Cre deletes the stop, the receptor is expressed along with eGFP as a fusion.

But wait, in the vector, the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the full construct would be Receptor-eGFP. So when Cre deletes the stop, the ORF from the receptor to eGFP is continuous, meaning they're in the same reading frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

So why would they not be in frame? Perhaps the vector was constructed incorrectly. For example, the stop cassette includes a stop codon with a frame that's different, but when the stop is removed, the reading frame shifts, making eGFP out of frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are involved. The ligand has a loxP-stop in front of mCherry, and the receptor has lox2272-stop after the receptor and before eGFP.

Wait, when Cre is introduced, the loxP and lox2272 are recognized. But lox2272 is a variant of loxP that Cre can also act upon. So in the ligand region, the loxP is between the ligand ORF and mCherry, so when Cre is present, it deletes the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, in the receptor region, the lox2272 is upstream of eGFP, so when Cre acts, it deletes the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a fusion.

But wait, the vector is designed to have the ligand ORF at 5', followed by a stop cassette (which includes loxP), then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then another stop with lox2272 before eGFP.

So, in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed as a fusion, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed as a fusion.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then the fusion isn't made correctly, so eGFP isn't expressed. So when the mouse is born, the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green signal.

In the Western blot, the overexpressed proteins gave a signal proportional to actin. So the expression worked in culture. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening? Or the GFP isn't being made.

Wait, but why in the mouse would it not express, but in the culture it did?

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the expression in the mouse. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct, but perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells that are being visualized. Or maybe Cre isn't active in the right cells.

Wait, the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and crossed to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in the neural crest, so the Cre would be active there. So in the offspring, which are from the homozygous construct and SOX10-Cre, Cre should be active in neural crest cells. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But in the microscopy, they don't see green. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP isn't expressed. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP, but if the frames don’t match, the eGFP isn’t made. So in the Western blot, perhaps the receptor is expressed but not the eGFP.

Wait, but the Western blot was in primary astrocyte culture. So when they transfected the plasmid, the ligand and receptor were correctly expressed, but in the mice, with the construct in their genome, maybe the expression is different. Or perhaps in the mice, the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is in the wrong place. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor is expressed as a separate message. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed.

But the Western blot showed expression when overexpressed, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the promoter isn't active in the cells where they're looking. But in the Western blot, it was expressed in astrocytes, which might not be the same as the cells in the mouse.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So in all cells, when Cre is present, the ligand and receptor should be expressed. But in the mouse, they're using SOX10-Cre, which only activates Cre in neural crest cells. So in other cells, the Cre isn't active, so the stops remain, and the ligand and receptor aren't expressed.

But the microscopy is probably looking in the neural crest-derived cells. So if the construct is expressed correctly, they should see eGFP in those cells.

Wait, but the question states that the offspring is born, and the visualization is done on them. If the eGFP is not expressed, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being made.

So, going back to the options, option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, then the eGFP won't be translated. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor's mRNA is read into eGFP, but if the ORF is disrupted, the eGFP isn't made, so no fluorescence.

In the Western blot, when the plasmid was transfected into astrocytes, perhaps the proteins were expressed correctly because the plasmid is in a certain configuration, but in the genomic context, the frames are different.

Wait, but the vector is designed such that when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor is in frame with eGFP. So perhaps during the cloning, the eGFP wasn't in frame, making the fusion not work. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So the correct answer would be D.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair under specific promoters and stop cassettes. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The vector includes loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes, which are removed by Cre recombinase to allow expression of the ligand and receptor. The experiment was performed in a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. Despite this, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option refers to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor but does not explain the absence of eGFP expression. The question focuses on why eGFP is not observed, which is unrelated to paracrine signaling. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be detectable in total protein extracts used for Western blotting. Since the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, this suggests that the construct is being expressed and not retained in the Golgi. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   Both the ligand and receptor are under strong promoters (CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor). The absence of an enhancer is unlikely to be the issue, especially since the construct worked in primary astrocyte culture. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The eGFP is fused to the receptor at the C-terminus. If the stop cassette is removed by Cre, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed as a single fusion protein. However, if the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame relative to the receptor, it would not be translated, resulting in no green signal. This is the most likely explanation for the absence of eGFP fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP fluorescence is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame, preventing the expression of eGFP. This aligns with the observation that the construct worked in vitro but not in vivo.
