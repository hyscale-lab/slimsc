Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Hmm, right. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Oh wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma_e is 4. Then there's a positron moving from the right, so opposite direction, with a Lorentz factor of 2. Gamma_p is 2.

After they collide, they annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same. Oh, interesting. And the directions— one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right but in opposite vertical directions. Wait, no, upper-right and lower-right implies they're moving towards the right but one up and one down. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis.

The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. So I need to find that angle based on their directions.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the system is the electron and positron, whatever comes out must have the same total energy and momentum.

Let me think about the initial momentum. The electron is moving to the right, positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's assign directions: let's say the horizontal axis is the x-axis. So the electron's velocity is along +x, positron is along -x.

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving from the right, so that would mean it's moving to the left, right? Because if the electron is moving from the left to the right (along +x), and the positron is moving from the right to the left (so also along -x). Wait, no, wait. The question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So it's moving to the left, because it's moving along the same axis but the opposite direction as the electron.

Wait no, the problem says "the positron is moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right". So perhaps the positron is moving towards the left, along the x-axis. So the electron is going to the right, and the positron is going to the left.

Hmm, but wait, the Lorentz factors are given. So I need to calculate the relativistic momentum and energy for each.

But wait, for a positron, isn't it like a positive electron? So its rest mass is same as electron, which is about 0.511 MeV/c². So same as electron, but opposite charge.

So for the electron: gamma_e =4, so its velocity is v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e²)) ) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) )= (sqrt(15)/4 ) c.

Similarly for positron: gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) c.

Wait wait, but wait. The positron is moving in the opposite direction. So the electron is moving in +x, positron in -x.

So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's calculate the momentum and energy of each.

Momentum p = gamma * m * v. But since for electrons and positrons, their rest mass m is the same.

Wait, but the electron's velocity is v_e = (sqrt(15)/4 ) c, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, another formula for momentum in terms of gamma. Momentum p = gamma * m * v. But v = beta c. So p = gamma * m * beta c.

Alternatively, since beta is v/c, and beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So for the electron, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4. Gamma_e is 4.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Wait, but m_e c is the rest energy, right? So m_e c^2 is the rest energy. So m_e c is (m_e c^2)/c = (0.511 MeV)/c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of units where c=1. Because in particle physics, they often use natural units where c=1. So let me assume c=1 for simplicity.

So gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/4)^2 ) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

So the electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 ) = m_e * sqrt(15).

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = m_e * sqrt(3).

But wait, the positron is moving opposite to the electron. So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but wait, since the positron is moving from the right, which direction is that? Let me clarify the directions.

Electron is moving from left to right, so along +x. Positron is moving from the right, which would imply it's moving to the left, along -x. So the positron's momentum is in the -x direction.

So p_initial is p_e (positive) and p_p in negative. So the total momentum is p_e - p_p.

Wait, but wait: the positron is moving from the right towards the left, so its momentum is to the left, so negative.

So p_initial = (p_e) - (p_p) ?

Wait, no. Let me think: the electron is moving to the right, so p_e is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from the right), so p_p is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).

Which is p_e - p_p.

Wait, no: the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So when we add them, it's p_e (positive) plus (-p_p), since p_p is the magnitude.

Wait, no: actually, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p, but since it's moving to the left, its momentum is -p_p.

So p_initial = p_e (electron) + (-p_p) (positron) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but earlier calculation of p_e and p_p in terms of m_e:

p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 ) = m_e * sqrt(15).

p_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = m_e * sqrt(3).

So p_initial = m_e * sqrt(15) - m_e * sqrt(3) = m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).

Wait, but m_e is the same for both. So let's just keep it as m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) in the initial momentum.

Now, the problem states that after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both photons have the same energy. So E_photon1 = E_photon2.

Photons have momentum p = E / c, since E = pc for photons. But since I'm using natural units where c=1, p_photon = E_photon.

Wait, but in the problem, since both photons have same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same. But their directions are different. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So each has a momentum vector in the x-y plane, but in opposite y-directions.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The two photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum. But their directions are symmetric about the x-axis. So for example, photon 1 has direction (x, y), photon 2 has (x, -y).

So their momentum vectors are (E, y) and (E, -y), since E is the magnitude and their directions are at angles theta and -theta from the x-axis, where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.

Wait, but photons can't have negative energy, but their momentum direction can be in any direction. So in this case, each photon's momentum will have a component in the x and y directions.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1: momentum vector (p_x1, p_y1) = (E cos theta, E sin theta )

Photon 2: momentum vector (p_x2, p_y2) = (E cos theta, -E sin theta )

Wait, but why would their x-components be the same? Because the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So yes, same x-component, opposite y-components.

So total momentum after annihilation is (p_x1 + p_x2, p_y1 + p_y2 ) = (2 E cos theta, 0 )

Because p_y1 + p_y2 = E sin theta - E sin theta = 0.

So the total momentum after is (2 E cos theta, 0 )

But initial momentum before collision was p_initial = m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

So to conserve momentum, the total momentum after must equal the total before.

Thus,

2 E cos theta = m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

But wait, what about energy conservation?

The initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is gamma * m_e c^2, but since we're using units where c=1, it's just gamma * m_e.

So energy of electron: E_e = gamma_e * m_e =4 m_e.

Energy of positron: E_p = gamma_p * m_e = 2 m_e.

Total initial energy: 4 m_e + 2 m_e =6 m_e.

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons. Since each photon's energy is E, total energy is 2 E.

So energy conservation:

2 E =6 m_e → E=3 m_e.

So now we have E=3 m_e. Plugging this into the momentum equation:

2 * 3 m_e * cos theta = m_e ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Simplify:

6 m_e cos theta = m_e (sqrt(15 ) - sqrt(3) )

Divide both sides by m_e:

6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

So cos theta = (sqrt(15 ) - sqrt(3) ) /6.

Compute the value:

sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos theta ≈ 0.35682 → theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute that. Arccos(0.3568): let me think, cos(60°)=0.5, cos(70°)≈0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 70 and 60 degrees. Let's compute:

60 degrees: 0.5

70: ~0.3420

So 0.3568 is between 70 and 60, but closer to 70.

Wait, wait, wait, alternatively using a calculator here, but in an exam setting, perhaps I should use exact expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it exactly.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the angle between the two photons. Each photon is at angle theta above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta.

Because one is at +theta and the other at -theta, so the angle between the two directions is 2 theta.

So if theta is approximately 69 degrees, then 2 theta would be about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So that's the answer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's recompute cos theta.

cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

Let me compute that exactly.

sqrt(15) = approx 3.872983, sqrt(3)=1.7320508.

So 3.872983 -1.7320508 = 2.140932.

Divide by 6: 2.140932 /6 ≈ 0.356822.

So cos theta is approximately 0.3568.

Now, what angle has cos theta = 0.3568?

Well, cos(60°)=0.5

cos(65°)= approx 0.4226

cos(70°)=0.3420

So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Let me interpolate.

At 69 degrees, cos is approx 0.3584.

At 70, 0.3420.

Wait, 0.3568 is between 0.3584 (69) and 0.3420 (70). Wait, 0.3568 is a bit less than 0.3584. So it's a bit less than 69 degrees.

Wait, 69 degrees: 0.3584.

69.5 degrees: cos is 0.3530.

Wait, so 0.3568 is a bit above 69 degrees.

Wait, perhaps 69.2 degrees.

But regardless, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, so approximately 2 * 69.2 = 138.4 degrees. Close to 138 degrees, which is option C.

So the angle between the photons is 2 theta, which is approximately 138 degrees.

Looking at the options:

A)74

B)172

C)138

D)96

So the correct answer would be option C)138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Electron**: Moving to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \).
2. **Positron**: Moving to the left with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_p = 2 \).
3. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy \( E \), one moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction.

### Conservation Laws:
- **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the collision must be equal.
- **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the collision must be equal.

#### Initial Momentum:
The electron and positron have opposite momenta. Using the relativistic momentum formula \( p = \gamma m v \), where \( v = \beta c \) and \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we calculate:
- For the electron:  
  \( \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} \),  
  \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e = 4 m_e \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e \sqrt{15} \).
- For the positron:  
  \( \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \),  
  \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p = 2 m_e \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e \sqrt{3} \).

Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

#### Final Momentum:
The two photons have equal energy \( E \) and move symmetrically about the x-axis. Let the angle each photon makes with the x-axis be \( \theta \). The momentum of each photon is \( p = E \), and their momentum vectors are:  
- Photon 1: \( (E \cos \theta, E \sin \theta) \),
- Photon 2: \( (E \cos \theta, -E \sin \theta) \).

The total final momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (2 E \cos \theta, 0).
\]

Equating initial and final momentum:  
\[
2 E \cos \theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

#### Energy Conservation:
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e + \gamma_p m_e = 4 m_e + 2 m_e = 6 m_e.
\]

The total energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of the two photons:  
\[
E_{\text{final}} = 2 E.
\]

Equating initial and final energy:  
\[
2 E = 6 m_e \implies E = 3 m_e.
\]

#### Solving for \( \theta \):
Substitute \( E = 3 m_e \) into the momentum equation:  
\[
2 (3 m_e) \cos \theta = m_e (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
\]
\[
6 \cos \theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]

Simplify:  
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

Using approximations \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.873 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):  
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
\]

The angle \( \theta \) is:  
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \):  
\[
2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**, which corresponds to option **C**.
