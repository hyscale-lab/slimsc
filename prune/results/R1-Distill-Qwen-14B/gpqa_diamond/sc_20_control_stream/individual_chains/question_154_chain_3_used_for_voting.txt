Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the chemist found a white solid, and we have some spectral data to figure out what it is. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D.

Let's look at the data step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and it's 100%, which usually means it's the molecular formula. There's also a peak at 158 with 32%, which is a fragment maybe? Hmm, wait, but 158 is 2 higher than 156. So, maybe that's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 35 and 37 Cl. So if the molecular ion is 156, and there's a peak at 158 (which is +2), that suggests the molecular formula includes a Cl atom. Because Cl has a mass of 35 and 37, so the molecular ion would have a Cl at 35 (so molecular ion is 156), and 37 would add 2, making 158. The ratio is 32%, which is about 35Cl to 37Cl. Wait, but the natural abundance is about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So the molecular ion peak is the M peak (156), and the M+2 is 32% of the M. Wait, wait, perhaps the molecular formula includes one Cl. Because molecular ion would usually be M. But why is the M+2 32%?

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula has one Cl. Let's think. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

So all options contain Cl. Let me check their molecular weights.

A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2.

Wait, benzaldehyde has C7H6O, but with Cl and another O? Let me calculate:

Benzaldehyde is C7H7O (no, wait, when it's benzaldehyde, it's C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O. Wait, but if it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. So the molecular weight would be:

C:7*12=84, H:5*1=5, Cl:35.5, O:32. So 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So approximately 156.5, which would round to m/z 156 as the molecular ion. That fits.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, so 4-chloro would add Cl. So formula C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 32. So again, 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So m/z 156.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's C6H5COCl. So formula is C8H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 8*12=96, 5*1=5, 35.5, 32. So 96+5=101, +35.5=136.5, +32=168.5. So m/z would be 168.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so option C is probably out because 168 is higher than 156.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Its formula is also C7H5ClO2. So same as B, molecular weight around 156.5, so m/z 156. So option D has same mass as B.

So the molecular ion matches B and D and A (since their molecular formulas are similar but varying substituents). So the mass data alone doesn't narrow it down.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, which is usually indicative of O-H stretching. But wait, 3500-2700 can include O-H and maybe some other stretches. Broad peaks in IR can be due to O-H in an acid (like carboxylic acid) or perhaps an alcohol. But wait, for carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is usually broad and around 2500-3300. If the peak is from 3500-2700, that's a bit lower. Also, another strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). What kinds of carbonyls are there? Carboxylic acid, ester, aldehyde, ketone, etc.

Looking at the options:

A is a benzaldehyde derivative with a hydroxyl and a Cl. So it has an aldehyde group (CHO) and a hydroxyl (OH) group. The IR would show a strong peak for the aldehyde C=O around 1720 cm^-1? Wait, aldehydes typically have C=O around 1720. Alternatively, carboxylic acids have C=O around 1700, but they also have O-H. Wait, but in option B and D, it's benzoic acid derivatives, so they have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). So their O-H would be broad and strong (like around 2500-3300), and the C=O would be around 1700 cm^-1. But in the given IR, the strong sharp peak is at 1720. Hmm, that's higher than typical for a carboxylic acid, which is more around 1680-1720, but maybe depends. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde would have higher wavenumbers. Let me think: aldehyde C=O is around 1720, ester about 1735-1750? Or maybe I got that wrong. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. I think aldehyde C=O is around 1720, ester a bit higher, like 1740. So if the IR has a peak at 1720, that could fit an aldehyde or maybe a ketone, but less likely. But wait, option A has an aldehyde group, so that could align with the 1720.

But then the IR also has a broad peak from 3500-2700. If the compound is a carboxylic acid (options B and D), the O-H would be broad, but perhaps in the lower end of that range, around 2500-3000? Or maybe if it's an alcohol, but in option A, it's a hydroxy benzaldehyde. So, it has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the 1H NMR data might help more. Let's look at that.

The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) - a singlet. High chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton (CHO) or an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps an aromatic OH.

Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but if it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol or carboxylic acid, it could be higher. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, this is a singlet, which is sharp. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak, but maybe in a solid or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9-10, but 11 is a bit high for that. Hmm.

Then we have 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So two doublets, each integrating to two protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because if it's para-substituted, the two protons on each adjacent carbon would be equivalent and show up as two doublets with the same coupling. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets: the protons ortho to the substituent. Wait, no, if the substituent is in the para position, then the two ortho protons would be a pair, and the two meta would be another, but maybe in this case, perhaps it's a di-substituted ring.

Wait, let me think about the structure. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but that's perhaps more complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but no, the two doublets suggest symmetry.

Wait, in the case of para-substituted benzaldehyde, if the substituents are in the para position, you might have two doublets for the ortho protons. Let me think of benzaldehyde: the aldehyde is in the para position relative to another substituent. For example, in 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, the aldehyde is in position 1, and the Cl is in position 4 (if it's benzaldehyde with Cl in para), then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the NMR. So, for a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, like Cl and another group, the protons would split into two sets of doublets. Each set has two protons. So in 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1, Cl at 4. Then the ring would have protons at 2 and 6, and 3 and 5. The protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and so would 3 and 5. So in the NMR, you'd see two doublets. Let me think, in o-dichlorobenzene, the protons are as two doublets. So in this case, the NMR data matches a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents causing the protons to split into two doublets.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So that's tri-substituted. The aromatic protons would not be symmetric, so perhaps more complex than two doublets. So the NMR would show more than two signals. So I don't think this matches the given NMR data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. So the ring is di-substituted in para positions. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. They would be equivalent as two pairs. So the NMR would show two doublets. So this fits the data.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are Cl at 2 and COOH at 1. So this is an ortho di-substitution. In ortho substitution, the ring protons would be more deshielded, and there might be more splitting. The NMR for a para substitution is more symmetric, giving two doublets. But in ortho, perhaps the coupling is more complex. Wait, but in the case of ortho substitution, the two substituents are adjacent, so perhaps the ring protons are in a more complex environment, maybe resulting in more than two signals. So perhaps the NMR wouldn't fit a para substitution as well.

So let's think about the NMR.

In option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have two substituents in para. The aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 equivalent. Each set would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. So the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) would fit.

The 11.0 ppm singlet: in benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Wait, but the COOH proton is usually a broad peak because it's exchanging with water, etc. But in the question, the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because for COOH, the proton is usually broad, not a sharp singlet. Unless the sample is very dry or something. Alternatively, maybe it's not the COOH group. Let me look at the other options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So it has a CHO group and a OH group on the ring. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but if there's an adjacent electrondonating group, it might shift higher. The OH proton might be around 5 ppm, but wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 11 ppm. Hmm, but phenolic OH protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless in a strong acid or something. But if it's an aldehyde proton, it's more like 9-10, but 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps the OH is deprotonated, but that's more in basic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm peak is from an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the aldehyde is in the structure. Looking back at the options, option A and C have an aldehyde or chloroformate group.

Wait, option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is OCl-CO-Ph. The structure would be O=C(OCl)Ph. So in that case, the chloroformate group has an OCl and a COO group attached to the benzene. The chloroformate group (like ClCO-O-) is an ester-like group. But would that have an aldehyde proton? No. So the 11 ppm peak wouldn't be from that.

So the 11 ppm peak would probably be either the aldehyde proton in option A or the COOH proton in options B and D.

Hmm. Benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. That's a bit conflicting. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that would fit better with option A.

Wait, let's think again. The 1H NMR has 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

If it's the COOH proton, it's a singlet. But usually, COOH protons are broad. Maybe in a solid or in a certain solvent, the peak could be sharp? Or perhaps it's not the COOH proton.

Alternatively, the 11.0 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. In that case, it's a singlet, which is typical. So that would fit option A.

But wait, if the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative, like option A, which is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the aromatic ring has substituents at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring would have protons at positions 4,5,6.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me draw the structure.

Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. So the benzene ring has a CHO group at position 1. In option A, there's also a Cl at position 3 and an OH at position 2. So substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring has a substituent at each of positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ring's remaining positions are 4,5,6.

Wait, but 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have substituents in positions 2,3, and 1. So the ring would have substituents at 1,2,3. That would make the ring have three substituents in a row. So the remaining positions (4,5,6) would each have a proton? Or would they be equivalent?

Wait, no, because substituents are in 1, 2, 3, so the ring would have positions 4,5,6. But in such a substitution pattern, the protons at positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent, and position 5 would be a singlet. Or perhaps more complex.

But the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests that each pair of equivalent protons is split into a doublet. So if the ring has two sets of two equivalent protons, each as a doublet, that's what is seen.

In the case of option A, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ring would have protons in positions 4,5,6. Position 4 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents? Let me think. If the substituents are in positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), then the ring protons would be at 4,5,6.

Wait, in such a substitution, the protons at 4 and 6 would both be adjacent to the substituent at position 3 (Cl) and the substituent at position 1 (CHO), respectively. Hmm, maybe the protons at 4 and 6 would be deshielded and perhaps show up as a doublet each. But I'm not sure if they would be equivalent. Alternatively, maybe the protons at 5 would be a singlet, but the NMR doesn't show that. So perhaps the NMR for option A would have more peaks than two, making it less likely to match the data.

So, going back, the NMR data fits a para-substituted ring, which is what options B and D have. So perhaps the correct structure is either B or D.

In option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6. These would be split into two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that matches the NMR.

In option D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid: substituents at position 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). This is an ortho substitution. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at position 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH, and positions 4 and 6 would be meta. I'm not sure about the splitting here. In an ortho substitution, the coupling constants might be larger, leading to more complex splitting. But perhaps it could result in two doublets. But usually, in ortho substitution, the NMR would have more splitting than that, maybe triplets or more complex patterns. So perhaps the para substitution (option B) is a better fit.

So, putting it all together:

Mass: 156, which is the molecular ion.

IR: broad peak 3500-2700 (maybe O-H from carboxylic acid), and strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl, perhaps from COOH or ester or aldehyde). But if it's a carboxylic acid, the C=O is around 1700, but 1720 is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the IR's 1720 is from an ester or an aldehyde. But in option B, the COOH group would have a C=O around 1700. So the 1720 might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the 1720 is from the O-H bending in the carboxylic acid? No, that's usually around 600-700 cm^-1. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the strong peak at 1720 could be a carbonyl from an ester. But none of the options are esters except perhaps option C. Oh wait, option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester-like structure. Its molecular weight is higher, so it's out. So maybe the 1720 is from an aldehyde.

But then, looking back, option B's IR would have the C=O at about 1700, which is lower than 1720. Hmm. So perhaps the correct structure is option B, but the IR doesn't fit perfectly. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the IR.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually from 2500-3300, so 3500-2700 might include it. But a broad peak in this region could also be from an alcohol. For example, in option A, there's a hydroxyl group (phenolic OH), which would have a broad peak in that region.

The IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720. Aldehyde's C=O is around 1720, which fits. So if option A is correct, the IR would show a strong peak for the aldehyde and a broad peak for the OH.

But wait, in option A, the compound is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So it has both an aldehyde and a phenolic OH group. The aldehyde C=O would be around 1720, and the OH would be broad around 3200-3500. So the IR would have both peaks. That fits.

But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the aldehyde proton. But in option A, the OH would be a proton in the aromatic ring, perhaps around 5 ppm. But the NMR doesn't show a peak around 5 ppm. Hmm, so that's a problem. Because the NMR shows 11.0 (s), 8.02 (d), and 7.72 (d). So where is the OH proton?

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is deprotonated, but in the solid state, maybe it's not visible. Or perhaps the OH is exchanging and not appearing as a peak. Or maybe the sample was taken in a way that the OH is not showing up. Alternatively, the integration might be tricky. But the NMR only shows three signals: 1H, 2H, 2H. So if the structure is option A, which has three substituents, the NMR would have more peaks. So perhaps that's not matching.

So perhaps the correct structure is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Let me think again about the NMR for option B: COOH proton is a singlet at 11.0 ppm. But typically, COOH protons are broad, not sharp. Maybe in this case, it's a sharp singlet because it's in a specific environment, or perhaps it's not the COOH proton. Alternatively, maybe the 11.0 ppm is from an aldehyde, but then the IR would have a C=O at 1720, which fits the aldehyde.

Wait, but option B is a carboxylic acid, so the C=O would be around 1700, not 1720. So the IR data is conflicting.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the peak at 1720 is from an ester or something else. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure would be Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be split differently. For example, the protons adjacent to the substituents might be more deshielded.

Wait, but the NMR in the question shows two doublets. So let's think about the substitution pattern.

In para substitution (option B), the two doublets each have 2H, which matches the NMR. In ortho substitution (option D), perhaps the splitting would be more complex. So perhaps the NMR data supports option B better.

But the IR's C=O peak is at 1720, which is higher than the typical 1700 for COOH. So that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the 1720 peak is from an ester. Let's look at option C: phenyl chloroformate. Its structure is OCl-CO-Ph. So the carbonyl would be part of the ester group, so its C=O would be around 1735-1750 cm^-1. But the molecular weight is higher, so the mass is 168, which doesn't match the given m/z 156. So option C is out.

So perhaps the correct structure is option B, despite the IR discrepancy.

Another angle: the mass has M+2 at 32%. So that's a Cl isotope. So molecular formula includes Cl. So from the options, B, D, and A include Cl.

Wait, let me calculate the exact mass for each:

For option B: molecular formula C7H5ClO2.

Molar mass: 7*12 =84, 5*1=5, Cl=35, O=16*2=32. Total:84 +5=89 +35=124 +32=156.

So M is 156. The M+2 would be 158, which corresponds to the Cl-37 isotope. The ratio is 32%, which is about 35Cl to 37Cl. Since natural Cl is about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl, the ratio of M to M+2 would be 75:25 → 3:1. But the given ratio is 100% for M, 32% for M+2. So wait, maybe the molecular ion is 100%, and the M+2 is 32%, but that's about 35Cl:37Cl. Wait, the molecular ion is M (35Cl) at 100%, and M+2 (37Cl) would be 25% of M. But the question says the M+2 is 32%, which is a bit higher than 25%. Hmm, but maybe it's not exact, or perhaps the structure has more than one Cl, but the options don't suggest that.

Wait, all options have only one Cl. So the M+2 should be about 25% of the M peak. But the question says M+2 is 32%, which is a bit higher. Hmmm. Maybe the data is approximate, so perhaps it's acceptable.

So, putting all together, I think the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR again. The 11 ppm peak is a singlet, which would be the COOH proton. If it's a singlet and sharp, that's a bit unusual for a COOH proton, which is usually broad. But maybe in this case, it's a sharp peak. Alternatively, perhaps the sample was treated in a way that deshields the proton, making it appear at a higher ppm.

Alternatively, if the 11 ppm peak is not the COOH proton, but an aldehyde proton, then option A would be correct, but then the NMR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, another possibility: the 11 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. So that would suggest option A. But then the NMR would have more peaks, which doesn't match.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, despite the IR C=O peak being a bit higher than expected. Alternatively, maybe the IR peak is correct for a carboxylic acid, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which could be the O-H from the carboxylic acid. Then the 1720 peak might be an error, or perhaps the C=O is a bit higher than usual. Alternatively, maybe the C=O is from an ester, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

But in that case, the NMR would show a different splitting pattern. Wait, in option D, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring would have protons at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH. Would they split into two doublets? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they would be more split.

Wait, perhaps the structure is option B, which has a para substitution, and the NMR data matches.

So, I'm going to go with option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis of the given information and the options:

### Mass Spectral Data:
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound.
- **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: This suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as chlorine has two naturally occurring isotopes, ^35Cl (75%) and ^37Cl (25%). The ratio of M to M+2 aligns with the expected isotopic pattern for a single chlorine atom.

### IR Data:
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1**: This indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenolic group.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The wavenumber of 1720 cm^-1 is consistent with a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

### 1H NMR Data:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: This is a sharp singlet, likely corresponding to an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2  
   - Matches the molecular weight (156) and the presence of chlorine.  
   - The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets due to the asymmetry caused by substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl).  
   - The NMR data does not match, as the splitting pattern is inconsistent with the given signals.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2  
   - Matches the molecular weight (156) and the presence of chlorine.  
   - The para-substitution pattern (Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1) results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, producing two doublets in the NMR, consistent with the data.  
   - The IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 could be slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid C=O (1700 cm^-1), but this is within reasonable experimental variation.  
   - The 11.0 ppm singlet could correspond to the COOH proton, though carboxylic acid protons are typically broad.  
   - **Matches the data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Molecular formula: C8H5ClO2  
   - Molecular weight: 168.5, which does not match the molecular ion peak at m/z = 156.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2  
   - Matches the molecular weight (156) and the presence of chlorine.  
   - The ortho-substitution pattern (Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1) would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, inconsistent with the two doublets observed.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR, and NMR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern explains the NMR splitting, and the IR data aligns reasonably with the functional groups present.

**Answer: B**
