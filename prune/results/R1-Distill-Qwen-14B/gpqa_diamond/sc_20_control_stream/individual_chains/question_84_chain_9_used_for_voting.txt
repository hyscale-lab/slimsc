Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question mentions using higher-order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. The main point is about the key factor in this conversion. The options are A to D, each related to some aspect of the method.

So, I remember that when dealing with matrix exponential functions, especially in the context of parallel algorithms, there's something about approximating the exponential. Matrix exponentials are often involved in solving systems of linear differential equations, which is relevant here since heat equations are PDEs that can be transformed into systems using finite differences.

Parallel splitting methods, like the ones used in these algorithms, usually involve decomposing the problem into smaller parts that can be solved concurrently. I think this relates to the structure of the matrix involved. If the matrix can be split into submatrices that don't interfere much with each other (like being diagonal or having a certain structure), it becomes easier to parallelize.

Looking at the options, let's see each one:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't produce growing errors. Important, but I'm not sure it's the key for converting to parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate things, but I'm not sure how that directly ties into parallelism.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximation methods, like those using Padé approximants, might have issues with complex roots. Wait, if the approximation has complex roots, that might affect the stability or the structure of the matrix. But how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe it's about the invertibility or the ability to split the matrix.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to decompose a rational function into simpler terms. If the approximation can be broken down into parts that can be handled separately, that would help in parallel processing. So, a linear partial fraction decomposition might allow each part to be computed independently, making parallelism feasible.

Wait, so the key is about how the approximation can be split. Fractional approximation methods, like those using Padé approximants or other rational functions, when decomposed into partial fractions, can be evaluated in parallel because each term can be computed separately. This decomposition is often called a partial fraction expansion.

So, the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation allows each part to be solved concurrently. That would make the algorithm parallel. Thus, option D seems right because the ability to split the approximation into independent terms is what enables parallel processing.

Stability analysis (A) is crucial for the method's correctness but isn't the key factor for converting to parallel. Nonlocal boundary conditions (B) might complicate the setup but not the parallelism itself. Complex roots (C) could affect the approximation's validity, but how does that directly relate to making the algorithm parallel? Maybe if there are complex roots, certain methods aren't applicable, but the key for parallelism is the decomposition.

So, I think the answer is D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation.

The question focuses on the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when solving higher-dimensional heat equations using higher-order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. The analysis of the options reveals that:

- **Stability analysis (A)** is important for ensuring the numerical method's reliability but does not directly enable parallelism.  
- **Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (B)** may complicate the problem setup but is not the primary factor for parallelization.  
- **Complex roots of fractional approximation (C)** could affect the approximation's validity but do not directly facilitate parallel processing.  
- **Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation (D)** is the critical factor. By decomposing the approximation into simpler, independent terms, it allows for concurrent computation, making parallelism feasible.

Thus, the ability to decompose the fractional approximation using linear partial fractions is the key factor for enabling parallel processing.
