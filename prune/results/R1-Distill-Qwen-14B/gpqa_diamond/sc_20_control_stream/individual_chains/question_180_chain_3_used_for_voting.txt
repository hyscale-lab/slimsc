Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. I remember that e is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C, but maybe I'll just keep it as 2e for now to make calculations easier.

Now, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. Oh wait, so the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Wait, wait, no. The way it's worded: 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed there, and the others are all at 2 meters from P.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I think the key here is electric potential energy. Because in an isolated system, the energy is related to the potential energy between the charges.

Wait, but what's the formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges? Oh right, the formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, in this case, since there are multiple charges, I have to consider all the pairwise interactions. So for each pair of charges, I need to calculate the potential energy and then sum them all up.

But wait, the system is composed of 13 charges. Let me think: the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are at 2 m from P. So each of the other 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th charge at P. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't say anything about their relative positions to each other, but perhaps we can assume that they are far apart compared to 2m, or maybe they're all at the same point. Wait, but in reality, identical charges would repel each other, but the problem says 'constrained' so maybe their positions are fixed, meaning they don't move relative to each other. Oh wait, but that's not possible without more information. So perhaps for the purpose of calculating the potential energy, the only interactions we need to consider are between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Wait, but that can't be right because the 12 charges would also exert forces on each other, but since they're constrained, maybe their positions are fixed, meaning their mutual distances are fixed as well. But the problem doesn't give any information about their mutual distances, so maybe I'm to ignore them because they're considered to be at the same point? Or perhaps the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2m from P but are arranged in some way, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I'm supposed to consider only their interactions with the charge at P.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh, wait a minute—electric potential energy is a state function, so the total potential energy depends on all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem. The 12 charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 12 are each 2m away from the 13th. But what about their mutual distances? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps they're all at the same point, but that can't be because identical charges would repel. Alternatively, maybe they're arranged in a way where the mutual distances are much larger than 2m, but without that information, perhaps I'm to assume that their mutual distances are irrelevant, or that their mutual potential energy is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not the potential energy between the 12 themselves.

Wait, but that's probably not correct because in reality, the 12 charges would exert forces on each other, so their mutual potential energies would contribute to the total. But without knowing their distances from each other, I can't calculate that. So maybe the problem is simplified, and I'm supposed to ignore the mutual interactions among the 12 charges. Or perhaps the problem considers that the 12 charges are all at the same location as each other, but that would be another scenario.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not given. So, maybe the problem expects us to only compute the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not the potential energy between the 12. Because otherwise, without more information, we can't proceed. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

So, if that's the case, the total potential energy U would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge.

Wait, but each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, so each is 2m from the 13th charge. So for each of the 12, the potential energy between that charge and the 13th is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, no: wait, the charge at P is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e as well. So each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/2 = 2k e².

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 * 2k e² = 24k e².

But wait, wait a second—no, that's not correct. Because the potential energy between two charges is a mutual thing, but each pair is only counted once. Or wait, no, in this case, each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th. So each of the 12 has a unique pair with the 13th. So the total would be 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m)).

So that's 12 * [k*(4e²)/2] = 12*(2k e²) = 24k e².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's all. Because in the system, the 12 charges might also interact with each other. But without knowing their relative positions, how can I calculate that?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't say anything about their distances from each other. So perhaps the mutual potential energy among the 12 is to be ignored. That's probably the case, as otherwise, we can't proceed without more information.

So, proceeding under that assumption, the total potential energy U is the sum of all the interactions between the 12 and the 13th. So 12 terms, each being U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2).

Wait, but wait: each pair is between the 13th and the 12 others, so each has charge 2e, so each U_i is k*(2e)*(2e)/(r), where r is 2m. So each U_i is k*(4e²)/(2) = 2k e². So 12 of those gives 12 * 2k e² = 24k e².

But wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So when you have N charges, the total is the sum over all i < j of U_ij. But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 is at 2m from it. So each of the 12 has a unique pair with the 13th, but no other pairs are considered (since the mutual distances of the 12 are not given). So perhaps that's the approach.

Wait, but in that case, the total U would be 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m))).

Let me compute that.

So, compute U = 12 * [k * (2e)^2 / (2m)].

Wait, 2e is each charge, so (2e)^2 is 4e². So each term is [k *4e²/(2m)].

So that's [4k e²/(2m)] = 2k e²/m.

Multiply by 12: 24k e²/m.

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers.

k is approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

m is 2 meters.

So:

U = 12 * [ (8.988e9) * ( (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 ) ] / (2)

Wait, wait, 2e is each charge, so 2e = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So each charge is 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = approx 1.026e-37 C².

So each term: (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / (2).

Wait, because each U_i is (k * q1 q2 ) / r. So for each pair, q1 and q2 are both 2e, and r is 2m.

So each U_i is [8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ] / 2.

Let me compute that.

First, calculate 3.204e-19 squared: 3.204^2 = about 10.265, so 10.265e-38 = 1.0265e-37.

So 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = let's compute 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = 8.988 * 1.0265 = approximately 9.228 (since 8.988 *1 =8.988, 8.988*0.0265≈0.238, so total around 9.226). So 9.226e-28.

Then divide by 2: 9.226e-28 / 2 = 4.613e-28.

Each U_i is 4.613e-28 J.

Now, 12 such pairs: 12 * 4.613e-28 = 55.356e-28 = 5.5356e-27 J.

Wait, but wait a moment: is this the total potential energy?

Wait, but each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the 13th. So yes, 12 pairs.

But wait, another point. The potential energy in a system of multiple charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So yes, each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the 13th.

So the total U is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which gives approximately 5.5356e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute (2e) * (2e) = 4e². So each term is k*(4e²)/(2m).

Which is 2k e²/m.

Then, 12 of them: U = 12 * 2k e²/m = 24k e²/m.

So let's compute this.

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 m.

So: 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, let me compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.026. So 23.026e-29 = 2.3026e-28.

Then multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3026e-28 = 55.262e-28 = 5.5262e-27 J.

Wait, that's the same as my earlier calculation, 5.53e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, but that's higher. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy between two charges is mutual, but in our case, each of the 12 charges interacts only with the 13th, and the 13th is fixed. So the 13th is a single charge, so each of the 12 pairs is unique. So 12 pairs. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs. So in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 others each are a pair with it. So 12 terms, each being (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m).

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So each is 2m from the 13th charge. So yes, each contributes a potential energy of k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So 12 of them, so U = 12 * (k*(4e^2)/(2m)) )= 12 * (2 k e²/m) )= 24 k e² / m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 24 * k * e² / m.

Compute k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m=2 m.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 / 2.

Wait, let's compute 24/2 =12.

So 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's see: 8 * 2.566 is about 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.536. So total around 23.064. So 23.064e-29 = 2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.3064e-28 *12 ≈ 27.677e-28 = 2.7677e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.768e-27 J, which is close to option B: 2.822e-26 J. Wait, no, option B is 2.822e-26, which is an order of magnitude larger.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me recompute the steps.

Let me compute each part again.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So (2e) = 3.204e-19 C.

Each U_i is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r. So (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2: (3.204)^2 = about 10.265, so 10.265e-38.

So (8.988e9) * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 *10.265 = approx 92.17, so 92.17e-29 = 9.217e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.217e-28 / 2 = 4.6085e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.6085e-28 * 12 = 55.302e-28 = 5.5302e-27 J.

Hmm, that's 5.53e-27 J, which isn't matching any of the options. The closest option is C) 7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed some factor. Let me check the initial setup.

Ah! Wait a second. The charges are 2e each. So (2e) squared is 4e², yes. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are all at 2m, but in 3D space. Do I need to consider the distances between them? No, because the problem states that their positions are fixed, so their mutual potential energies are fixed but not given. So perhaps the problem expects me to only consider the potential energy between the 12 and the 13th charge, and not the other terms. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's recalculate the exact value.

Let me compute each term accurately.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each charge = 2e = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

r = 2 m.

Each U_i = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2:

3.204e-19 * 3.204e-19 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.265716 * 1e-38 = 1.0265716e-37 C².

So U_i = 8.988e9 * 1.0265716e-37 / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 1.0265716e-37:

8.988e9 * 1.0265716e-37 = 8.988 * 1.0265716 * 1e9-37 = (8.988 * 1.0265716) * 1e-28.

8.988 * 1.0265716 ≈ let me compute that.

8 *1.0265716 = 8.2125728.

0.988 *1.0265716 ≈ 1.014.

So total around 8.2125728 + 1.014 ≈ 9.22657.

So 9.22657e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613285e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.613285e-28 * 12 = 55.35942e-28 = 5.535942e-27 J.

So approximately 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 5.536e-27. The closest is option C)7.056e-27, but that's about 27% higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I forgot to multiply by 12 correctly.

Wait, 4.613285e-28 J per pair, multiplied by 12 gives:

4.613285e-28 * 12 = (4.613285 *12) e-28.

4.613285 * 12 = 55.35942.

So 55.35942e-28 = 5.535942e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the potential energy is the sum of all pairs, including the 13th charge. But in that case, the 13th charge is fixed and doesn't move, so perhaps its potential energy isn't counted as part of the system's energy. Wait, no, the potential energy is a property of the system as a whole. So when you have multiple charges, each pair contributes. But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so the 12 charges are moving with respect to it. But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps the potential energy is only the sum of the interactions between the 12 and the 13th. So that part I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically around P, but at the same distance 2m. So their mutual distances may not be 2m, but perhaps arranged in a sphere or something. But without knowing their arrangement, I can't calculate their mutual potential energies. So the problem probably expects me to ignore the mutual interactions among the 12 and only compute the interactions with the 13th charge.

Given that, my calculation of 5.536e-27 J isn't matching any of the options. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of pairs. Let me think again: 13 charges. The 13th is fixed. The other 12 are each interacting with the 13th. So each of the 12 contributes a single pair. So 12 pairs, each contributing U_i.

But another possibility: perhaps the problem is to compute the potential energy between all the 12 charges and the 13th, but considering each 2e charge. Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of elementary charges.

Wait, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r.

In our case, each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and the 13th has 2e. So each pair contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So for 12 pairs, it's 12 * 2 e² k / m = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this as 24 * (e² * k ) / m.

Let me compute that accurately.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² * k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = (2.566 * 8.988) * 1e-29.

2.566 *8.988 ≈ 23.03.

So e² *k = 23.03e-29 = 2.303e-28.

Divide by m=2: 2.303e-28 /2 = 1.1515e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 1.1515e-28 = 27.636e-28 = 2.7636e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.76e-27 J. The options don't have that either.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem isn't considering the 13th charge as part of the potential energy? No, that doesn't make sense because the 13th is fixed, but the others are moving, so their potential energy is due to their positions relative to it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the work done to bring the charges into place, which is the same as the potential energy.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the 12 charges are all being brought to a point 2m from P, which is the position of the 13th charge. So each of the 12 is brought from infinity to 2m away, so the potential energy for each is the work done to bring it there, considering the electric field created by the 13th charge and the other 11.

Wait, that complicates things a lot because each charge's potential energy would depend on the presence of the others. That would make the problem much more involved, and without knowing the exact order of bringing them in, it's hard to compute. But perhaps the problem simplifies it, assuming that the other 11 have negligible effect or are placed symmetrically.

But that's probably beyond the scope of the question, which likely expects a simpler approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th, and not the mutual potential energies between the 12. So that's the same as what I did earlier, leading to 5.536e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at 2m from P, but all at the same point. That would mean that each of them is at the same location, so the distance between any two is zero. But that's impossible because like charges would repel, but if they're constrained, perhaps they're all at the same point. But in that case, the potential energy between each pair would be infinite, which isn't possible. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that all 13 charges are at positions 2m from P. But that can't be because the 13th is fixed at P. So no, the 13th is at P, and the others are at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Each charge is 2e, distance is 2m.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So for 12 pairs: 12 * 2 e² k/m = 24 e² k/m.

So let me compute this again accurately.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

m=2 m.

So 24 * e² * k / m = 24 * (2.566e-38) * (8.988e9) / 2.

Let me compute step by step.

24 / 2 = 12.

So 12 * 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9.

Compute 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988 = approx 23.03, multiplied by 1e-29 (since 1e-38 *1e9 =1e-29).

So 23.03e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.03 *12 = 276.36, so 276.36e-29 = 2.7636e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.76e-27 J.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the charges are protons or electrons, but since the problem states they're particles with charge 2e, perhaps they're electrons with double the charge, but that doesn't change the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using e = 1.6e-19 C for approximation.

Let me try that.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

Then, e² = 2.56e-38 C².

k = 9e9 N·m²/C² (approximated).

So each U_i = 9e9 * (2e)^2 /2m.

Wait, (2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.6e-19)^2 =4*2.56e-38=1.024e-37 C².

So U_i = (9e9) * (1.024e-37) / (2*2).

Wait, no, wait, each pair is at 2m. So r=2m.

So U_i = (9e9) * (4e²) / 2m.

Wait, 4e² is (2e)^2.

So U_i = (9e9) * (4*(1.6e-19)^2) / (2*2).

Compute denominator: 2m =4m? No, denominator is 2 meters.

Wait, no: U_i = (k * (2e)^2) / r.

So (9e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

e =1.6e-19 C.

(2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.6e-19)^2 =4*(2.56e-38) =1.024e-37 C².

r=2m.

So U_i = (9e9) * (1.024e-37) / 2.

Compute numerator: 9e9 *1.024e-37 =9 *1.024=9.216 → 9.216e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.608e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.608e-28 *12 =55.296e-28 =5.5296e-27 J.

Again, 5.53e-27 J.

No option matches this.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all 13 charges are at 2m from P, but that's not possible because the 13th is at P.

Wait, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way where each is 2m from P, and also at some distance from each other, but I don't have that information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, but I'm forgetting that the 13th charge has a charge of 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e.

Wait, no, that's what I already included.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let's see what that would require.

If 5.53e-27 is my calculation, but option C is 7.056e-27, what would cause a 27% increase?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to square the 2e. Let me check: (2e)^2 is 4e², correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is 2e, but the calculation is using e as 2e, which would be incorrect.

Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me double-check the exponents in each step.

e =1.6e-19 C.

e squared is (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38 C².

Multiply by k=9e9: 2.56e-38 *9e9 =23.04e-29 =2.304e-28.

Multiply by (2e)^2 / r: 4e² =4*(e²)=4*2.56e-38=1.024e-37.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: let's compute everything in terms of e.

The potential energy between two charges is U = k*q1*q2/r.

Here, q1=2e, q2=2e, r=2m.

So U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So for 12 pairs, U_total =12 * 2 e² k/m =24 e² k/m.

So now, let's plug in the numbers.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

m=2 m.

So:

U =24 * ( (1.602e-19)^2 ) * (8.988e9) / 2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =23.026e-29 =2.3026e-28.

Multiply by 24:24 * 2.3026e-28=55.2624e-28=5.52624e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 13th charge contributes to the potential energy of the system, but since it's fixed, its potential energy isn't counted. No, that doesn't make sense because the potential energy is a property of the entire system.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs, including among the 12 charges. But without their mutual distances, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the 12 charges are all at the same point, leading to infinite potential energy. But that's not possible, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P, but also that the 12 charges are at 2m from each other. But that would require a specific arrangement, perhaps on a sphere. But without knowing the exact positions, it's impossible to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at 2m from P and equally spaced around it, but again, without knowing their exact distances from each other, I can't compute their mutual potential energy.

Given all that, I think the intended approach is to only consider the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, leading to U =5.53e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge, but the 12 charges are all at the same point, leading to their mutual distance being zero. But that would make their mutual potential energy infinite, which isn't possible. So perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C, 7.056e-27 J. Let me see what that would imply.

7.056e-27 J.

Assuming U =24k e² /m =7.056e-27.

So 24k e² /m =7.056e-27.

Let me compute 24k e² = m * U.

m=2, U=7.056e-27.

So 24k e² =2 *7.056e-27 =1.4112e-26.

Compute 24 *k * e² =1.4112e-26.

k=8.988e9.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = ?

24 *8.988e9 =24*8.988=215.712 → 215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 = (215.712 *2.566) *1e-29.

215.712 *2.566 ≈ 553.5 → 553.5e-29 =5.535e-27.

Which is what I got earlier, so that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of 24k e²/m again.

Wait,

24k e²/m =7.056e-27.

So,

24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2 =7.056e-27.

Compute 1.602e-19 squared: 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9=2.303e-28.

Multiply by24:24 *2.303e-28=55.272e-28=5.5272e-27.

Divide by 2 (since m=2):5.5272e-27 /2=2.7636e-27.

Wait, that's not matching the desired 7.056e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.7636e-27 *2.555=7.056e-27.

Wait, 2.7636e-27 * 2.555 ≈ 7.056e-27.

But where would that factor come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is 2m from the 13th, but also, the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2m from each other. But that's not possible unless they're on a regular dodecagon or something, but without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula for potential energy in terms of coulombs and meters, but I'm using the wrong value for k.

Wait, Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9, which I've been using. So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in terms of electron volts, but the options are in joules. No, the question specifies joules.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at 2m from P, but the 13th is also moving, but no, it's fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e², which is correct.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including the 13th charge. But in that case, the 13th charge is fixed and doesn't move, so the potential energy would include the interactions between the 12 and the 13th, but not including the 13th's own potential energy.

Wait, but that doesn't change the calculation; it's still the 12 pairs.

I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, but the 12 are all at the same point, so their mutual distance is zero. But that would make their mutual potential energy infinite, which isn't possible, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but I'm including the 13th charge's potential energy as well. No, that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the potential energy as if the 12 charges are all at the same point as the 13th, but that would be a distance of zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't possible.

Given all this, I think the correct answer based on my calculation is approximately 5.53e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I don't see any error in my calculation. Perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

Wait, looking again: 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 are constrained at 2m from P, the 13th is at P.

Potential energy U = sum of U_ij for all pairs.

Only the pairs between the 13th and the 12 others contribute. So 12 pairs.

Each U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] =24k e² /m.

Yes.

So using exact values:

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

e=1.602e-19 C,

m=2 m.

So,

U=24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =2.303e-28.

Multiply by24:24 *2.303e-28=55.272e-28=5.5272e-27.

Divide by2:5.5272e-27 /2=2.7636e-27 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I think I messed up.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is 24 *k *e²/(m).

So 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, no, m is 2, so denominator is 2.

So 24 * k * e² / m =24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Which is:

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38: 215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 =5.53e-27.

Divide by 2: 5.53e-27 /2=2.765e-27 J.

Ah, so I see. Earlier, I thought the denominator was 2, leading to 2.76e-27 J.

But according to the problem statement, the 12 charges are at 2m from P, so r=2m.

So each U_i is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So 12 * [ (k*(4e²)) / (2m) ] = 12 * (2k e²/m) =24 k e²/m.

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Which is 24 * [8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ] /2.

Wait, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.303e-28.

24 *2.303e-28=55.27e-28.

Divide by 2:55.27e-28/2=27.635e-28=2.7635e-27 J.

So that's 2.76e-27 J.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the denominator to be r=2m, which is correct, but I'm not seeing the option.

Looking again, option C is 7.056e-27 J.

If I compute 24 *k*e²/m =7.056e-27, then:

24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2 =7.056e-27.

Let me compute left side:

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

215.712e9 *2.566e-38 = 5.53e-27.

Divide by2:5.53e-27/2=2.765e-27.

Which is not 7.056e-27.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k=9e9.

So 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

24 *9e9 =216e9.

216e9 *2.566e-38 =5.539e-27.

Divide by2:5.539e-27 /2=2.7695e-27 J.

Still not matching option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 2m, but the formula uses 4pi epsilon0, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, Coulomb's law uses 1/(4pi epsilon0) =k, so that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring the 12 charges into place, considering the field created by the 13th charge and the other charges as they're brought in.

In that case, the first charge would experience no field from the others, but each subsequent charge would experience the field from all the previously placed charges.

But that complicates things, and without knowing the order, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P, but the mutual potential energies are negligible, so I ignore them.

But that brings me back to the initial calculation of 5.53e-27 J, which isn't among the options.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I can't see where the discrepancy is. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =12*(k*4e²)/(2m)=24 k e²/m.

Let me compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.602e-19 =8.988 *1.602 =14.393 →14.393e-10.

Square that: (14.393e-10)^2 =207.15e-20 =2.0715e-18.

Multiply by 24:24 *2.0715e-18=49.716e-18=4.9716e-17.

Divide by 2:4.9716e-17/2=2.4858e-17.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm making a mistake in the order of operations.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck and perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't find a way to get that value from the given parameters. Perhaps I should recheck the initial problem statement for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem states that each charge is 2e, and there are 13 of them. 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P.

So potential energy is sum of U_ij for each pair between the 12 and the 13th.

Each U_ij = (8.988e9)*(2e)^2/(2m).

Which is 8.988e9 *4e²/(2m) = (8.988e9 *4e²)/ (2m) = (35.952e9 e²)/m.

Multiply by 12: 431.424e9 e²/m.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Each U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / r =8.988e9*(3.204e-19)^2 /2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 =1.0265e-37.

Multiply by8.988e9: 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 =9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28.

Multiply by 12:55.356e-28=5.5356e-27 J.

So, I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to approximately5.536e-27 J, which isn't one of the options.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have 12 charges, not 13, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the 13th charge. But that's what I already did.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately5.536e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher. But without further information, I can't reconcile this.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to remain at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The potential energy of the system is determined by summing the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge and Distance**: Each charge is \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The distance between the fixed charge at \( P \) and each of the 12 charges is \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Potential Energy Formula**: The potential energy between two charges is given by:
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \). For each pair involving the fixed charge and one of the 12 charges:
   \[
   U_i = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]

3. **Total Potential Energy**: Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy is:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U_i = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)
   - \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
   - \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \)

   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
   \]
   Compute step-by-step:
   - \( 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 2.303 \times 10^{-28} \)
   - \( 24 \cdot 2.303 \times 10^{-28} = 55.272 \times 10^{-28} = 5.5272 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value is approximately \( 5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \).
   - None of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is about 27% higher than the calculated result.

### Conclusion:
The calculated potential energy is \( 5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), but since this is not one of the options, the closest match is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**. While the discrepancy remains unexplained, this is the most reasonable choice based on the given options.

**Answer: C**
