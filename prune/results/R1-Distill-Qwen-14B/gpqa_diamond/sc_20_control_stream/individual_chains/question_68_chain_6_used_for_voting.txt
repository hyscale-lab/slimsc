Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on spin precession and magnetic moments. Let me think about what I know.

So, the magnetic moment mu is related to spin by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin components are Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues ±ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrices, I think. But when the magnetic field is applied, the spin will align with it, right?

Wait, initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the system's initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, the expectation value of the magnetic moment points along Z. Now, when the field is turned off, that's when the field along Z disappears, and a new field along Y is turned on. So the Hamiltonian changes from something proportional to Sz to something proportional to Sy.

Wait, the magnetic field creates a Hamiltonian proportional to the magnetic moment. Oh right, the Hamiltonian H for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. So initially, it's H_initial = -gamma * Sz * B_initial, right?

After the field is turned off, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma * Sy * B_final. Since the new magnetic field is along Y, same magnitude B, so H_final = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the magnetic field is switched suddenly. So the state of the system just after the switch is the same as the state before. Before, the state was an eigenstate of Sz. Let me denote the initial state as |+z> or |−z>. Because the spin is aligned with the magnetic field, the initial state should be the eigenstate where the energy is lowest (or highest, but for spin-1/2, the energy levels are split and the state would be the one with lower energy). So the initial state is |+z>, which is (1,0) in spinor notation.

Now, the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, Sy is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it in terms of angular frequency. The energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are E = ±(gamma B ħ)/2. Wait, but since the Hamiltonian here is proportional to Sy, the energy levels will be E = ± (gamma B ħ/2) multiplied by maybe a factor of i or something? Wait, no, Sy is (iħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So H = -gamma B (iħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, let me think about the form. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each is multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin components, so Sx = (ħ/2) sigma_x, etc.

So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z = gamma (ħ/2) sigma_z (times the eigenvalue, but as an operator). So the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = -mu · B. So H = -gamma B Sy.

Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Now, the time evolution of the state is governed by this Hamiltonian. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. Let me write |+z> as (1,0). What is the matrix form of sigma_y? Oh, it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, the Hamiltonian H is a matrix:

H = (-gamma B (ħ/2)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Hmm, so H is proportional to sigma_y, which has eigenstates that are eigenstates of Sy. So the eigenstates are |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

The initial state |+z> is a combination of |+y> and |−y> states. So when the system is in this state, it's not an eigenstate of H, so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for <mu_z> as a function of time.

Wait, mu_z is gamma times Sz, which is gamma (ħ/2) sigma_z. So <mu_z> = gamma (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

But to find <sigma_z>, we can compute the expectation value in the time-evolving state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the time dependence of the state and then compute the expectation value.

The time evolution is given by the time-dependent state |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but H is proportional to sigma_y, which doesn't commute with sigma_z. So the state will precess around the Y-axis.

To find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin, we can compute <Sz> = (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

So let's model this.

But maybe it's easier to find the energy eigenvalues and see how the state evolves.

The eigenvalues of H are E_+ and E_-, since H^2 is proportional to identity. Let me compute them.

H = (-gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So the eigenvalues E are (-gamma B ħ/2)(±1) = ± (-gamma B ħ/2). Wait, but the energy levels are E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = -gamma B ħ/2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so H has eigenvalues ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) * (+1) and ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) * (-1). So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) = - (gamma B ħ)/2, and E_minus = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, but the energy levels would be symmetric around zero. So the energy difference between the two states is E_plus - E_minus = -gamma B ħ.

Wait, but when we have a two-level system, the frequency of oscillations is determined by the energy difference divided by h-bar. The transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (-gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2 )) / ħ? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

So E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, no, E_+ is minus (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- is positive (gamma B ħ)/2. So E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2) - (gamma B ħ/2) ) = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let's re-calculate:

H = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Sigma_y's eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So H eigenvalues are:

E = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) * (1) = - (gamma B ħ)/2,

and E = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) * (-1) = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

So E_plus is (+gamma B ħ/2), E_minus is (-gamma B ħ/2).

So the energy difference between the two states is E_plus - E_minus = (gamma B ħ/2) - (-gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the angular frequency omega is (E_plus - E_minus)/ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The general formula for the frequency of oscillation in a two-level system is omega = (E_+ - E_-)/ħ. So in this case, omega is gamma B.

But wait, the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>. So the time evolution will cause the state to precess, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Now, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

So to find <sigma_z> as a function of time, we can express the state |psi(t)> as a combination of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |−y>.

Alternatively, perhaps using the time evolution operator, we can expand |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>, apply the time evolution, and then compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the time evolution is given by the rotation around the Y-axis. Let me think about how the spin state evolves.

The time evolution under H is given by:

|psi(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

But H is proportional to sigma_y, so H t / ħ = ( -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y ) t / ħ ) = (- gamma B t sigma_y / 2 )

So H t / ħ = (- gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y.

The exponential of sigma_y is a rotation in spin space. The exponential of i theta sigma_y is equivalent to a rotation by angle theta about the Y-axis.

Wait, but the time evolution operator is e^(-i H t / ħ), which is e^(i theta sigma_y/2), where theta is (gamma B t ). Because H t/ ħ is proportional to sigma_y times (-gamma B t/ 2), so the exponent is -i * [ (-gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y ] = i (gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y.

So the operator becomes e^{i (gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y / 1 }, but wait, because sigma_y is multiplied by (gamma B t / 2 ), but e^{i theta J} where J is the generator. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of rotation operators. The rotation operator around the Y-axis by angle phi is R_y(phi) = e^(-i phi S_y / ħ). Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, this becomes R_y(phi) = e^(-i phi (sigma_y)/2 ).

In our case, the time evolution operator is e^{i (gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y }, because:

H = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) sigma_y,

so H t / ħ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2 sigma_y) t / ħ ) = (- gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2.

Thus, the time evolution operator is:

e^{ -i H t / ħ } = e^{ i (gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2 }.

Which is the same as R_y( -gamma B t ), because the rotation operator is e^(-i phi sigma_y / 2 ), so here we have e^{i phi sigma_y / 2 }, which would be R_y(-phi), because the rotation direction depends on the sign. So maybe phi is gamma B t.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the time evolution in terms of the spin precession. The state |+z> is initially pointing along +z. When the magnetic field is applied along Y, the spin will precess about the Y-axis.

The spin precession frequency is determined by the energy difference, which we've established as gamma B. So the angular frequency omega is gamma B.

Now, the expectation value of Sz (the z-component of spin) will oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency. Because as the spin precesses around Y, the projection onto Z will vary.

So the average of mu_z, which is gamma <Sz>, will oscillate with frequency omega = gamma B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is applied along Y, the state starts to precess around Y. The expectation value of Sz will vary sinusoidally with time.

The frequency of oscillation (angular frequency) is given by the energy splitting over ħ. The energy splitting is E_plus - E_minus = gamma B ħ, so the angular frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The energy difference is E_plus - E_minus = gamma B ħ, so the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.

But wait, another approach: the time dependence of the expectation value of Sz.

The initial state is |+z> = (1, 0).

The time evolution under H is given by |psi(t)> = e^(-i H t/ ħ) |+z>.

H is (-gamma B (ħ/2)) sigma_y. So H = (- gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So the time evolution operator is e^{ i (gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2 }.

Expressing sigma_y in terms of Pauli matrices, which are [[0, -i], [i,0]], so sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The exponential of i theta sigma_y/2 is a rotation matrix. For any theta, e^{i theta sigma_y/2} equals cos(theta/2) I + i sin(theta/2) sigma_y.

So the operator becomes:

cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) I + i sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) sigma_y.

So when we apply this to |+z> = (1, 0)^T, we get:

[ cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) , i sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) ]^T.

So the state at time t is (cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2)), where theta = gamma B t.

Now, to find <Sz>, which is (ħ/2) <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)>.

Sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So let's compute the expectation value <sigma_z>:

<sigma_z> = [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^† sigma_z [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Multiplying this out:

The first component is cos(theta/2) * 1 * cos(theta/2) + (-i sin(theta/2)) ) * (-i sin(theta/2)) * (-1).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it explicitly.

The state is a column vector [a, b]^T where a = cos(theta/2), b = i sin(theta/2).

Then, the bra is [a*, -b*] = [cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2)].

Multiply by sigma_z:

sigma_z * [a; b] = [a; -b].

Then, the inner product is [a*, -b*] * [a; -b] = a a* + (-b^*) (-b) )= |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Wait, no: Wait, [a*, -b*] multiplied by [a; -b] is a* a + (-b*) (-b) ) = |a|^2 + |b|^2.

But since |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, the expectation value <sigma_z> is 1.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that <Sz> is constant, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go step by step.

The state |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta = gamma B t.

Sigma_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So sigma_z |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Then, the inner product <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2) ] [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So it's cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + (-i sin(theta/2)) * (i sin(theta/2)).

Compute each term:

cos^2(theta/2) + [ (-i)(i) sin^2(theta/2) ) ].

(-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is sin^2(theta/2).

So total is cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem states that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So according to this, the expectation value is 1, which is constant.

That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try again. The state |psi(t)> is [a, b]^T with a = cos(theta/2), b = i sin(theta/2).

Sigma_z [a; b] = [a; -b].

Then, <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)> is [a*, -b*] [a; -b] = a a* + (-b^*) (-b).

Compute a a* = cos^2(theta/2).

(-b^*) is the complex conjugate of b, which is (-i sin(theta/2)).

So (-b^*) (-b) = (-i sin(theta/2)) * (-i sin(theta/2)) ) = (-i)^2 sin^2(theta/2) = (-1) sin^2(theta/2).

So the total is cos^2(theta/2) + (-1) sin^2(theta/2) = cos^2 - sin^2 = cos(theta).

So <sigma_z> = cos(theta), where theta is gamma B t.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(theta) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Thus, the expectation value of mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but mu_z is the magnetic moment, which is gamma times spin_z, so yes.

So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B.

Looking at the options, the answer is B) gamma*B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, denoted as $|+z\rangle$, which corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned along $+z$.

2. **Hamiltonian After Field Switch**: After the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]
   where $\sigma_y$ is the Pauli $y$-matrix.

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$, so the state evolves over time. The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar} = e^{i\frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y}.
   \]

4. **Spin Precession**: The eigenvalues of $H$ are $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$, corresponding to energy levels $E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$. The energy splitting is $\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = \gamma B \hbar$, and the angular frequency of oscillation is:
   \[
   \omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**: The magnetic moment $\mu_z$ is related to the $z$-component of the spin as $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates sinusoidally with time due to the precession of the spin around the $y$-axis. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting, which is $\omega = \gamma B$.

6. **Verification**: The time evolution of the state and the expectation value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ confirm that the oscillation frequency is indeed $\omega = \gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on spin precession and magnetic moments. Let me think about what I know.

So, the magnetic moment mu is related to spin by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin components are Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues ±ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrices, I think. But when the magnetic field is applied, the spin will align with it, right?

Wait, initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the system's initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, the expectation value of the magnetic moment points along Z. Now, when the field is turned off, that's when the field along Z disappears, and a new field along Y is turned on. So the Hamiltonian changes from something proportional to Sz to something proportional to Sy.

Wait, the magnetic field creates a Hamiltonian proportional to the magnetic moment. Oh right, the Hamiltonian H for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. So initially, it's H_initial = -gamma * Sz * B_initial, right?

After the field is turned off, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma * Sy * B_final. Since the new magnetic field is along Y, same magnitude B, so H_final = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the magnetic field is switched suddenly. So the state of the system just after the switch is the same as the state before. Before, the state was an eigenstate of Sz. Let me denote the initial state as |+z> or |−z>. Because the spin is aligned with the magnetic field, the initial state should be the eigenstate where the energy is lowest (or highest, but for spin-1/2, the energy levels are split and the state would be the one with lower energy). So the initial state is |+z>, which is (1,0) in spinor notation.

Now, the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, Sy is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it in terms of angular frequency. The energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are E = ±(gamma B ħ)/2. Wait, but since the Hamiltonian here is proportional to Sy, the energy levels will be E = ± (gamma B ħ/2) multiplied by maybe a factor of i or something? Wait, no, Sy is (iħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So H = -gamma B (iħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, let me think about the form. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each is multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin components, so Sx = (ħ/2) sigma_x, etc.

So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z = gamma (ħ/2) sigma_z (times the eigenvalue, but as an operator). So the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = -mu · B. So H = -gamma B Sy.

Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Now, the time evolution of the state is governed by this Hamiltonian. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. Let me write |+z> as (1,0). What is the matrix form of sigma_y? Oh, it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, the Hamiltonian H is a matrix:

H = (-gamma B (ħ/2)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Hmm, so H is proportional to sigma_y, which has eigenstates that are eigenstates of Sy. So the eigenstates are |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

The initial state |+z> is a combination of |+y> and |−y> states. So when the system is in this state, it's not an eigenstate of H, so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for <mu_z> as a function of time.

Wait, mu_z is gamma times Sz, which is gamma (ħ/2) sigma_z. So <mu_z> = gamma (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

But to find <sigma_z>, we can compute the expectation value in the time-evolving state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the time dependence of the state and then compute the expectation value.

The time evolution is given by the time-dependent state |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but H is proportional to sigma_y, which doesn't commute with sigma_z. So the state will precess around the Y-axis.

To find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin, we can compute <Sz> = (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

So let's model this.

But maybe it's easier to find the energy eigenvalues and see how the state evolves.

The eigenvalues of H are E_+ and E_-, since H^2 is proportional to identity. Let me compute them.

H = (-gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So the eigenvalues E are (-gamma B ħ/2)(±1) = ± (-gamma B ħ/2). Wait, but the energy levels are E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = -gamma B ħ/2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so H has eigenvalues ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) * (+1) and ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) * (-1). So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) = - (gamma B ħ)/2, and E_minus = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, but the energy levels would be symmetric around zero. So the energy difference between the two states is E_plus - E_minus = -gamma B ħ.

Wait, but when we have a two-level system, the frequency of oscillations is determined by the energy difference divided by h-bar. The transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (-gamma B ħ/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2 )) / ħ? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

So E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, no, E_+ is minus (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- is positive (gamma B ħ)/2. So E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2) - (gamma B ħ/2) ) = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let's re-calculate:

H = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Sigma_y's eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So H eigenvalues are:

E = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) * (1) = - (gamma B ħ)/2,

and E = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) * (-1) = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

So E_plus is (+gamma B ħ/2), E_minus is (-gamma B ħ/2).

So the energy difference between the two states is E_plus - E_minus = (gamma B ħ/2) - (-gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the angular frequency omega is (E_plus - E_minus)/ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The general formula for the frequency of oscillation in a two-level system is omega = (E_+ - E_-)/ħ. So in this case, omega is gamma B.

But wait, the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>. So the time evolution will cause the state to precess, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Now, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2) <sigma_z>.

So to find <sigma_z> as a function of time, we can express the state |psi(t)> as a combination of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |−y>.

Alternatively, perhaps using the time evolution operator, we can expand |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>, apply the time evolution, and then compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the time evolution is given by the rotation around the Y-axis. Let me think about how the spin state evolves.

The time evolution under H is given by:

|psi(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

But H is proportional to sigma_y, so H t / ħ = ( -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y ) t / ħ ) = (- gamma B t sigma_y / 2 )

So H t / ħ = (- gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y.

The exponential of sigma_y is a rotation in spin space. The exponential of i theta sigma_y is equivalent to a rotation by angle theta about the Y-axis.

Wait, but the time evolution operator is e^(-i H t / ħ), which is e^(i theta sigma_y/2), where theta is (gamma B t ). Because H t/ ħ is proportional to sigma_y times (-gamma B t/ 2), so the exponent is -i * [ (-gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y ] = i (gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y.

So the operator becomes e^{i (gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y / 1 }, but wait, because sigma_y is multiplied by (gamma B t / 2 ), but e^{i theta J} where J is the generator. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of rotation operators. The rotation operator around the Y-axis by angle phi is R_y(phi) = e^(-i phi S_y / ħ). Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, this becomes R_y(phi) = e^(-i phi (sigma_y)/2 ).

In our case, the time evolution operator is e^{i (gamma B t/ 2 ) sigma_y }, because:

H = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) sigma_y,

so H t / ħ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2 sigma_y) t / ħ ) = (- gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2.

Thus, the time evolution operator is:

e^{ -i H t / ħ } = e^{ i (gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2 }.

Which is the same as R_y( -gamma B t ), because the rotation operator is e^(-i phi sigma_y / 2 ), so here we have e^{i phi sigma_y / 2 }, which would be R_y(-phi), because the rotation direction depends on the sign. So maybe phi is gamma B t.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the time evolution in terms of the spin precession. The state |+z> is initially pointing along +z. When the magnetic field is applied along Y, the spin will precess about the Y-axis.

The spin precession frequency is determined by the energy difference, which we've established as gamma B. So the angular frequency omega is gamma B.

Now, the expectation value of Sz (the z-component of spin) will oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency. Because as the spin precesses around Y, the projection onto Z will vary.

So the average of mu_z, which is gamma <Sz>, will oscillate with frequency omega = gamma B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is applied along Y, the state starts to precess around Y. The expectation value of Sz will vary sinusoidally with time.

The frequency of oscillation (angular frequency) is given by the energy splitting over ħ. The energy splitting is E_plus - E_minus = gamma B ħ, so the angular frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The energy difference is E_plus - E_minus = gamma B ħ, so the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.

But wait, another approach: the time dependence of the expectation value of Sz.

The initial state is |+z> = (1, 0).

The time evolution under H is given by |psi(t)> = e^(-i H t/ ħ) |+z>.

H is (-gamma B (ħ/2)) sigma_y. So H = (- gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

So the time evolution operator is e^{ i (gamma B t sigma_y ) / 2 }.

Expressing sigma_y in terms of Pauli matrices, which are [[0, -i], [i,0]], so sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The exponential of i theta sigma_y/2 is a rotation matrix. For any theta, e^{i theta sigma_y/2} equals cos(theta/2) I + i sin(theta/2) sigma_y.

So the operator becomes:

cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) I + i sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) sigma_y.

So when we apply this to |+z> = (1, 0)^T, we get:

[ cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) , i sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) ]^T.

So the state at time t is (cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2)), where theta = gamma B t.

Now, to find <Sz>, which is (ħ/2) <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)>.

Sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So let's compute the expectation value <sigma_z>:

<sigma_z> = [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^† sigma_z [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Multiplying this out:

The first component is cos(theta/2) * 1 * cos(theta/2) + (-i sin(theta/2)) ) * (-i sin(theta/2)) * (-1).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it explicitly.

The state is a column vector [a, b]^T where a = cos(theta/2), b = i sin(theta/2).

Then, the bra is [a*, -b*] = [cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2)].

Multiply by sigma_z:

sigma_z * [a; b] = [a; -b].

Then, the inner product is [a*, -b*] * [a; -b] = a a* + (-b^*) (-b) )= |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Wait, no: Wait, [a*, -b*] multiplied by [a; -b] is a* a + (-b*) (-b) ) = |a|^2 + |b|^2.

But since |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, the expectation value <sigma_z> is 1.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that <Sz> is constant, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go step by step.

The state |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta = gamma B t.

Sigma_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So sigma_z |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Then, the inner product <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)> is [ cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2) ] [ cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So it's cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + (-i sin(theta/2)) * (i sin(theta/2)).

Compute each term:

cos^2(theta/2) + [ (-i)(i) sin^2(theta/2) ) ].

(-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is sin^2(theta/2).

So total is cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem states that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So according to this, the expectation value is 1, which is constant.

That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try again. The state |psi(t)> is [a, b]^T with a = cos(theta/2), b = i sin(theta/2).

Sigma_z [a; b] = [a; -b].

Then, <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)> is [a*, -b*] [a; -b] = a a* + (-b^*) (-b).

Compute a a* = cos^2(theta/2).

(-b^*) is the complex conjugate of b, which is (-i sin(theta/2)).

So (-b^*) (-b) = (-i sin(theta/2)) * (-i sin(theta/2)) ) = (-i)^2 sin^2(theta/2) = (-1) sin^2(theta/2).

So the total is cos^2(theta/2) + (-1) sin^2(theta/2) = cos^2 - sin^2 = cos(theta).

So <sigma_z> = cos(theta), where theta is gamma B t.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(theta) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Thus, the expectation value of mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but mu_z is the magnetic moment, which is gamma times spin_z, so yes.

So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B.

Looking at the options, the answer is B) gamma*B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a magnetic field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, denoted as $|+z\rangle$, which corresponds to the magnetic moment being aligned along $+z$.

2. **Hamiltonian After Field Switch**: After the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]
   where $\sigma_y$ is the Pauli $y$-matrix.

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$, so the state evolves over time. The time evolution operator is:
   \[
   U(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar} = e^{i\frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y}.
   \]

4. **Spin Precession**: The eigenvalues of $H$ are $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$, corresponding to energy levels $E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$. The energy splitting is $\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = \gamma B \hbar$, and the angular frequency of oscillation is:
   \[
   \omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**: The magnetic moment $\mu_z$ is related to the $z$-component of the spin as $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates sinusoidally with time due to the precession of the spin around the $y$-axis. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting, which is $\omega = \gamma B$.

6. **Verification**: The time evolution of the state and the expectation value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ confirm that the oscillation frequency is indeed $\omega = \gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
