Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The task is to determine how many peaks appear in each chromatogram.

First, let me read the problem again carefully.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

After both reactions are complete, the products are combined. Then, they're run on a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC. We need to find the number of peaks observed in each.

Okay, let's break this down step by step.

I think the first thing I need to do is figure out what each reaction produces.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one will be reduced.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is: 

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(=O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, the substituent is on the 5th carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me write it properly.

Hexan-3-one: the ketone is at position 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, hexan-3-one is actually CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the numbering is from the end. Hexan-3-one is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So, the carbonyl is between C3 and C4. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbon chain is six carbons long, with the ketone on C3.

But in the given compound, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the methoxy group is on C5.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3? So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be 5-methoxy, so the methoxy is on C5, which is the fourth carbon in the chain from the ketone. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

So, the compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the ketone is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's seven carbons. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons. So positions are 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4, 5 (with OCH3), 6.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's 7 carbons, which is heptan. No, wait, hexan has six carbons. So, perhaps I messed up the structure.

Wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? No, that's only five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, hexan-3-one has six carbons, with the ketone on C3.

So, positions 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4, 5, 6.

The 5 position has a methoxy group.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction.

Reaction I is treatment with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group becomes a CHOH group.

But wait, the starting material is a ketone, so when reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, the position of the OH would be on the same carbon as the ketone. So, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait. When you reduce a ketone, you add two hydrogens: the carbonyl becomes a CHOH.

So, the starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's more accurately represented as:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-(CH2)2-CH3? No, that may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be 7 carbons again. Hmm, maybe the correct structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. No, hexan-3-one is six carbons. Let me count again.

Hexan-3-one: positions are 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4, 5, 6.

So, 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: CO, 4: CH2, 5: CH2, 6: CH3. Wait, no, that would be 3-pentanone, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the IUPAC name. Hexan-3-one would have the structure:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, that's butan-2-one. Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the product first.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone at position 3 becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the stereocenter (if any) will depend on the starting material. The starting material is (S) configuration, so the product will have a new stereocenter.

Wait, when LAH reduces a ketone, it adds two hydrogens: one from LAH and another (maybe from the solvent?), but in any case, the product is a secondary alcohol. So, the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no, wait: wait, the structure after reduction. Let me see: the starting compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

After reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH(OH) group. So, the structure becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, the starting material was (S) configuration at C5 because it's 5-methoxy, which is a stereocenter. Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a ketone. So, the carbonyl is on C3. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C4. The methoxy is on C5.

So, the starting molecule is (S)-configured at C5. When we reduce C3 (the ketone), the new OH group is on C3. So, the product has a new stereocenter at C3.

Wait, but in the starting compound, C5 is a stereocenter because of the methoxy group. So after reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter, and C5 remains as it was.

So, the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but with a new stereocenter at C3. Wait, no, the starting material's configuration is at C5 as S. After reduction, the new OH is on C3, which was the former ketone. So, the new molecule has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has a methoxy group on C5, which is a stereocenter. So, the starting molecule is (S) configuration at C5. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter at C3. So, the product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters.

But wait, the product is (from the reduction of a single enantiomer) going to form a single enantiomer of the diol? Or is the new stereocenter the same as before?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and when it reduces a ketone, the addition is typically not stereoselective because the ketone is a planar sp2 center. So, the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture of the two possible stereocenters. Wait, but wait, the existing stereocenter is at C5 (from the methoxy group), and the new OH is at C3 which was the ketone.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, when the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration at C3 can be R or S. Wait, but in reality, since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S configuration at C5), and the reduction of the ketone is not stereoselective, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but the existing C5 remains S. So, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 (new, racemic) and C5 (S).

But wait, hold on. The starting molecule has a chiral center at C5. The reduction of the ketone (C3) introduces another chiral center. Since the ketone is planar, the addition of the hydride could come from either face, leading to a 50:50 mixture at C3, but the C5 remains as S.

So, the product from Reaction I would be a mixture of two diastereomers: each has C5 as S, but C3 could be R or S.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The molecule is chiral at C5. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol at C3, which becomes a new chiral center. So, the product will have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Since the reduction of the ketone is not stereospecific, the product will be a racemic mixture at C3. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the overall product will have four possible stereoisomers? No, wait: the starting material has a single stereocenter (C5, S), and upon reduction, the new stereocenter (C3) can be R or S. So, the product will be a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers: one where C3 is R and C5 is S, the other where C3 is S and C5 is S.

Wait, no. Let me think. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5, which is the configuration before reduction. The reduction adds an OH group to C3, which was a ketone (sp2). So, the addition of H- from LAH can come from either side, leading to formation of both R and S configurations at C3. So, the product is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers at C3, but the C5 remains as S. Therefore, the product is a diastereomeric mixture of two different compounds: one with C3 R and C5 S, the other with C3 S and C5 S.

Wait, but that would mean the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture at C3, but C5 remains as S. So, the product is (S,S) and (R,S) configurations, each with 50% ratio.

Wait, but wait: no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer (S configuration at C5), the product will have C5 as S and the new C3 as a racemic mixture. So, the product is a mixture of two diastereomers: each has C5 as S, but C3 as R or S. So, the product would be two diastereomers, each with equal amounts. So, the product is a 50:50 mixture of (S,S) and (R,S) configurations? Wait, no, because the starting material is (S) at C5, and the new C3, which is in a different position, so the two diastereomers would have configurations (S, R) and (S, S) at C5 and C3 respectively.

So, Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers: each has one stereocenter at C5 (S) and another at C3 (R or S). So, two possible stereoisomers.

Now, moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(=O))2CH. Its structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, let me count. Pentane has five carbons. So, positions 2 and 4 are the ketone groups.

So, the structure is: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no: pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that would be six carbons. Wait, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone with two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain.

So, structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, it's a symmetrical molecule; the two ketone groups are on C2 and C4, with CH2 in the middle. So, it's (CH3)2C(O)CH2CO(CH3)2? No, wait: it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, it's O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons: positions 1 (CH3), 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (C=O), 5 (CH3).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, pentane is five carbons. So, positions 1,2,3,4,5: positions 2 and 4 are the ketones.

So, the structure is:

CH2(COCH3)-CH2-COCH3? No, perhaps it's easier to write it as CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, the molecule is symmetrical, with two ketone groups.

Now, when NaBH4 is used. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a weaker reductant compared to LAH. However, in this case, it's stated that excess NaBH4 is used.

NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But in the case of a diketone, each ketone group would be reduced.

So, pentane-2,4-dione (CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3) would be reduced to (CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3). So, the product would be pentane-2,4-diol.

Wait, but wait, the structure upon reduction would be:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

But wait, each ketone (C=O) becomes a CHOH group. So, the two ketones become two secondary alcohols.

But wait, the question says that the reducing agent is NaBH4 and it's in excess, so it's likely that both ketones are reduced. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But let me think about the stereochemistry here. When NaBH4 (a chiral reducing agent?) reduces a ketone, does it induce any stereochemistry?

Wait, NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? Or does it reduce ketones without any stereoselectivity?

Wait, no, in the case of a planar ketone, the hydride can attack from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. But in the case of a symmetrical ketone, the product would be a single compound because the two possible diastereomers are identical.

In pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is in a symmetrical position. So, when each ketone is reduced, the product would be a single diastereomer? Or not, because each reduction could lead to a mixture.

Wait, no, let me think again. Each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical because the two ketone groups are identical and the molecule is symmetrical. So, when each ketone is reduced, each would give a secondary alcohol. Since the molecule is symmetrical, the two CHOH groups would be in equivalent environments. Therefore, the product would be a single compound. But wait, each reduction would lead to a racemic mixture, but in this case, since the molecule is symmetric, the two possible diastereomers (if any) would be identical. So, the product would be a single compound: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

Wait, let's see: the product structure after reduction would be CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. Now, is this a meso compound?

Yes, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two OH groups are on C2 and C4. The molecule is symmetric around the center, so the configuration at each OH is mirrored. So, the product would be a meso compound, which has two stereocenters but is achiral because of the plane of symmetry.

So, Reaction II produces a single meso compound, 2,4-pentanediol, which is not chiral.

Now, combining the products of both reactions: Reaction I gives a mixture of two diastereomers (each with two stereocenters), and Reaction II gives a single meso compound.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me clarify the products:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH → product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. C5 is S, and C3 is a racemic mixture (50% R, 50% S). So, the product is a 1:1 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations.

So, Reaction I produces two diastereomers.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single compound (not chiral).

So, when the products are combined, the mixture contains:

From Reaction I: two diastereomers (each with two stereocenters; 50% each).

From Reaction II: one compound (meso, no stereocenters because it's achiral).

Now, when running these on HPLC columns, we need to determine how many peaks appear in each.

The two HPLC columns are:

1. Normal-phase HPLC: This type of HPLC separates compounds based on their polarity. The stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. Compounds with higher polarity tend to elute earlier. The number of peaks corresponds to the number of distinct compounds.

2. Chiral HPLC column: This separates enantiomers. So, if a compound is chiral, its enantiomers will elute as separate peaks. If a compound is meso or achiral, it won't split into peaks.

So, let's analyze the combined products.

From Reaction I:

Two diastereomers (each with two stereocenters, C3 and C5):

Diastereomer 1: (R,S) configuration.

Diastereomer 2: (S,S) configuration.

These are two distinct compounds. So in normal-phase HPLC, they will be separated into two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, each diastereomer (which has two stereocenters) may or may not be chiral. Wait, diastereomers are not necessarily chiral. Wait, each diastereomer is a stereoisomer, but whether they are chiral or not depends on their structure.

Wait, each diastereomer has two stereocenters. Let me think about whether they are chiral.

The product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is:

The molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

If both C3 and C5 are stereocenters, then each diastereomer (R,S and S,S) must be chiral unless they have a plane of symmetry.

But for each diastereomer, let's see:

Diastereomer 1: C3 is R, C5 is S.

Is there a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the structure. The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

If the two substituents around each stereocenter are different, then the molecule is chiral.

Yes, each diastereomer (R,S and S,S) is chiral because each has two different substituents around each chiral center. So, each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. Wait, each diastereomer is a single stereoisomer, not a pair. Each diastereomer is a distinct stereoisomer, and each may exist as an enantiomer.

Wait, no. No, the diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. So, each diastereomer is a single compound, which may itself be chiral.

Wait, for example, if a molecule has two stereocenters and the two are not related by a plane of symmetry, then each diastereomer is a separate stereoisomer. Each of these could potentially be chiral, meaning that each would have an enantiomer.

But in this case, each diastereomer comes from the reaction, so in the product, each diastereomer is present as a racemic mixture? No, wait.

Wait, in Reaction I, the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers.

Each of these diastereomers is a single stereoisomer. So, each has an enantiomer. Let me think:

Diastereomer 1: (R,S) → its enantiomer would be (S,R).

Diastereomer 2: (S,S) → its enantiomer would be (R,R).

But in the product from Reaction I, only (R,S) and (S,S) are present. So, the mixture contains both of these, each as a single enantiomer.

Wait, but this confuses me. Because when a ketone is reduced with a non-stereoselective agent, the product would be a racemic mixture at the new stereocenter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The starting material has a single stereocenter at C5 (S). The reduction introduces a new stereocenter at C3, which is a racemic mixture (50% R, 50% S). So, the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers.

So, each diastereomer is a single stereoisomer. Now, each stereoisomer may or may not be chiral.

If the molecule has two stereocenters and no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. So, let's imagine the structure:

5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

The molecule has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Would this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's think about the structure.

The molecule is CH2CH2-CHOH-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, maybe it's better to imagine the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(OH)H-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CHOH-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Positions:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C(OH)H (since that's where the alcohol is)

4: CH(OCH3)

5: CH2

6: CH3.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure has no plane of symmetry. So, each diastereomer would be chiral and have an enantiomer.

But in the product, only two diastereomers are present: (R,S) and (S,S). Each would have their own enantiomers (S,R) and (R,R), but those are not present in the product.

So, when running a chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would elute as a separate peak. But in this case, the product from Reaction I has two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the product from Reaction I, the two diastereomers are present as racemic mixtures? No, because the starting material was (S) at C5, and the new stereocenter at C3 is racemic.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. Upon reduction, the new OH is at C3. The configuration at C3 can be R or S, each with 50% probability. The C5 remains as S. So the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations.

Each of these is a single stereoisomer, which is chiral. So, each (R,S) and (S,S) is a chiral molecule, but their enantiomers are (S,R) and (R,S), respectively. Wait, no: the enantiomer of (R,S) would be (S,R), which is a different diastereomer.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think about diastereomers and enantiomers.

Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are mirror images.

So, (R,S) and (S,R) are enantiomers of each other. Similarly, (S,S) and (R,R) are enantiomers.

In the product from Reaction I, the mixture contains (R,S) and (S,S), each as 50% of the mixture. So, none of their enantiomers are present.

Now, when running on a chiral HPLC column, each enantiomer would produce a separate peak. So, if a compound is chiral and present in a racemic mixture, it would show two peaks. But in this case, the product is a diastereomeric mixture, not a racemic mixture.

Wait, no. The product has two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer. So, when run on a chiral column, each would produce a peak, but since they are diastereomers, their retention times would differ.

Wait, but chiral HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers would also be separated because they are not identical, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, chiral columns are selective for enantiomers. Diastereomers may have different interactions with the stationary phase, so they would also elute at different times, leading to separate peaks.

So, in the chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would give a separate peak, and each enantiomer would as well.

Wait, but in this case, each diastereomer is a single enantiomer. So, in the mixture from Reaction I, there are two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer. So, when run on a chiral HPLC, each would produce a peak. So, two peaks from Reaction I.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The two diastereomers from Reaction I are:

1. (R,S) → this is a single enantiomer.

2. (S,S) → this is another single enantiomer.

So, each is a distinct compound, and each is chiral. So, when run on a chiral HPLC, each would produce a peak. So, two peaks.

Additionally, Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is 2,4-pentanediol. Since it's a meso compound, it's achiral, so it won't produce two peaks on a chiral column. Instead, it will elute as a single peak.

Wait, but the product is only one compound, so on a chiral column, it would produce one peak.

Wait, no. Meso compounds are achiral, so they would pass through a chiral column without separating into enantiomers. So, they would give a single peak.

So, combining all products:

From Reaction I: two diastereomers, each chiral → 2 peaks on chiral HPLC.

From Reaction II: one meso compound → 1 peak on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but Reaction II's product is only one compound, which is a meso compound. So, in the combined mixture, from both reactions, the chiral HPLC would see:

- Two peaks from Reaction I's diastereomers.

- One peak from Reaction II's product.

Total of three peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, no, because Reaction I's two diastereomers are each chiral, so each would produce a peak. But wait, no: the two diastereomers are each a single enantiomer, so each would produce one peak. So, two peaks from Reaction I, and one peak from Reaction II, totaling three peaks on the chiral column.

In the normal-phase HPLC, all distinct compounds would produce a peak. So, Reaction I produces two different diastereomers, and Reaction II produces one compound. So, three different compounds in total, leading to three peaks.

Wait, but wait: the two diastereomers from Reaction I are two different compounds, and the meso compound from Reaction II is another. So, total three compounds → three peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

Hmm, but wait, what about the actual structures? Let me try to imagine the structures.

From Reaction I: two diastereomers, each has two stereocenters. So, they are different compounds, each with a distinct structure. So, in normal-phase HPLC, they'll be separated into two peaks.

Additionally, Reaction II's product is a meso compound (2,4-pentanediol), so it's a single compound. So, in normal-phase HPLC, that's a third peak.

So, the normal-phase HPLC would have three peaks: two from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

Wait, but wait, the reaction products are combined. So, the mixture contains:

- Diastereomer 1: (R,S) → one compound.

- Diastereomer 2: (S,S) → another compound.

- Meso compound from Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol → third compound.

So, three distinct compounds → three peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

On the chiral HPLC:

- Diastereomer 1: (R,S) → chiral → one peak.

- Diastereomer 2: (S,S) → chiral → another peak.

- Meso compound → not chiral → one peak.

Total three peaks on both columns? Wait, but the meso compound would elute as one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral?

Wait, no. On the normal-phase HPLC, the meso compound is one peak. On the chiral HPLC, it's also one peak because it's not chiral. So, the chiral HPLC would have:

From Reaction I: two peaks.

From Reaction II: one peak.

Total of three peaks.

Wait, but earlier I thought the normal-phase would have three peaks, and the chiral would have three as well. Wait, but that's not matching the options given.

Looking back at the options:

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Wait, according to my analysis, normal-phase would have three peaks and chiral would have three as well. So, option D would be the answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in considering the number of stereoisomers. Let me re-examine Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH, which reduces the ketone to an alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3. The product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations.

Each of these (R,S) and (S,S) is a diastereomer and a chiral molecule. So, when run on a chiral column, each would give a peak. So, two peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is a single compound, so one peak on both columns.

So, the total on chiral column: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 3 peaks.

On normal-phase HPLC: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 3 peaks.

So, answer D: 3 peaks in both columns.

But wait, I'm now confused because I thought Reaction II's product is a single compound, and Reaction I gives two, making three in total. So, both columns would have three peaks each.

But looking at the options, option D says 3 in both. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the products from Reaction I are actually two diastereomers, each of which consists of an enantiomeric pair.

Wait, no. Reaction I produces a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations. Each of these is a single stereoisomer, each is chiral, and each has its own enantiomer.

But in the product, the only stereoisomers present are (R,S) and (S,S). So, each is a single enantiomer. Therefore, on a chiral column, each would give a peak, leading to two peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is not chiral, so on the chiral column, it would appear as a single peak.

So, in total, on the chiral column: 2 + 1 = 3 peaks.

On normal-phase: same, 3 peaks.

So, the answer is D: 3 peaks in both.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. When the product from Reaction I is run on a normal-phase HPLC, it's two diastereomers (so two peaks), and Reaction II's product is another compound (third peak). So, three peaks on normal-phase.

On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer is chiral, so each gives a peak (two peaks), plus Reaction II's product (one peak), totaling three. So, both columns have three peaks.

Therefore, the answer would be D.

But let me think again. What if the two diastereomers from Reaction I are actually enantiomers? No, diastereomers are not mirror images, while enantiomers are.

If Reaction I's two diastereomers are enantiomers, then they would be a racemic mixture, and on a chiral column, they would produce two peaks. But in this case, the two diastereomers are not enantiomers; they're diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the number of peaks on each column.

Normal-phase HPLC: separates based on polarity. Each distinct compound is a peak.

So, from Reaction I: two distinct diastereomers → two peaks.

From Reaction II: one compound → one peak.

Total: three peaks on normal-phase.

Chiral HPLC: separates based on chirality.

Each chiral compound → two peaks if it's a racemic mixture, one peak if it's a single enantiomer.

So, Reaction I's products: each is a single enantiomer (since the product is a 50:50 mixture of R,S and S,S, each as individual enantiomers), so each would produce a peak on the chiral HPLC. So, two peaks.

Reaction II's product: meso, so it's not chiral → one peak.

Total on chiral HPLC: 2 + 1 = 3 peaks.

So, both columns have three peaks. Answer D.

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH
- **Reduction with LAH**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter at C3. The starting material has a stereocenter at C5 (S configuration). 
- **Product**: A 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S). Each diastereomer is chiral.
- **Outcome**:
  - On **normal-phase HPLC**: Two distinct peaks for the two diastereomers.
  - On **chiral HPLC**: Two peaks, as each diastereomer is chiral and will elute separately.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione + NaBH4
- **Reduction with NaBH4**: Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
- **Product**: A single meso compound (2,4-pentanediol), which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.
- **Outcome**:
  - On **normal-phase HPLC**: One peak for the meso compound.
  - On **chiral HPLC**: One peak, as the meso compound is achiral and does not separate into enantiomers.

---

### Combined Products
- **From Reaction I**: Two diastereomers (R,S and S,S), each chiral.
- **From Reaction II**: One meso compound (2,4-pentanediol), achiral.
- **Total compounds**: Three distinct compounds.

### Chromatogram Analysis
1. **Normal-phase HPLC**:
   - Separates based on polarity.
   - Two peaks from Reaction I (diastereomers) + one peak from Reaction II (meso compound) = **3 peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers and diastereomers.
   - Two peaks from Reaction I (each diastereomer is chiral) + one peak from Reaction II (meso compound) = **3 peaks**.

---

### Final Answer
Both the normal-phase HPLC and the chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.
