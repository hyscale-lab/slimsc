Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So I need to check each compound to see if it has any chiral centers or if it's a meso compound or something like that.

The question lists seven compounds, and I have to count how many are optically active. Let's go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, that's a butene with substituents. Let me draw the structure. So it's CH2=CH-C(Cl)-CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon of a double bond. So it's Cl-C=CH-CH2-CH3? Hmm, wait, wait, but wait. The double bond is from C1 to C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group.

Now, does this have any chirality? Well, a double bond can have E/Z isomerism, but that's not about chirality. For a molecule to have a chiral center, the carbon must be attached to four different groups. Looking at C1: it's attached to Cl, a double bond (so that's two substituents), and two other groups? Wait, wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other groups. Let me see: C1 is connected to Cl, the double bond to C2, and two Hs maybe?

Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's see: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two Hs? So the substituents on C1 are Cl, two Hs, and the double bond (which is a group). Wait, but in terms of substituents: the four groups would be Cl, H, H, and the rest being the double bond. Oh, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2; so the groups attached to C1 are Cl, two Hs, and the C2 (which is CH(CH3)-something). Wait, but does that make four different groups? No, because two Hs are same. So C1 isn't a chiral center. So no optical activity here. Because even if it's Z or E, that's not about chirality. So this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, unless... is there another possibility? Like, maybe a ring or some other structure, but no. This is a simple alkene. So 1 is not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. Hexahydro suggests a ring with six carbons, but with substituents. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-C= attached as a substituent. E geometry.

Wait, but methanoisobenzofuran... that's a bridged bicyclic structure. So the molecule has a bridge, and the substituents at specific positions. The substituents are at 3aR and 7aS, which are stereocenters. Since they have different configurations (R and S), that suggests that the molecule might be chiral.

Additionally, the E configuration on the chloromethylene groupâ€”does that affect chirality? Well, if the substituents on the double bond are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. But given the bicyclic structure, it's possible that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So this molecule probably has chirality. So it's optically active. So that's one.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Now, 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but the configuration is R and S on adjacent carbons.

Wait, so the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH.

Are there any chiral centers here? Each of the CH(CH3) groups is attached to two CH2 groups? No, wait: the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3: so each of those carbons has two CH3 groups? Wait, no, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, each of the 2 and 3 carbons is CH(CH3), but each has two other substituents: the adjacent carbons (CH(CH3) is attached to which groups? Let's see. The 2nd carbon: attached to the two COOH groups? No, wait. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the 2 and 3 carbons are each CH2. Adding methyl groups, so 2 and 3 become CH(CH3).

So for each of those carbons, what are the substituents? 

Carbon 2: attached to one COOH group (on C1), two CH3 groups (since it's CH(CH3)), and the adjacent CH(CH3) on C3.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The structure is:

HOOC - C(CH3)(something) - C(CH3)(something) - COOH.

So each of the 2 and 3 carbons has:

At C2: two CH3 groups, a COOH group from C1, and the C3 (which is CH(CH3)).

So wait, substituents on C2 are: CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). 

Wait, that's two CH3, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). So two substituents are the same (CH3), so can't be a chiral center. Because four substituents must be different for a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the central two carbons are each CH(CH3). Each of these has three substituents: two CH3 and one CH2 group, no. Wait, no. Wait, the entire molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- C1: which is a COOH group (like, the substituent is COOH-CH(CH3)-...)

Wait, no, more accurately, each of C2 and C3 is connected to:

For C2: groups are CH3, CH3, -COOH (from C1), and -CH(CH3)-COOH (from C3). Wait, that's four groups.

Wait, what are the four substituents on C2? 

- One COOH group (from C1? No, wait, the first COOH is on C1, which is the carbon next to C2. So C2 is attached to:

- two CH3 groups (because it's CH(CH3)),

- the C1 (which is a COOH group),

- and the C3 (which is another CH(CH3)).

Wait, so the four groups are: CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3)COOH? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing the structure.

Wait, the full structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- two CH3 groups,

- one COOH group on either end (but wait, C2 is attached to C1, which is a COOH. C3 is attached to C4, which is a COOH. So the groups on C2 are: CH3, CH3, HOOC, and the next carbon (C3). Similarly, C3 has CH3, CH3, COOH, and C2.

Wait, so the substituents on C2 and C3 are: two methyl groups, a carboxylic acid group, and another CH(CH3). So, for C2, substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. CH3,

3. COOH (from C1),

4. CH(CH3) (from C3).

So C2 has two CH3 groups; that means two substituents are the same. So it's not a chiral center. Same for C3. So both C2 and C3 have two CH3 groups; so no chiral centers. So this compound is not chiral, right?

Wait, but the compound is (2R,3S). If there are no chiral centers, how can there be R and S configurations? So this suggests that perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, let's think. If the molecule has two stereocenters, and each has opposite configurations, but the molecule is symmetrical enough, it's a meso compound, which is achiral.

So in this case, the molecule is (2R,3S). Are the two stereocenters related by a plane of symmetry?

Yes. Because if you look at the molecule, the two central carbons mirror each other. So if C2 is R, then C3 would be S if they're symmetric. So the whole molecule would be achiral (meso). So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but if the groups are arranged symmetrically, then yes, it's a meso compound. So no optical activity. So this is not an optically active compound.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The two stereocenters are on adjacent carbons. If the substituents are arranged so that they mirror each other, then it's a meso compound. So yes, like tartaric acid. So this would be a meso compound. So no optical activity for this compound.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Same structure as the previous one, but both substituents are R. So the configurations are same on both stereocenters.

So again, same structure as 3 but both R. Let me see if this is a meso compound or not. The molecule would have two stereocenters. If the configurations are the same, maybe the molecule is chiral.

Wait, if the two stereocenters have the same configuration, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. Because if it's (2R,3R), then the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral.

Wait, let me think. In the previous case, (2R,3S), the molecule is meso. But if both are R or both are S, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, no, wait. Let me take an example. For 2,3-dimethylbutane-1,4-diol, which is similar to this. If the configurations are both R, then the molecule is chiral. Because flipping it would not produce the same structure. So in this case, (2R,3R), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral. So this compound has optical activity.

So compound 4 is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
So this is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1. The configuration is R.

Wait, for a ring to have a chiral center, that carbon must have four different substituents.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the ring? Wait, let's think about the structure.

Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So 3-en means the double bond is between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring, with the OH on C1. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups attached to adjacent carbons (since it's a ring, each carbon attached to the next),

- and the double bond? No, wait, the double bond is on C3 and C4, so C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- C2 (which is CH2),

- C6 (which is CH2),

- and the ring (but I think that's not a substituent, the ring is part of the structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's imagine the cyclohexene ring. C1 has the OH, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and so on.

So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and another CH group. Wait, no, perhaps in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. So substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,

- CH2 (connected to C2),

- CH2 (connected to C6),

- and the double bond? Wait, no, the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are OH, three CH2 groups? No, that's impossible because each carbon in a cyclohexane ring has two CH2 groups attached (except in substituted cases). Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring is not fully saturated.

Wait, perhaps C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups from the ring (like from C2 and C6), and a CH2 group that's part of the double bond? Hmm, no, that's conflicting. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is such that C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a bridge or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, which would have the OH on C1, and the double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a CH group? No, in a cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring. So each ring carbon is connected via single bonds to two other ring carbons, except for the double bond.

So for C1 in cyclohexene: connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds, and has the OH group. So the substituents on C1 are OH, C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is CH2), and perhaps the ring itself. Wait, no, the substituents are the groups attached to the carbon. So in this case, C1 is attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),

- and the ring (but that's more like a structural component, not a substituent per se).

Wait, but in reality, each substituent is a group. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the ring),

- and the double bond? No, the double bond is elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine. Each carbon in a cyclohexene ring is part of the six-membered ring, connected to two other carbons. So for C1: connected to C2, C6, and has the OH group. So the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH2 (from C6),

- and the ring (but that's a cyclohexene ring, so perhaps that's a substituent as well? Not sure.

Wait, actually, the substituents on a carbon are the groups attached to it, excluding the bonds to other carbons in the same molecule. So for C1, the substituents would be OH, and the other two bonds are to C2 and C6. So substituents are OH, CH2CH2 (but that's not right), or maybe two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a hydrogen? No, because the cyclohexene would have all single bonds except for the double bond, so maybe the structure is more like that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether C1 can be a chiral center. For that, it must have four different substituents. So what are the substituents on C1?

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),

- and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ring is such that C1 is connected to C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is also CH2), and has the OH and a hydrogen? No, wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and two hydrogens. So in cyclohexene, some carbons are double-bonded and have fewer hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps I should think of cyclohexene as a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

C1-OH, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 and C3. C3 is connected to C2 and C4, with a double bond between C3 and C4. C4 is connected to C3 and C5, and so on.

So for C1, substituents are:

- OH,

- C2 (which is connected to C3, so perhaps a CH2 group),

- C6 (which is connected to C5, perhaps another CH2),

- and maybe a hydrogen? No, because in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two others, so C1 has two ring bonds and one OH. That leaves one more bond, which is a hydrogen. So substituents are: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and H.

Wait, that would make four different substituents: OH, CH2CH2... no, wait. Because C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups. So substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- CH2 (to C2),

- CH2 (to C6),

- H.

So two of the substituents are the same (CH2 groups). So C1 has two substituents that are identical, meaning it can't be a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it's not optically active. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the question states (R) configuration for it. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the configuration is R, but if there's no chiral center, that's impossible. So maybe I made a mistake in assuming the substituents. Let me try again.

Wait, C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? So substituents are: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and H. So two CH2 groups, so two substituents are same. That means C1 isn't a chiral center. So the molecule isn't chiral. So this compound isn't optically active.

Wait, but the question states (R) configuration. So that suggests that maybe C1 is a chiral center. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a substituent.

Wait, perhaps in the cyclohexene ring, the double bond causes some substituents to be different. Let's see. If the ring is in a certain conformation, perhaps the substituents on C1 are different.

Wait, maybe the ring isn't flat, and the double bond makes the substituents on C1 different. So in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring is not planar. So the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,

- a CH2 group (C2),

- another CH2 group (C6),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but if the molecule has a double bond, perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are different.

Wait, perhaps the C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, so C2 has a different substituent than C6. For example, C2 might be CH2CH2, while C6 is CH2CH2 as well. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that C1 has four different groups. Let me think, maybe the ring's geometry (cis or trans) affects the substituents on C1. But I'm getting stuck. I think I need to think about this differently.

Wait, another approach: how many stereocenters does this compound have?

If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then it must have a chiral center. So, perhaps I was wrong about the substituents.

Wait, perhaps C1 has substituents: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH (from C6), and H. So four different groups. So that would make it a chiral center.

Wait, but how? C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond. So maybe the substituents on C2 and C6 are different. For example, C2 is CH2, but C6 is CH because of the double bond? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond causes some of the substituents to be different. For example, the substituent from C2 might be a CH2 group connected to a CH2 group, whereas the substituent from C6 is a CH2 connected to a CH with a double bond. So maybe substituents on C1 are: OH, CH2-CH2, CH2-CH (double bond), and H.

Wait, in that case, substituents are: OH, two different CH2 groups, and H. So four different substituents. So C1 would be a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.

So perhaps I was wrong earlier, and this compound is chiral. So that would mean it's optically active. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene ring's substituents make C1 a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. If the compound is (R)-configured, then it must have a chiral center, which must have four different substituents. So this must be the case.

So I'll go with this compound being optically active. So that's another one.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
So this is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All are s configuration.

Are there any chiral centers here? Each of those carbons (1,3,5) has four substituents.

Let me think about C1: substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. For a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring and two hydrogens.

Wait, but in this case, C1 has an OH group. So substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- C2 (CH2),

- C6 (CH2),

- and H.

So substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. So two substituents are same (CH2 groups), so not a chiral center. Same for C3 and C5.

So each of the OH-bearing carbons has two CH2 groups as substituents. So no chiral centers. So the molecule is not chiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. If all three OHs are in a symmetric arrangement, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), which could be a symmetrical arrangement.

Wait, cyclohexane is a symmetric structure. If the OHs are on every other carbon (1,3,5), the molecule is symmetric. So it's a meso compound? Or perhaps it's not chiral at all.

In any case, each OH-bearing carbon has two CH2 groups, so no chiral centers. So no optical activity for this compound.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
Structure: The ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but with substituents.

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, the structure is butan-1-one: that's (R)-C=O group on C1, with three more carbons.

So butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-C=O.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, perhaps it's O=C connected to a cyclopentyl and a CH2 group. So the structure is:

O=C-R, where R is a 3-methylbutyl group attached to cyclopentyl.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as (cyclopentyl)(methyl)propan-2-one? No, butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But with substituents on C1 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, and a methyl group on C3.

But for a ketone, the carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, not sure, but perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon as the ketone.

Wait, regardless, the substituents would be:

On C1: the carbonyl group (O=C-), and perhaps other substituents.

Wait, but let's think about whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

The carbonyl is on C1, which has:

- O=C,

- three substituents: perhaps a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, and another substituent.

Wait, no, the structure is butan-1-one, so the carbonyl is on C1. So C1 has:

- O=C-,

- a cyclopentyl group,

- a methyl group,

Wait, but butan-1-one has four carbons. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-CO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the C1, and a methyl on C3.

So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Hmm, not sure.

But regardless, the key is whether any carbon has four different substituents.

Looking for chiral centers. Let's examine each carbon:

C1: carbonyl group. So no, can't be a chiral center.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3, and two Hs? So substituents are O=C-CH2-..., C3, H, H. So two Hs, so no chiral center.

C3: connected to C2, C4, methyl group, and perhaps another substituent. If C3 has a methyl, then substituents would be: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and another group. Wait, but if it's 3-methyl, then substituents are:

From C3: CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and another CH2 (from cyclopentyl). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has four different substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, butan-1-one has four carbons in total. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? But that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, butan-1-one has four carbons, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with substituents.

Wait, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? But that would be longer than four carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a cyclopentyl. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so perhaps the substituents are on the right carbons.

In any case, the substituents on C3 (which is CH(CH3)) would be:

- CH2 from C2,

- CH2 from C4,

- methyl,

- and maybe another group.

Wait, if C3 is CH(CH3), then substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH2 (from C4),

- methyl,

- and maybe a hydrogen?

Wait, no, because it's CH(CH3), which has three substituents: two CH2 and one methyl. Wait, but that's only three, so the fourth substituent would be the hydrogen. So substituents are CH2, CH2, methyl, and H. So two substituents are CH2, which are same. So no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe the carbonyl is on C1, and the substituents on C1 are a cyclopentyl and a methyl, making C1 a chiral center.

Wait, no, because for a ketone, the carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons (the R groups). So in butan-1-one, C1 is the carbonyl, with two substituents: perhaps one is methyl, the other is cyclopentyl. Wait, no, butan-1-one is R-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups. If R is cyclopentyl and R' is a methyl, then the structure would be O=C-(cyclopentyl)(methyl).

Wait, but that's not possible because butan-1-one is four carbons, so:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's pentan-1-one, not butan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the nomenclature.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CHâ‚‚)â‚ƒCO, which is four carbons in total. So the structure is:

O=C-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-.

Wait, no, that's five carbons. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Let's assume that the substituents are arranged such that one of the carbons has four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it's a meso compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because any potential chiral center is a meso form.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl group's substituents are symmetric. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. 

But given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but then why is the compound listed as such? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbons in the side chain is a chiral center.

Wait, let me think. The substituents on C3 are: perhaps a methyl group, a CH2 group, another CH2 group, and a cyclopentyl. So if that's the case, substituents are methyl, two CH2 groups, and cyclopentyl. So two substituents are same (CH2), so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are all different. If the substituents on C3 are: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and cyclopentyl, then four different groups, making it a chiral center. So then, this compound would be optically active.

But wait, the structure is butan-1-one, which is four carbons. So the substituents on C3 would be:

- C2 (CH2),

- C4 (CH2),

- methyl,

- and perhaps another substituent, but in this case, butan-1-one has four carbons, so perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, that would be five carbons.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this. I think perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

So, let's tally up:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes.

3. (2R,3S)-...: No.

4. (2R,3R)-...: Yes.

5. (R)-...: Yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-...: No.

7. 1-cyclopentyl...: Not sure, but perhaps No.

Wait, earlier I thought 5 was yes, but I'm not confident. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. I'm unsure whether C1 has four different substituents. If it does, then it's chiral. But given that the question labels it as R, I must assume it's a chiral center. So yes, that's another.

But wait, earlier I thought 5 isn't, but the (R) configuration implies it is. So I think I should count that as yes.

So, let's recount:

2: yes.

4: yes.

5: yes.

Additionally, I have to reevaluate compound 7. If it has a chiral center, that's another yes.

So, let's try to decide on 7.

Another approach: any tertiary carbon with four different substituents.

If the side chain has a tertiary carbon with four different groups, then yes.

In 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the carbon adjacent to the ketone (C2) has substituents:

- C1 (carbonyl),

- CH(CH3),

- CH2,

- and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the carbon next to the carbonyl is a CH2 group, which can't be a chiral center. The next carbon (C3) has substituents:

- C2 (CH2),

- C4 (CH2),

- methyl,

- and perhaps cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is on C1. So C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and perhaps a hydrogen? So substituents are CH2, CH2, methyl, H. So two CH2, so no.

Hmm, perhaps no chiral centers. So 7 isn't optically active.

So, the count so far:

2: yes.

4: yes.

5: yes.

So that's three. What about the others?

Wait, I had 2: yes (bicyclic), 4: yes (meso? No, wait, 4 is (2R,3R), which would be a chiral center. So that's correct.

5: yes.

So 3 compounds so far.

Wait, but earlier I thought 2,4,5 are yes, which is three. But looking back, I had 2,4,5, and perhaps one more.

Wait, what about the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.

3: (2R,3S): no.

6: no.

7: no.

So total of three optically active compounds.

Wait, but wait: the fifth compound, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, I'm still not 100% sure. Maybe it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are different:

Wait, C1 has OH, two different CH2 groups (if the ring's substituents are arranged asymmetrically), and a hydrogen.

If the two CH2 groups are different because of the ring's double bond, then C1 would have four different substituents. For example, C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, so C2's substituent is different from C6's substituent.

In that case, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, CH2-CR2 (double bond), CH2-CR1 (single bond), and H.

So if that's the case, then C1 is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.

Therefore, I think compound 5 is optically active.

So, the count is:

2: yes.

4: yes.

5: yes.

Additionally, what about others?

Wait, any others?

Looking back at the list:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

So that's three compounds: 2,4,5.

Wait, but the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the answer would be B)3.

Wait, but wait, I'm missing something. Let me check the structures again.

Wait, for the second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This is a bicyclic structure. Is it possible that the substituents lead to a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral despite having R and S centers?

Wait, the substituents are in different positions, so perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So yes, it's optically active.

Wait, but what about the fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

As I thought earlier, because the molecule isn't symmetric, it's chiral. So yes.

So that brings the count to three.

So the answer should be three, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or if it is a meso compound with multiple stereocenters that lacks a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This is a simple alkene. The carbon atoms in the molecule do not have four different substituents, and the double bond does not introduce chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a bicyclic structure with stereocenters at 3a and 7a. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of substituents, making it chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on these carbons are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule a meso compound (achiral).  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, but the configurations at C2 and C3 are the same (both R). This lack of symmetry means the molecule is chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1, along with the substituents on the cyclohexene ring, creates four different groups on C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring. None of the carbons have four different substituents, so there are no chiral centers.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl group on C1 is not a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, and there is no evidence of chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (2)  
- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (4)  
- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (5)  

Thus, **3 compounds are optically active**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So I need to check each compound to see if it has any chiral centers or if it's a meso compound or something like that.

The question lists seven compounds, and I have to count how many are optically active. Let's go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, that's a butene with substituents. Let me draw the structure. So it's CH2=CH-C(Cl)-CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon of a double bond. So it's Cl-C=CH-CH2-CH3? Hmm, wait, wait, but wait. The double bond is from C1 to C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group.

Now, does this have any chirality? Well, a double bond can have E/Z isomerism, but that's not about chirality. For a molecule to have a chiral center, the carbon must be attached to four different groups. Looking at C1: it's attached to Cl, a double bond (so that's two substituents), and two other groups? Wait, wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other groups. Let me see: C1 is connected to Cl, the double bond to C2, and two Hs maybe?

Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's see: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two Hs? So the substituents on C1 are Cl, two Hs, and the double bond (which is a group). Wait, but in terms of substituents: the four groups would be Cl, H, H, and the rest being the double bond. Oh, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2; so the groups attached to C1 are Cl, two Hs, and the C2 (which is CH(CH3)-something). Wait, but does that make four different groups? No, because two Hs are same. So C1 isn't a chiral center. So no optical activity here. Because even if it's Z or E, that's not about chirality. So this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, unless... is there another possibility? Like, maybe a ring or some other structure, but no. This is a simple alkene. So 1 is not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. Hexahydro suggests a ring with six carbons, but with substituents. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-C= attached as a substituent. E geometry.

Wait, but methanoisobenzofuran... that's a bridged bicyclic structure. So the molecule has a bridge, and the substituents at specific positions. The substituents are at 3aR and 7aS, which are stereocenters. Since they have different configurations (R and S), that suggests that the molecule might be chiral.

Additionally, the E configuration on the chloromethylene groupâ€”does that affect chirality? Well, if the substituents on the double bond are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. But given the bicyclic structure, it's possible that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So this molecule probably has chirality. So it's optically active. So that's one.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Now, 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but the configuration is R and S on adjacent carbons.

Wait, so the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH.

Are there any chiral centers here? Each of the CH(CH3) groups is attached to two CH2 groups? No, wait: the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3: so each of those carbons has two CH3 groups? Wait, no, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, each of the 2 and 3 carbons is CH(CH3), but each has two other substituents: the adjacent carbons (CH(CH3) is attached to which groups? Let's see. The 2nd carbon: attached to the two COOH groups? No, wait. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the 2 and 3 carbons are each CH2. Adding methyl groups, so 2 and 3 become CH(CH3).

So for each of those carbons, what are the substituents? 

Carbon 2: attached to one COOH group (on C1), two CH3 groups (since it's CH(CH3)), and the adjacent CH(CH3) on C3.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The structure is:

HOOC - C(CH3)(something) - C(CH3)(something) - COOH.

So each of the 2 and 3 carbons has:

At C2: two CH3 groups, a COOH group from C1, and the C3 (which is CH(CH3)).

So wait, substituents on C2 are: CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). 

Wait, that's two CH3, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). So two substituents are the same (CH3), so can't be a chiral center. Because four substituents must be different for a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the central two carbons are each CH(CH3). Each of these has three substituents: two CH3 and one CH2 group, no. Wait, no. Wait, the entire molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- C1: which is a COOH group (like, the substituent is COOH-CH(CH3)-...)

Wait, no, more accurately, each of C2 and C3 is connected to:

For C2: groups are CH3, CH3, -COOH (from C1), and -CH(CH3)-COOH (from C3). Wait, that's four groups.

Wait, what are the four substituents on C2? 

- One COOH group (from C1? No, wait, the first COOH is on C1, which is the carbon next to C2. So C2 is attached to:

- two CH3 groups (because it's CH(CH3)),

- the C1 (which is a COOH group),

- and the C3 (which is another CH(CH3)).

Wait, so the four groups are: CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3)COOH? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing the structure.

Wait, the full structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- two CH3 groups,

- one COOH group on either end (but wait, C2 is attached to C1, which is a COOH. C3 is attached to C4, which is a COOH. So the groups on C2 are: CH3, CH3, HOOC, and the next carbon (C3). Similarly, C3 has CH3, CH3, COOH, and C2.

Wait, so the substituents on C2 and C3 are: two methyl groups, a carboxylic acid group, and another CH(CH3). So, for C2, substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. CH3,

3. COOH (from C1),

4. CH(CH3) (from C3).

So C2 has two CH3 groups; that means two substituents are the same. So it's not a chiral center. Same for C3. So both C2 and C3 have two CH3 groups; so no chiral centers. So this compound is not chiral, right?

Wait, but the compound is (2R,3S). If there are no chiral centers, how can there be R and S configurations? So this suggests that perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, let's think. If the molecule has two stereocenters, and each has opposite configurations, but the molecule is symmetrical enough, it's a meso compound, which is achiral.

So in this case, the molecule is (2R,3S). Are the two stereocenters related by a plane of symmetry?

Yes. Because if you look at the molecule, the two central carbons mirror each other. So if C2 is R, then C3 would be S if they're symmetric. So the whole molecule would be achiral (meso). So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but if the groups are arranged symmetrically, then yes, it's a meso compound. So no optical activity. So this is not an optically active compound.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The two stereocenters are on adjacent carbons. If the substituents are arranged so that they mirror each other, then it's a meso compound. So yes, like tartaric acid. So this would be a meso compound. So no optical activity for this compound.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Same structure as the previous one, but both substituents are R. So the configurations are same on both stereocenters.

So again, same structure as 3 but both R. Let me see if this is a meso compound or not. The molecule would have two stereocenters. If the configurations are the same, maybe the molecule is chiral.

Wait, if the two stereocenters have the same configuration, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. Because if it's (2R,3R), then the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral.

Wait, let me think. In the previous case, (2R,3S), the molecule is meso. But if both are R or both are S, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, no, wait. Let me take an example. For 2,3-dimethylbutane-1,4-diol, which is similar to this. If the configurations are both R, then the molecule is chiral. Because flipping it would not produce the same structure. So in this case, (2R,3R), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral. So this compound has optical activity.

So compound 4 is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
So this is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1. The configuration is R.

Wait, for a ring to have a chiral center, that carbon must have four different substituents.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the ring? Wait, let's think about the structure.

Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So 3-en means the double bond is between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring, with the OH on C1. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups attached to adjacent carbons (since it's a ring, each carbon attached to the next),

- and the double bond? No, wait, the double bond is on C3 and C4, so C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- C2 (which is CH2),

- C6 (which is CH2),

- and the ring (but I think that's not a substituent, the ring is part of the structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's imagine the cyclohexene ring. C1 has the OH, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and so on.

So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and another CH group. Wait, no, perhaps in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. So substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,

- CH2 (connected to C2),

- CH2 (connected to C6),

- and the double bond? Wait, no, the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are OH, three CH2 groups? No, that's impossible because each carbon in a cyclohexane ring has two CH2 groups attached (except in substituted cases). Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring is not fully saturated.

Wait, perhaps C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups from the ring (like from C2 and C6), and a CH2 group that's part of the double bond? Hmm, no, that's conflicting. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is such that C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a bridge or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, which would have the OH on C1, and the double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a CH group? No, in a cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring. So each ring carbon is connected via single bonds to two other ring carbons, except for the double bond.

So for C1 in cyclohexene: connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds, and has the OH group. So the substituents on C1 are OH, C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is CH2), and perhaps the ring itself. Wait, no, the substituents are the groups attached to the carbon. So in this case, C1 is attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),

- and the ring (but that's more like a structural component, not a substituent per se).

Wait, but in reality, each substituent is a group. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the ring),

- and the double bond? No, the double bond is elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine. Each carbon in a cyclohexene ring is part of the six-membered ring, connected to two other carbons. So for C1: connected to C2, C6, and has the OH group. So the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH2 (from C6),

- and the ring (but that's a cyclohexene ring, so perhaps that's a substituent as well? Not sure.

Wait, actually, the substituents on a carbon are the groups attached to it, excluding the bonds to other carbons in the same molecule. So for C1, the substituents would be OH, and the other two bonds are to C2 and C6. So substituents are OH, CH2CH2 (but that's not right), or maybe two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a hydrogen? No, because the cyclohexene would have all single bonds except for the double bond, so maybe the structure is more like that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether C1 can be a chiral center. For that, it must have four different substituents. So what are the substituents on C1?

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),

- and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ring is such that C1 is connected to C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is also CH2), and has the OH and a hydrogen? No, wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and two hydrogens. So in cyclohexene, some carbons are double-bonded and have fewer hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps I should think of cyclohexene as a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

C1-OH, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 and C3. C3 is connected to C2 and C4, with a double bond between C3 and C4. C4 is connected to C3 and C5, and so on.

So for C1, substituents are:

- OH,

- C2 (which is connected to C3, so perhaps a CH2 group),

- C6 (which is connected to C5, perhaps another CH2),

- and maybe a hydrogen? No, because in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two others, so C1 has two ring bonds and one OH. That leaves one more bond, which is a hydrogen. So substituents are: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and H.

Wait, that would make four different substituents: OH, CH2CH2... no, wait. Because C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups. So substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- CH2 (to C2),

- CH2 (to C6),

- H.

So two of the substituents are the same (CH2 groups). So C1 has two substituents that are identical, meaning it can't be a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it's not optically active. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the question states (R) configuration for it. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the configuration is R, but if there's no chiral center, that's impossible. So maybe I made a mistake in assuming the substituents. Let me try again.

Wait, C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? So substituents are: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and H. So two CH2 groups, so two substituents are same. That means C1 isn't a chiral center. So the molecule isn't chiral. So this compound isn't optically active.

Wait, but the question states (R) configuration. So that suggests that maybe C1 is a chiral center. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a substituent.

Wait, perhaps in the cyclohexene ring, the double bond causes some substituents to be different. Let's see. If the ring is in a certain conformation, perhaps the substituents on C1 are different.

Wait, maybe the ring isn't flat, and the double bond makes the substituents on C1 different. So in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring is not planar. So the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,

- a CH2 group (C2),

- another CH2 group (C6),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but if the molecule has a double bond, perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are different.

Wait, perhaps the C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, so C2 has a different substituent than C6. For example, C2 might be CH2CH2, while C6 is CH2CH2 as well. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that C1 has four different groups. Let me think, maybe the ring's geometry (cis or trans) affects the substituents on C1. But I'm getting stuck. I think I need to think about this differently.

Wait, another approach: how many stereocenters does this compound have?

If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then it must have a chiral center. So, perhaps I was wrong about the substituents.

Wait, perhaps C1 has substituents: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH (from C6), and H. So four different groups. So that would make it a chiral center.

Wait, but how? C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond. So maybe the substituents on C2 and C6 are different. For example, C2 is CH2, but C6 is CH because of the double bond? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond causes some of the substituents to be different. For example, the substituent from C2 might be a CH2 group connected to a CH2 group, whereas the substituent from C6 is a CH2 connected to a CH with a double bond. So maybe substituents on C1 are: OH, CH2-CH2, CH2-CH (double bond), and H.

Wait, in that case, substituents are: OH, two different CH2 groups, and H. So four different substituents. So C1 would be a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.

So perhaps I was wrong earlier, and this compound is chiral. So that would mean it's optically active. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene ring's substituents make C1 a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. If the compound is (R)-configured, then it must have a chiral center, which must have four different substituents. So this must be the case.

So I'll go with this compound being optically active. So that's another one.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
So this is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All are s configuration.

Are there any chiral centers here? Each of those carbons (1,3,5) has four substituents.

Let me think about C1: substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. For a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring and two hydrogens.

Wait, but in this case, C1 has an OH group. So substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- C2 (CH2),

- C6 (CH2),

- and H.

So substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. So two substituents are same (CH2 groups), so not a chiral center. Same for C3 and C5.

So each of the OH-bearing carbons has two CH2 groups as substituents. So no chiral centers. So the molecule is not chiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. If all three OHs are in a symmetric arrangement, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), which could be a symmetrical arrangement.

Wait, cyclohexane is a symmetric structure. If the OHs are on every other carbon (1,3,5), the molecule is symmetric. So it's a meso compound? Or perhaps it's not chiral at all.

In any case, each OH-bearing carbon has two CH2 groups, so no chiral centers. So no optical activity for this compound.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
Structure: The ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but with substituents.

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, the structure is butan-1-one: that's (R)-C=O group on C1, with three more carbons.

So butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-C=O.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, but in this case, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, perhaps it's O=C connected to a cyclopentyl and a CH2 group. So the structure is:

O=C-R, where R is a 3-methylbutyl group attached to cyclopentyl.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as (cyclopentyl)(methyl)propan-2-one? No, butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But with substituents on C1 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, and a methyl group on C3.

But for a ketone, the carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, not sure, but perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon as the ketone.

Wait, regardless, the substituents would be:

On C1: the carbonyl group (O=C-), and perhaps other substituents.

Wait, but let's think about whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

The carbonyl is on C1, which has:

- O=C,

- three substituents: perhaps a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, and another substituent.

Wait, no, the structure is butan-1-one, so the carbonyl is on C1. So C1 has:

- O=C-,

- a cyclopentyl group,

- a methyl group,

Wait, but butan-1-one has four carbons. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-CO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the C1, and a methyl on C3.

So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? Hmm, not sure.

But regardless, the key is whether any carbon has four different substituents.

Looking for chiral centers. Let's examine each carbon:

C1: carbonyl group. So no, can't be a chiral center.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3, and two Hs? So substituents are O=C-CH2-..., C3, H, H. So two Hs, so no chiral center.

C3: connected to C2, C4, methyl group, and perhaps another substituent. If C3 has a methyl, then substituents would be: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and another group. Wait, but if it's 3-methyl, then substituents are:

From C3: CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and another CH2 (from cyclopentyl). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has four different substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, butan-1-one has four carbons in total. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? But that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, butan-1-one has four carbons, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with substituents.

Wait, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? But that would be longer than four carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a cyclopentyl. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so perhaps the substituents are on the right carbons.

In any case, the substituents on C3 (which is CH(CH3)) would be:

- CH2 from C2,

- CH2 from C4,

- methyl,

- and maybe another group.

Wait, if C3 is CH(CH3), then substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2),

- CH2 (from C4),

- methyl,

- and maybe a hydrogen?

Wait, no, because it's CH(CH3), which has three substituents: two CH2 and one methyl. Wait, but that's only three, so the fourth substituent would be the hydrogen. So substituents are CH2, CH2, methyl, and H. So two substituents are CH2, which are same. So no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe the carbonyl is on C1, and the substituents on C1 are a cyclopentyl and a methyl, making C1 a chiral center.

Wait, no, because for a ketone, the carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons (the R groups). So in butan-1-one, C1 is the carbonyl, with two substituents: perhaps one is methyl, the other is cyclopentyl. Wait, no, butan-1-one is R-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups. If R is cyclopentyl and R' is a methyl, then the structure would be O=C-(cyclopentyl)(methyl).

Wait, but that's not possible because butan-1-one is four carbons, so:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's pentan-1-one, not butan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the nomenclature.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CHâ‚‚)â‚ƒCO, which is four carbons in total. So the structure is:

O=C-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-.

Wait, no, that's five carbons. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Let's assume that the substituents are arranged such that one of the carbons has four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it's a meso compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because any potential chiral center is a meso form.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl group's substituents are symmetric. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. 

But given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but then why is the compound listed as such? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbons in the side chain is a chiral center.

Wait, let me think. The substituents on C3 are: perhaps a methyl group, a CH2 group, another CH2 group, and a cyclopentyl. So if that's the case, substituents are methyl, two CH2 groups, and cyclopentyl. So two substituents are same (CH2), so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are all different. If the substituents on C3 are: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and cyclopentyl, then four different groups, making it a chiral center. So then, this compound would be optically active.

But wait, the structure is butan-1-one, which is four carbons. So the substituents on C3 would be:

- C2 (CH2),

- C4 (CH2),

- methyl,

- and perhaps another substituent, but in this case, butan-1-one has four carbons, so perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, that would be five carbons.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this. I think perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

So, let's tally up:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes.

3. (2R,3S)-...: No.

4. (2R,3R)-...: Yes.

5. (R)-...: Yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-...: No.

7. 1-cyclopentyl...: Not sure, but perhaps No.

Wait, earlier I thought 5 was yes, but I'm not confident. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. I'm unsure whether C1 has four different substituents. If it does, then it's chiral. But given that the question labels it as R, I must assume it's a chiral center. So yes, that's another.

But wait, earlier I thought 5 isn't, but the (R) configuration implies it is. So I think I should count that as yes.

So, let's recount:

2: yes.

4: yes.

5: yes.

Additionally, I have to reevaluate compound 7. If it has a chiral center, that's another yes.

So, let's try to decide on 7.

Another approach: any tertiary carbon with four different substituents.

If the side chain has a tertiary carbon with four different groups, then yes.

In 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps the carbon adjacent to the ketone (C2) has substituents:

- C1 (carbonyl),

- CH(CH3),

- CH2,

- and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the carbon next to the carbonyl is a CH2 group, which can't be a chiral center. The next carbon (C3) has substituents:

- C2 (CH2),

- C4 (CH2),

- methyl,

- and perhaps cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is on C1. So C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and perhaps a hydrogen? So substituents are CH2, CH2, methyl, H. So two CH2, so no.

Hmm, perhaps no chiral centers. So 7 isn't optically active.

So, the count so far:

2: yes.

4: yes.

5: yes.

So that's three. What about the others?

Wait, I had 2: yes (bicyclic), 4: yes (meso? No, wait, 4 is (2R,3R), which would be a chiral center. So that's correct.

5: yes.

So 3 compounds so far.

Wait, but earlier I thought 2,4,5 are yes, which is three. But looking back, I had 2,4,5, and perhaps one more.

Wait, what about the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.

3: (2R,3S): no.

6: no.

7: no.

So total of three optically active compounds.

Wait, but wait: the fifth compound, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, I'm still not 100% sure. Maybe it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are different:

Wait, C1 has OH, two different CH2 groups (if the ring's substituents are arranged asymmetrically), and a hydrogen.

If the two CH2 groups are different because of the ring's double bond, then C1 would have four different substituents. For example, C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, so C2's substituent is different from C6's substituent.

In that case, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, CH2-CR2 (double bond), CH2-CR1 (single bond), and H.

So if that's the case, then C1 is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.

Therefore, I think compound 5 is optically active.

So, the count is:

2: yes.

4: yes.

5: yes.

Additionally, what about others?

Wait, any others?

Looking back at the list:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

So that's three compounds: 2,4,5.

Wait, but the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the answer would be B)3.

Wait, but wait, I'm missing something. Let me check the structures again.

Wait, for the second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This is a bicyclic structure. Is it possible that the substituents lead to a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral despite having R and S centers?

Wait, the substituents are in different positions, so perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So yes, it's optically active.

Wait, but what about the fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

As I thought earlier, because the molecule isn't symmetric, it's chiral. So yes.

So that brings the count to three.

So the answer should be three, which is option B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or if it is a meso compound with multiple stereocenters that lacks a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This is a simple alkene. The carbon atoms in the molecule do not have four different substituents, and the double bond does not introduce chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a bicyclic structure with stereocenters at 3a and 7a. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of substituents, making it chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the substituents on these carbons are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule a meso compound (achiral).  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, but the configurations at C2 and C3 are the same (both R). This lack of symmetry means the molecule is chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1, along with the substituents on the cyclohexene ring, creates four different groups on C1. This makes C1 a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring. None of the carbons have four different substituents, so there are no chiral centers.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl group on C1 is not a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, and there is no evidence of chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (2)  
- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (4)  
- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (5)  

Thus, **3 compounds are optically active**.

**Answer: B**
