Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to identify what the starting material is. 1-bromobenzene-2-d—wait, wait, that notation might not be right. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Because sometimes the numbers can get confusing. So the structure would have a bromine at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Let me draw it out mentally. The benzene ring has Br at position 1 (let's say the top), and methyl groups at 2 (next to Br) and 4 (two positions away, across the ring).

Now, the reaction is with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic substitution, though, it's more about deprotonating something.

Wait, but wait—another thing comes to mind: the benzene ring with substituents. Maybe this is about a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts usually involves AlCl3 as a catalyst. Or maybe it's about elimination forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, like in a benzannulation or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene?

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, positions 2 and 4 are both methyl groups, and position 1 is Br. So the ring has Br at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4.

But wait, that would make the structure with Br at one position and methyl groups at the ortho and para positions relative to Br. Hmm.

So when we treat this with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. In aromatic substitution, the reaction might be a dehydrohalogenation, but NaNH2 is usually used for elimination in aliphatic compounds, like forming alkenes from haloalkanes.

Alternatively, in aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 can act as a base to deprotonate something. But where are the acidic protons in this molecule?

The acidity of protons in aromatic compounds can be influenced by substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups like nitro make the ring more deprotonated, but methyl groups are electron-donating, which would make the ring less acidic.

Wait, but the substituents here are methyl groups and a bromine. So, the positions where deprotonation could occur would be where the ring is activated, perhaps. But wait, bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (if it's attached directly, via inductive effect), but in this case, the Br is a substituent on the ring. So in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the substituents are Br at 1, methyl at 2 and 4.

So, looking for acidic hydrogens. In aromatic rings, the alpha hydrogens (those adjacent to substituents) can be more acidic. So, maybe the hydrogens next to the Br or the methyl groups.

But wait, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl group, so maybe the hydrogen at position 6 is adjacent to Br. Similarly, the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, so their adjacent positions are 1, 3, and 5.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about elimination. But wait, if we have a benzene ring, elimination would require a leaving group and adjacent hydrogen. But benzene is a six-membered ring, so maybe it's not about forming a double bond in the ring, but rather adding a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds. Oh wait, perhaps it's about forming a benzyne intermediate, which is a triple bond in the ring.

Ah! Benzyne chemistry. Making a triple bond in the ring. So, if we have a dihalobenzene and eliminate two halides, we can form a triple bond. But in this case, the starting material is a mono-bromobenzene with methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but maybe the base (NaNH2) abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond.

Wait, but the starting molecule is only mono-brominated. Hmm. So, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Another thought: perhaps the methyl groups can be oxidized or something, but I don't think NaNH2 does that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. But with only one Br, how would that work? Because usually, benzyne is prepared from 1,2-dihalobenzenes. For instance, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a triple bond between the two carbons where the Brs were.

But in our case, the starting material is only mono-brominated. So that doesn't fit the benzyne scenario. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the structure is Br at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. So, the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to Br.

Now, treating with NaNH2 in ammonia—so a strong base. Maybe the Br is a leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination.

But wait, in aromatic systems, elimination is a bit different. So, if the hydrogen is abstracted from a position adjacent to Br, perhaps a benzene ring with a double bond would form, but that's not possible because benzene already has maximum conjugation. Alternatively, maybe the ring would expand or contract, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups. Since the ring has methyl groups (activating, electron-donating), but the Br is a meta director. Wait, but in nucleophilic substitution, the ring is usually activated towards attack by a nucleophile, but under strongly basic conditions, perhaps it's more about elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the methyl groups are in positions that allow for some kind of coupling or elimination. Like, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a methyl group? But methyl groups are fairly stable; it's less likely unless there's a good leaving group nearby.

Wait, wait, wait. The molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the Br is at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. Let's number the ring:

Positions:
1: Br
2: CH3
3: H
4: CH3
5: H
6: H

So, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 4. Now, the question is, where can elimination happen?

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen next to the Br. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl group, so no H there. Position 6 is H. So, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the Br at 1 and the H at 6 are eliminated, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but C1 is already bonded to Br and two other carbons (C2 and C6). If we eliminate H from C6 and Br from C1, that would produce a double bond between C1 and C6, but that would require breaking the existing bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about forming a triple bond in the ring.

Wait, maybe it's not about the benzene ring itself but about substituents on it. Since the ring has two methyl groups, perhaps the reaction involves the methyl groups. For example, deprotonation of a methyl group to form a carbanion, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are in positions that allow for some kind of elimination when the base abstracts a proton. Let me think about the structure again. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 (which is adjacent to position 2, which has a methyl group), then maybe it could lead to some kind of elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible products. The question is about how many possible organic products form.

If the reaction is elimination to form a triple bond in the benzene ring, but we only have one Br, that doesn't make sense. So maybe not benzyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But in aromatic substitution, the Br is a leaving group, but you'd need a nucleophile. However, under strongly basic conditions, it's more about elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the methyl groups are involved in some way. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to a methyl anion, but that's not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, removing H and Br to form a double bond on the ring.

Wait, but benzene rings are already highly conjugated. Forming a double bond would require breaking existing conjugation, which isn't favorable. So maybe the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the methyl groups. For example, if a methyl group adjacent to the Br loses a hydrogen, leading to some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a Birch reduction scenario, but Birch usually involves metals like Na or Mg in ammonia, not NaNH2. Plus, Birch reduces aromatic rings to dienes, but the starting material here is already a mono-substituted ring. Hmm.

Another possibility: the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, but in some cases, like in aromatic substitution, perhaps the amide acts as a nucleophile. But in that case, we'd have NH2^- attacking the ring, displacing Br. But aromatic nucleophilic substitution typically requires a strongly activated ring. Our ring has methyl groups, which are activating, but the Br is a meta director. So maybe the substitution is possible, but I'm not sure if NaNH2 would facilitate that.

Wait, but let me think again. If the reaction is a substitution, replacing Br with something. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps the mechanism is different.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But in benzene, the structure is already all double bonds, so that's not feasible. Perhaps the ring doesn't change, but a substituent is formed.

Wait, perhaps the methyl group undergoes some reaction. For example, deprotonation of a methyl group next to another substituent, leading to elimination. But I don't recall methyl groups being easily deprotonated under these conditions. Plus, methyl groups are fairly stable.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is about how many products form. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction leads to elimination, perhaps forming a triple bond in the ring. But as I thought earlier, that requires two leaving groups. Since there's only one Br, that's not possible. So elimination to form a triple bond seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a result of elimination. For example, maybe the methyl groups are involved in some way.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a demethylation. But with NaNH2, I don't think that's the case. Demethylation usually involves acids or other reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the loss of H and Br and forming a double bond. But the ring can't form a double bond because it's already all double bonds. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder type of reaction, but that requires dienes and dienophiles, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups undergo deprotonation, forming carbanions, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could attack another molecule or undergo some rearrangement. But I'm not too familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are oxidized. But NaNH2 is a base, not an oxidizing agent, so probably not.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the reaction is elimination, perhaps the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But C1 is attached to Br and two other carbons. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is eliminated along with a hydrogen from another position, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a Fittig reaction, which involves coupling of aryl halides with sodium. But Fittig usually requires two equivalents of aryl halides and forms a biaryl structure. But in this case, we have only one Br, so perhaps that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling with another molecule. But if that's the case, the product would be a dimer, but I'm not sure how that would work with NaNH2.

Wait, maybe I should look for similar reactions. For example, when a mono-halobenzene is treated with a strong base, what happens? I remember that sometimes, under certain conditions, elimination can form a triple bond if there are adjacent leaving groups. But again, that requires two leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups are ortho and para to the Br. Maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to some elimination. But methyl groups don't have hydrogens adjacent to the ring in a way that would allow for elimination of Br. Or wait, the methyl group is attached to the ring; perhaps a hydrogen on the methyl group is abstracted, leading to a radical or some instability.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's meta to the Br, leading to some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about the ring itself but about substituents on the ring. If the ring has methyl groups, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a methyl group, leading to a carbanion. But carbanions are not very stable, so perhaps they would abstract a proton leading to some elimination.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, that would lead to a carbanion on the ring. But that's not very likely since methyl groups are poor at stabilizing negative charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amine group. But that would require an aromatic nucleophilic substitution. The presence of methyl groups (activating) might facilitate this, but NaNH2 is more of a base.

Wait, in aromatic substitution, for nucleophilic substitution to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Methyl groups are activating, but they are ortho/para directors. However, Br is a deactivating group. So perhaps the ring isn't activated enough for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a elimination leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. But as benzene has maximum conjugation, forming a double bond would require disrupting the aromaticity, which is not favorable.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products. So perhaps there's more than one possible product based on different pathways.

Wait, another possibility is that the Br is eliminated, and the ring undergoes some change. But without a second leaving group, I don't see how that would form a triple bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, replacing Br with an amide group. So, the product would be 1-amidobenzene-2,4-dimethyl. But how many products would that yield?

Wait, but in substitution, the amide would come in. But for aromatic substitution, the incoming nucleophile (NH2^-) would attack the ring. But the positions available are meta to Br. Wait, Br is at position 1, which is the para position from position 3. So the substituents are at 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). So the possible positions for substitution would be at position 3 or 5 or 6? But wait, the ring already has substituents at 1, 2, and 4, so the nucleophile would attack in the remaining positions, which are 3, 5, or 6.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, the incoming group tends to go into the position that's most activated. The methyl groups are activating, so their positions (2 and 4) are already occupied. So the nucleophile would attack at positions that are ortho or para to the methyl groups.

Wait, but in this case, the ring already has substituents, so perhaps the substitution would happen at position 3, 5, or 6. But if the reaction is a substitution, how many possible products would form?

Wait, if the Br is replaced by NH2, then we would have NH2 at position 1, but that's where the Br was. So, the product would be 1-amidobenzene-2,4-dimethyl. Only one product from substitution.

But I'm not sure if the reaction conditions favor substitution. NaNH2 is more of a base than a nucleophile. So maybe substitution isn't the main pathway.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not seeing how that would proceed to form a new product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with an adjacent substituent. But without a leaving group, I don't see elimination happening.

Wait, another angle: the presence of two methyl groups at 2 and 4 could allow for the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a result of the elimination of H and Br from adjacent positions.

Wait, the Br is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at 2 and 4. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1, then elimination of Br would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring already has double bonds; perhaps this would form a triple bond (benzyne). But how?

Wait, to form benzyne, two adjacent substituents (like two Brs) would need to eliminate. But in our case, we have only one Br. So unless another leaving group is present, which it's not, I don't see how benzyne would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about the main ring but about substituents on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups are involved in some elimination. For instance, if a methyl group adjacent to Br loses a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond in the ring. But again, I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about what the possible products could be.

If the reaction leads to substitution, perhaps only one product is formed because the nucleophile can only attack at one position.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps multiple products are possible, depending on where the hydrogen is abstracted.

Wait, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from either position 6 or position 3, leading to different elimination products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (adjacent to Br at 1), elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6. But in benzene, that would disrupt the aromaticity unless it's a triple bond.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes from haloalkanes. But here, we're dealing with an aromatic ring.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction isn't with the ring itself but with the methyl substituents. Could the base abstract a hydrogen from a methyl group, leading to some elimination? For example, if a methyl group loses a hydrogen, becoming a carbanion, which then eliminates to form a double bond.

Wait, but methyl groups don't have beta hydrogens, so elimination wouldn't be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group loses a hydrogen, leading to a radical or something else, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is analogous to the formation of benzynes. Wait, but without a second leaving group, this seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the starting material isn't 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene but something else. Wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is also called bromobenzene with methyl groups at 2 and 4 positions.

So, considering that structure, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of HBr from adjacent positions, but since only one Br is present, that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a coupling. The base could facilitate the formation of a benzene dimer by coupling the aryl bromide with another molecule. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where Br is replaced by an amine group. Then the product would have NH2 at position 1, along with CH3 at 2 and 4. So, only one product.

But the question is about how many products form. So, if substitution occurs, only one product. If elimination occurs, perhaps more products. But without a second leaving group, I can't see how elimination would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the ring but the substituents. For example, the base could deprotonate a methyl group, but as I thought earlier, that's not likely to form a stable product.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a demethylation, but I don't think so. Or perhaps the methyl groups are oxidized to something else. But under basic conditions, that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the base deprotonates a hydrogen that's para to the Br, leading to some kind of ring expansion or other change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the ring structure at all but instead leads to the substitution of Br by something else.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about the options again. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If substitution leads to only one product, then the answer would be B)1.

Alternatively, if elimination leads to more than one product, perhaps multiple positions are possible for elimination. But without a second leaving group, I don't see how that works.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that branches in different ways, leading to multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about the main ring but about the substituents. For example, if the methyl groups undergo elimination, but I don't see how that's possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the loss of H and Br, forming a benzene ring with a new substituent. But without a second leaving group, I don't see how that would form a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is already a fully conjugated ring.

Wait, maybe it's about the steric effects. The methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are bulky, so the base can abstract a hydrogen only from certain positions, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or position 5, leading to different elimination products. But without a second leaving group, elimination isn't possible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group, but considering the substituents, how many positions are possible for substitution.

Wait, the substituent is at position 1, so the possible positions for substitution would be the ones activated by the methyl groups. Methyl groups are activating, so the nucleophile would attack ortho or para to them.

Wait, the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, the positions available for substitution would be positions 3, 5, and 6. But wait, position 1 is already occupied by Br, which is being replaced. So, perhaps substitution occurs at position 3, 5, or 6.

Wait, but the Br is at position 1, which is adjacent to position 2 (CH3) and position 6. So, when Br leaves, the nucleophile (NH2^-) would attack the ring. The positions available are 3, 5, and 6.

Wait, but the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, which are ortho to position 1. So, the nucleophile would attack the positions that are most activated, which are ortho and para to the methyl groups.

But position 1 is a bromine, which is a meta director. So, the nucleophile would attack at positions that are ortho and para to the methyl groups, but considering the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the available positions for substitution are position 3, 5, and 6, but with the existing substituents, not all positions are available.

Wait, in the molecule, positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied. So, the possible positions for substitution are 3, 5, and 6.

But the methyl groups are at 2 and 4. So, the nucleophile would attack, say, position 3 (which is meta to position 1 and ortho to position 2), or position 5 (meta to position 1 and ortho to position 4), or position 6 (para to position 2 and meta to position 4).

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 2 (CH3). So, perhaps the nucleophile could attack at position 3, 5, or 6.

But in substitution reactions, the incoming group tends to attack the most activated positions. The methyl groups are activating, so the positions ortho to them (positions 1,3,5 for methyl at 2; positions 1,3,5 for methyl at 4) would be activated.

But position 1 is already occupied by Br, so the available positions are 3 and 5 from the methyl at 2, and 3 and 5 from the methyl at 4. But position 3 is common to both.

Wait, so the possible attack positions would be 3, 5, and 6.

But in this case, position 6 is also adjacent to Br, which is deactivating. So, perhaps position 6 is less favored for substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs at position 6, which is adjacent to the Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to only one possible product because of the symmetry of the molecule.

Wait, the molecule has a Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So, the molecule is symmetric across the axis passing through position 1 and the center. So, positions 3 and 5 are symmetric, and position 6 is unique.

So, if substitution occurs, the nucleophile can attack either position 3 or 5, which are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. So, that would lead to only one unique product.

Additionally, attack at position 6 would be another product, but position 6 is adjacent to Br, which is deactivating, making it less likely for substitution.

So, substitution at position 3 (same as 5) and position 6 would be possible. But if substitution only occurs at position 3 (and 5, which is the same due to symmetry), that would be one product.

Wait, but if substitution occurs at position 6, that would be another product.

Wait, but considering the molecule's symmetry, if substitution occurs at position 3, it's the same as position 5, so that's one product. But substitution at position 6 would be a different product.

So, that would lead to two possible products: one where substitution is at position 3 (or 5, which is the same), and another at position 6.

So, the number of products would be two.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution doesn't occur, and elimination is the main pathway, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, but under strong basic conditions, substitution might not happen as readily as elimination. So maybe elimination is the main pathway.

But earlier, I thought that elimination requires two leaving groups, which we don't have here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the loss of H and Br, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But that's not possible because benzene is already fully conjugated.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a rearrangement of substituents. But I can't think of any such rearrangement under these conditions.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a coupling, leading to a dimer. But without a second aryl halide, I don't see how that would happen.

Another thought: perhaps the methyl groups are oxidized to something else, but I don't think NaNH2 does that.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products.

If substitution leads to two products (positions 3 and 6), then the answer would be C)2.

But wait, considering the molecule's symmetry, substitution at positions 3 and 5 would be the same product, so that's one product. Substitution at position 6 would be another, making two products.

So, the number of possible products would be 2.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if substitution leads to only one product, perhaps due to steric or electronic factors favoring attack at one position, then the answer would be B)1.

But considering the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, the attack at position 3 (ortho to methyl at 2) and position 5 (ortho to methyl at 4) would both be favorable. But due to symmetry, they'd result in the same product.

So, substitution would lead to one product from positions 3 and 5, and another product from position 6, totaling two products.

Therefore, the correct answer would be C)2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 on the benzene ring. The key considerations are the possible reactions under these conditions and the number of distinct organic products formed.

1. **Reaction Pathway Analysis**:  
   - NaNH₂ is a strong base, typically used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination. However, in this case, the reaction likely involves substitution or elimination.  
   - Substitution reactions in aromatic systems require nucleophilic attack, but the ring is not strongly activated for nucleophilic substitution due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing bromine.  
   - Elimination reactions typically require adjacent leaving groups, which is not the case here since there is only one bromine atom.  

2. **Substitution Consideration**:  
   - If substitution occurs, the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) would attack the ring at positions activated by the methyl groups (positions 3, 5, or 6).  
   - Positions 3 and 5 are symmetrically equivalent due to the molecule's structure, leading to only one unique product from these positions.  
   - Position 6 is adjacent to the bromine and less activated, potentially leading to a second distinct product.  

3. **Elimination Consideration**:  
   - Elimination to form a triple bond (benzyne) is unlikely because it requires two adjacent leaving groups, which are not present.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Substitution is the most plausible pathway, leading to two possible products: one from positions 3/5 (symmetrically equivalent) and another from position 6.  

Thus, the number of possible organic products is **2**.  

Answer: C
