Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. The spins are S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). And I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Oh wait, wait, no, wait. No, wait. The partition function is the sum over all states of exp(-β E), but since β is 1/(kT), sometimes people might express it as exp(-E/(kT)), which would be the same thing. So yeah, here β is 1/(kT), so yes.

Each spin has two possible states, +1 and -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. I can list them all, but maybe there's a smarter way. Because each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being ±1.

The energy E is -J multiplied by the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see, the possible values of E would depend on how the spins interact.

Let me think about the possible values of each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each of these is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if they're different.

Wait, no. Wait, S1 and S2 can be both +1 or both -1, which gives +1 for S1S2. If they're opposite, like S1=+1 and S2=-1, then S1S2 would be -1.

So the sum inside the brackets is the sum of these three products. So each term is either +1 or -1. Let's think about all possible combinations.

But maybe it's better to compute the energy for each state, then group them by how much their energies are, to find the number of states with each E.

So let's list all possible 8 states.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), each ±1.

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now for each state, compute E = -J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let's compute each term:

1. State 1: all +1. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1= -1. E= J.

4. State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

5. State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1= -1. E= J.

6. State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1= -1. E= J.

7. State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

8. State 8: all -1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -3J.

Wait, so the energy is either -3J or J in these states. Let me check.

Looking at states 1 and 8: all spins same (either all +1 or all -1). For state 1, E is -3J. For state 8, same: E= -3J.

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait in state 8, all spins are -1. So S1S2 is (-1)(-1)=1. Similarly for the other terms. So sum is 3, so E= -3J. Correct.

States 2-7: each has two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1. Let's see.

Wait, each of these states has two in one direction and one opposite. So for each such state, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 would be, as computed, -1.

So E is +J for these states.

So how many states have E = -3J? Just two: all +1 and all -1.

And the rest (6 states) have E = J.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recount the states:

States 1: E=-3J.

States 2-7: 6 states, E=J.

State 8: E=-3J.

So total states: 8. 2 with E=-3J, 6 with E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E_i). So Z = sum_{i=1 to 8} exp(-β E_i).

But since two states have E=-3J, and six have E= J.

So Z = 2 * exp(3 J β) + 6 * exp(- J β).

Wait, because E is -3J, so exp(-β E) = exp(3 J β).

Similarly, for E= J, exp(-β J) = exp(-J β).

So Z = 2 e^{3 J β} + 6 e^{- J β}.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B is Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}.

So the correct option must be B.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because the first term is negative exponent.

B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Which matches.

C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

D: 6 e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

So the correct answer is B.

To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). The partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, corresponding to all combinations of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) being \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). Each state is a triplet \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \).

### Step 2: Compute the energy for each state
The energy \( E \) depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), where each term \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if the spins are the same and \( -1 \) if they are different. For each state, the energy is calculated as \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \):

1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( 3 \), \( E = -3J \).
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( 3 \), \( E = -3J \).

### Step 3: Group states by energy
From the above, there are two states with \( E = -3J \) (all spins aligned) and six states with \( E = J \) (one spin opposite to the other two).

### Step 4: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of \( e^{-\beta E} \) for all states. For \( E = -3J \), \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3J\beta} \), and for \( E = J \), \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-J\beta} \). Thus:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**B) \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \).**
