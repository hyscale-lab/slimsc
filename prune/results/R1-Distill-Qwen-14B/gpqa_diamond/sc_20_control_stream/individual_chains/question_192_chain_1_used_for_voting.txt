Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor is like a bigger sphere with a hole in it, but the hole isn't at the center of the conductor.

Then, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

So, I need to figure out what the electric field at point P looks like. The options are four different expressions, each involving these variables.

I remember from my studies that conductors have some special properties when it comes to electric fields. Oh right! Inside a conductor, the electric field is zero in electrostatic equilibrium. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, and there's a charge inside the cavity. How does that affect things?

In a conductor with a cavity, the charges redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is initially neutral, but there's a charge inside the cavity, the conductor will have induced charges. I think the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside. So, if there's +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. But since the conductor itself was uncharged, the outer surface must then have +q to balance out. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has induced charges, so the outer surface must have the same charge as the inner surface's opposite. Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity (q) will induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero: inner surface is -q, outer is +q, so overall it's zero.

But wait, in this problem, the conductor is uncharged. So, the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner cavity's charge +q induces a -q on the inner surface, and the outer surface must then have +q because the conductor's total charge is -q (inner) + outer = 0. So outer has +q.

Now, electric fields outside a conductor are determined by the charges outside. Oh right, the shell theorem. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within the sphere. So, in this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of +q. So the field outside the conductor (at point P) should be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, so point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charges outside the Gaussian surface that encloses P. The charges on the conductor's outer surface are the ones that contribute to the field outside. Because the conductor's inner charges (the -q on the inner surface) don't affect the outside, they're screened.

Wait, no. The inner surface has -q, but that's inside the conductor. So the cavity's charge is +q, which is inside the conductor. But the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface has +q.

So when considering the electric field at a point outside the conductor, the only charge that matters is the total charge on the conductor's outer surface. So the conductor behaves as if all its charge is at the center, but since it's a conductor, the field outside is as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the charge is on the outer surface. So the Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose that charge. So the field at point P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / (L^2), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the enclosed charge is +q, right?

But wait, the conductor's outer charge is +q, so the field outside should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because using Gauss's law for a point outside a sphere, the field is as if all the charge were at the center.

Therefore, looking at the options, option B is (q/(4πε₀ L²)). So that's what I'm thinking.

But wait, let me consider another aspect. The point P is located at a distance l from the cavity's center, but the conductor's center is separated from the cavity's center by s. Does this affect the field?

Hmm. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is not at the center. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside due to that +q would be as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. But the charge distribution on the conductor's outer surface would be uniform only if the conductor is a solid sphere. Wait, but in this case, it's a conductor with a cavity, so the charges on the outer surface would distribute spherically symmetrically. So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces will result in the outer surface having +q uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the field outside would be as if the +q is at the center of the conductor.

So point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The direction of the field would depend on the position relative to the charge, but the magnitude should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

Wait, but let me think again about the setup. The point P is outside the conductor, but it's at a distance l from the cavity's center. The conductor's center is s away from the cavity's center. So the position of point P relative to the cavity's center is l distance away, and the angle between l and s is theta. So perhaps the displacement vectors are involved.

Wait, maybe the field due to the charge inside the cavity would be as if it's a point charge at its own center. But wait, that's inside the conductor. But the conductor's presence might affect this. Oh no, wait. Since the conductor is a conductor, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But the cavity is inside the conductor, so charges inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner surface.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the field at P is due to the charges on the conductor's outer surface. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't matter for the field outside. Because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is only dependent on the total charge on the outer surface.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So regardless of where the +q is inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Because the conductor is a sphere, even if the cavity isn't central, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform. Wait, no, wait. No, the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is not at the center. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But the inner surface's shape is not spherical; it's the shape of the cavity, which is a sphere but offset. Wait, no, the inner surface of the conductor would adjust to the shape of the cavity. Oh wait, the conductor is a spherical shell, so the inner surface would take the shape of the cavity. If the cavity is a sphere, then the inner surface is a sphere.

Wait, no. The conductor is a spherical shell of radius R. The cavity is a sphere of radius r, but its center is separated by s from the conductor's center. So the inner surface of the conductor would not be a perfect sphere but a portion near the cavity. Because the conductor is a shell, the inner surface would be a sphere? Wait, no. The inner surface must be a sphere if the conductor is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Because in electrostatics, the surfaces of conductors are equipotential, and for a sphere, the inner surface would adjust to be at a certain radius, but in this case, the cavity is not centered. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, but perhaps I should remember that the charges on the outer surface of the conductor are uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of the inner arrangement, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, leading to the field outside being as if the charge were at the center.

So the point P is outside the conductor, so the field is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L, so the magnitude is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So looking at the options, option B matches that. So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is $r$ ($r < R$). A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance of $P$ from the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To solve this, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, and the field outside is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Gauss's law, the electric field at $P$ is determined by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is $+q$. The field magnitude is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the geometry of the cavity (including the distance $s$ and angle $\theta$) do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression does not correctly account for the geometry of the problem or the fact that the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. This expression introduces unnecessary terms involving $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are irrelevant for the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While this expression has the correct dependence on $q$ and $l^2$, it does not account for the fact that the field outside depends on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
