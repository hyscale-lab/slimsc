Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy (OCH2CH3), position 2 is tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and position 3 is nitro (NO2). Wait, wait, the numbering might be different. Wait, the formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. Let me number the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, but in benzene, the numbering would be such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So maybe the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1,2,3-trisubstituted, but that's probably correct as given.

So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw a benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So all three substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions. The starting material is benzene, and we need to get to this compound. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. So I need to figure out the correct order of electrophilic substitution reactions and other steps.

First, I remember that the substituents on benzene can direct incoming electrophiles. Electron-donating groups (like -OCH2CH3, tert-butyl) are activating and ortho/para directors. Electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) are deactivating and meta directors.

So, the substituents will influence where the next group adds. The order in which we add the groups matters because each new group directs where the next can go.

Let me think about the substituents in the target:

1. Ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) is a strong activating group, ortho/para-directing.
2. tert-Butyl is a bulky substituent, but it's also an activating group (since it's an alkyl chain), so ortho/para-directing.
3. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but wait: in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So where are the other groups?

Assuming the benzene ring is numbered such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, let me imagine the benzene as:

Positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Wait, that would be a meta arrangement. Because 1 and 3 are two carbons apart. Alternatively, maybe it's ortho, meta, para? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, that's the same as having substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So starting from position 1, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. So they're adjacent, forming a trio. Because in benzene, each position is adjacent to the next.

So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent. So the substituents are in the 1,2,3-trisubstituted positions.

But how can that happen? Let's think about the order of adding substituents. Because each new substituent will direct the next substitution.

I think the general approach is to add the most activating groups first because they are easier to substitute and can help direct the next groups. Alternatively, sometimes you need to add deactivating groups in a certain position, which can complicate things.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so it's harder to substitute after that. So perhaps nitro should be added last, when the ring is as activated as possible.

Wait, but ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating, so adding them first would be good for directing the nitro group. Or maybe the nitro group is added early on.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's imagine the benzene ring:

Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3)
Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)
Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So the substituents are in adjacent positions, which suggests that the second and third substituents are added ortho to the first and second.

Wait, but how to achieve that.

Let me consider the possible steps:

1. Add the ethoxy group first. Since ethoxy is activating, it's a good leaving group for nitration or other substitutions.

After adding ethoxy, the next substitution can be in ortho or para. Wait, but for the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1). So perhaps after adding ethoxy, the next substituent is added in the ortho position.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are three in a row. Let's think in terms of adding one substituent, then another, then the third.

But perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.

Let me first think about the possible order of adding substituents. Since nitro is deactivating, it should be added last because once it's on the ring, it makes it harder to add more groups. Alternatively, if the nitro is added in a position where it's meta to another substituent, that could be easier.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4 (if that's another substituent). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try to plan the steps. Let's think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is an activating, ortho/para director.
2. tert-Butyl (C(CH3)3) is an activating, ortho/para director.
3. Nitro (NO2) is deactivating, meta director.

So, I need to add all three substituents. The order could be:

a) Add tert-butyl first.
b) Then add ethoxy.
c) Then add nitro.

But wait, if I add tert-butyl first, that would give me tert-butylbenzene. Then, adding ethoxy could be done via an electrophilic substitution. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, it would direct the next substituent to ortho or para.

So after tert-butyl, adding ethoxy would go ortho or para to it. Then, adding nitro would be next. But since nitro is deactivating and meta, perhaps it's better to add it last.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should add nitro in a position that's meta to another substituent.

Wait, maybe the order is: add tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy? Let me think.

Wait, nitro is deactivating. Once added, it directs incoming groups to meta positions. But if I add nitro after activating groups, it would be easier.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Let me go through each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Each step is a reaction condition, so I need to figure out what each step does.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl group in the adjacent position, then the nitro group in the next adjacent position. But how.

Wait, maybe the steps involve nitration, then alkylation, then another nitration? Or something else.

Let me think about each reaction step in the options.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl: possibly a reduction or another reaction; Fe/HCl is used for some reductions, but in the context of aromatic substitution, maybe it's a reagent for something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a nitration step, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each step.

Wait, benzene first is nitrated. So benzene goes to nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl... Wait, Fe and HCl is used in the benzidine rearrangement? Or maybe it's a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitration followed by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in the options more carefully. Let's look at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction of nitro to something else? Wait, Fe and HCl is sometimes used for nitrobenzene to aniline via reduction. But that's more like using H2/Pd or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a demethylation or another reaction. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the target again. The molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro substituents. So three substituents on benzene.

Each substituent addition is an electrophilic substitution. The order of addition determines where each substituent goes.

So, the first substituent can be any group. Let's suppose we add ethoxy first.

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene (if first substituent is nitro). But nitro is deactivating. So next substituents would have a harder time.

Alternatively, first substituent: ethoxy.

Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) via an etherification. For that, perhaps using an electrophilic substitution with an alkyl halide and AlCl3 as a catalyst. So step 1 could be treating benzene with ethyl chloride and AlCl3 to get ethoxybenzene (phenethyl ether? Or benzene with OCH2CH3).

Wait, but ethyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide, so it's less reactive in Friedel-Crafts. Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation usually requires AlCl3, but primary alkyl halides tend to undergo carbocation rearrangements. So using ethyl chloride might lead to rearrangement, giving mainly isopropyl groups. Hmm, but in the target, the substituent is ethoxy, so perhaps that's fine.

Alternatively, maybe using an ethoxide ion? No, maybe not. Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups. So if we use ethyl chloride and AlCl3, it should add an ethyl group as an ether, but wait, no: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group directly to benzene, but that's for alkanes, not ethers. Oh, wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups as in toluene, not as ethers.

Wait a minute, wait. Oh! Wait, I think I confused alkylation with ether synthesis. To make an ether, perhaps you need a different approach. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group to benzene, producing toluene derivatives. To make an ether, like OCH2CH3, you would need a different method. Maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's generally not straightforward with benzene.

Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Oh wait, wait. Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification. For that, maybe using an O-alkylation with an alkoxide. But that's not a common method for benzene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration followed by a substitution. No, that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually under high-temperature conditions and requires a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's added via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the steps in each option and see which makes sense.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

But nitro is a deactivating group. So the next substitution would be difficult. But maybe it's done.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps this is a reduction step. Nitrobenzene can be reduced to aniline with Fe/HCl. So nitrobenzene → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Aniline is activating, so it can undergo alkylation. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group. When aniline is treated with AlCl3 and an alkyl chloride, it would undergo alkylation. So aniline → (tert-butyl)aniline.

Wait, but where would the tert-butyl group add? Aniline has a strong activating NH2 group, which is a strong ortho/para director. So when you alkylate aniline, the alkyl group would enter ortho or para to the amino group.

Then, step iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the ring. But wait, the ring is already substituted with NH2 and t-Bu. So nitration would happen in a position directed by the substituents.

Wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para. The t-Bu is activating, but since it's a tertiary group, perhaps it's more of an ortho director due to steric hindrance? Or maybe it can't direct much.

Wait, but in para positions to the NH2 group, perhaps the nitration would add there. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps in option D:

1. Benzene → nitrobenzene (step i: nitration)
2. Nitrobenzene → aniline (step ii: Fe/HCl, reduction of nitro to amino)
3. Aniline → (tert-butyl)aniline (step iii: AlCl3 and t-BuCl; Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
4. (tert-butyl)aniline → nitrate again (step iv: HNO3/H2SO4)
5. Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But wait, after nitration, perhaps? Or after which step?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the product after each step.

After step iii: we have tert-butylaniline. Then, step iv is nitration. Since aniline is a strong activating group, the nitration would add in the ortho or para positions relative to the amino group. But the ring already has a tert-butyl group in a certain position.

Wait, perhaps the product after step iv is a ring with NH2, t-Bu, and NO2 groups. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps after nitrating the aniline, the nitro group is added in a position that's meta to another substituent.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the target structure. The target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2.

So, perhaps in the steps, after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, nitro is added in the adjacent position.

Wait, but in option D, step iv is nitrating after the t-Bu has been added. Let me think:

After step iii: the ring has NH2 and t-Bu. Now, upon nitration (step iv), the nitro group would add in the position directed by the strongest activating group. Aniline (NH2) is a stronger activating group than t-Bu. So the nitro would add ortho or para to NH2.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1), so perhaps that's the meta position relative to another substituent.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me think about the other options.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene → t-Bu-benzene (t-Bu is ortho/para director, activating).

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since t-Bu is activating, nitration occurs. Nitration adds in ortho or para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (Saponification? Or maybe forming a diazonium salt and then coupling?)

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are more about introducing substituents in the correct order.

Alternatively, let me think about the target's substituents:

We have three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), t-Bu, and nitro.

So, the order of addition could be:

1. Add t-Bu (as an activating group) → benzene becomes t-Bu-benzene.
2. Add nitro → since t-Bu is activating, nitro adds in ortho or para relative to t-Bu.
3. Add ethoxy → but the ethoxy group would need to be added in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to nitro?

Wait, but perhaps it's better to add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy, then the t-Bu. But nitro is deactivating, so that might complicate adding the other groups.

Alternatively, adding ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, let's try this:

1. Benzene → add ethoxy group. How? Using what reagents? For ethoxylation, perhaps using an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), but that usually needs a meta-directing group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong method. To introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps using an ethyl group as the electrophile. But benzene itself is hard to alkylate directly because it's deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts typically adds alkyl groups, not ethers. Oh wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Wait, to make an ether, another method is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a good leaving group and a strongly activating group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after activating the ring with another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction. For example, if there's a nitro group, which is a meta director, and then replaced with an ethoxy group. But that would require the nitro group to be present first.

Wait, perhaps we can do a nitration, then reduction to amine, then introduce the ethoxy group via some method... But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Let's say we have a meta-chloronitrobenzene, and then substitute Cl with OCH2CH3. But that's a more advanced reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an EAS using a suitable electrophile. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in the options and see which one logically leads to the target.

Looking back at the options, each option has several steps, some including nitration, alkylation, reductions, etc.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add t-Bu to benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? That typically adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since the ring now has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta), the nitration will be directed by the activating groups.

But after adding the sulfonic acid group, the ring is less activated. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to avoid sulfonation in the early steps because it deactivates the ring, making further substitutions harder.

Hmm, perhaps not the best option.

Option A: 

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now the ring has t-Bu and nitro.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation (adding another substituent). But then step iv is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

Wait, perhaps this is leading towards something else.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again? That seems odd, as the ring is already activated.

Option D:

i) nitrate first → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) nitrate → add another nitro group?

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the target: it has one nitro group, one ethoxy, and one t-Bu group.

So the substituents are three in number, each added via specific reactions.

Let me try to think about the correct order of substitution.

Perhaps the strategy is to first add the activating groups and then the deactivating group.

So the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-Bu group in an ortho position.

3. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to another substituent.

But how to do that.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a. Add ethoxy group: benzene → ethoxybenzene.

b. Add t-Bu group ortho to ethoxy.

c. Add nitro group in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But how to arrange these steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first as a meta director, but that would make adding the other groups difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is: ethoxy, then nitro, then t-Bu. But that might not work because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, maybe let's think about the positions.

After adding ethoxy, the ring is activated, so nitration would occur ortho/para to ethoxy. Then, adding t-Bu would require another substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group after the ethoxy and t-Bu.

Wait, let me think of the target structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the ring with ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, after adding ethoxy at position 1, the next substituent could be added ortho to ethoxy, which is position 2, as t-Bu. Then, the third substituent, nitro, would be added at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group. So, after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, which are both activating, the ring is highly activated. Adding nitro would be easier.

But wait, where would the nitro group go? It would be directed by the substituents already present.

After ethoxy and t-Bu, the ring has two activating groups. The ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2. So positions 3, 4,5,6 are available.

The incoming nitro group would be directed by the activating groups. Since both ethoxy and t-Bu are activating, their combined effect would determine the site of substitution.

But since both are ortho/para directors, perhaps the nitro would go into a position that is ortho or para to both, but that's not possible in a benzene ring. Alternatively, it might be directed by the group that's more activating or is in a position that allows it.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would add at position 3, which is adjacent to both 2 (t-Bu) and 4 (which is para to ethoxy at 1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in option B.

Option B steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So now, the ring has t-Bu and nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So now, the ring has t-Bu and NH2.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group. So this seems off.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2. So now, benzene has NH2.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts to aniline. So now, the ring has NH2 and t-Bu.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has NH2, t-Bu, and another nitro group.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro. So that's not matching.

Option A steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate. So ring has t-Bu and nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+ → acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2 (like Williamson).

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Wait, but that seems to have multiple nitro groups, which doesn't fit the target.

Option C steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, again, seems multiple nitro groups, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the steps needed to introduce each substituent.

The target:

- Ethoxy group at position 1.

- t-Bu at position 2.

- Nitro at position 3.

So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first. How?

Wait, I'm getting stuck on how to introduce the ethoxy group. Let me think: perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strong activating group to be already present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, if a nitro group is present, and then it's replaced with an ethoxy group.

Wait, for example:

Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

Then, nitro is reduced to amine → aniline.

Then, aniline undergoes O-alkylation to form anisole (ethoxy benzene).

Wait, but O-alkylation of aniline? Aniline has a NH2 group, which is a strong activating group. So perhaps, after reducing nitro to NH2, we can perform a nucleophilic substitution to introduce an ethoxy group.

Wait, but how. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to have a good leaving group in the ring. For example, if there's a nitro group in position 1, and then it's replaced by an ethoxy group.

Wait, nitro is a meta director. So, perhaps after introducing nitro, we can substitute it with ethoxy via some reaction.

But that's not straightforward. Nitro groups are not easily replaced without reducing them.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a benzyne intermediate. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that would give a methyl group, not an ether.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about which option correctly adds substituents in the right order.

Looking at option D again:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → add t-Bu group to aniline.

Aniline is a strong activating group. So the t-Bu group would add ortho or para to NH2.

Suppose the t-Bu adds para to NH2. Then, the ring has NH2 at position 1 and t-Bu at position 4.

Then, step iv: nitrate again. Now, the ring has NH2, t-Bu, and a new nitro group.

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the first nitration (step i) adds a nitro group in position 1. Then, after reduction, NH2 is at position 1. Then, step iii adds t-Bu in position 4 (para to NH2). Then, step iv nitrates again, but where?

The ring now has NH2 at 1 and t-Bu at 4. The NH2 is a strong activating group, so nitration (step iv) would occur ortho or para to NH2. Positions 2 and 6 (ortho) and 4 (para, already occupied by t-Bu) are available. So nitro would add at position 2 or 6.

If it adds at position 2, the ring would have NH2 (1), t-Bu (4), and nitro (2). Then, perhaps in later steps, the NH2 is converted to ethoxy.

Wait, but that's getting into more steps.

Wait, perhaps the steps after nitration involve replacing the NH2 group with ethoxy.

But how?

Wait, after nitration at position 2, the ring has NH2 (1), t-Bu (4), and nitro (2). Then, perhaps the NH2 is treated with something to become ethoxy.

But NH2 is an amino group. To convert it to OCH2CH3, perhaps a reaction like O-alkylation.

Wait, O-alkylation of aniline would require a good leaving group. Aniline can undergo O-alkylation under certain conditions, like using an alkyl halide with a strong base.

Wait, for example, treating aniline with ethyl bromide and a base could lead to O-ethylation. But I'm not entirely sure about the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino group is converted to a diazonium salt and then undergoes a substitution reaction.

Wait, if the NH2 is at position 1, and we treat it with NaNO2 and HCl (diazotization), forming a diazonium chloride. Then, if we have a good leaving group, perhaps it can be substituted with an ethoxy group. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps using H3O+ and heat would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol, and then ethyl bromide and NaOH would introduce the ethoxy group via an SN2 mechanism. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's see the steps in option D after step iv (nitration):

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → not sure.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction to substitute Br with OCH2CH3?

But wait, if after step vi, the ring has a hydroxyl group (phenol) at position 1, then treating with NaOH and EtBr would perform an O-alkylation, adding the ethoxy group.

So putting this together:

After step iv, the ring has NH2 (1), t-Bu (4), nitro (2).

Step v: Diazotization → NH2 becomes diazonium.

Step vi: Heating with H3O+ → hydrolyzes to OH (phenol) at 1.

Then, step ix: NaOH and EtBr → O-ethylation of phenol to form ethoxy group.

So now, the ring has OCH2CH3 (1), t-Bu (4), nitro (2).

But in the target, the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro). So this doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps the order is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the steps in option D as:

After step iv, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1.

Wait, but in this case, how would that happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy group is in place.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu to benzene → t-Bu-benzene.

2. Add nitro group → directed by t-Bu.

3. Add ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: let me count the number of substituents.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro.

Each substitution is a separate step. So, the correct option must have three nitration steps? Or some other steps.

Wait, looking at option D:

i) Nitration → 1 nitro.

ii) Reduction → NH2.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Hydrolysis.

vii) Dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) NaOH, EtBr.

So, in total, two nitro groups are added. But the target has only one. So this is incorrect.

Option B has:

i) t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → 1 nitro.

iii) Reduction → NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → 2 nitro.

Which again, target has one.

Option A: two nitro groups.

Option C: two nitro groups.

Hmm, none of the options seem to have exactly three substituents. Wait, target has three substituents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the substituents. Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So three substituents: ethoxy (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3). So each substituent is added in a separate step.

So the correct option must have three substitution steps, each adding one substituent.

Looking at the options:

Option D has steps that include two nitration steps (i and iv), which would add two nitro groups. So that's too many. Option B also has two nitrations.

Option A has two nitrations.

Option C has two nitrations.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding the nitro group once, and ethoxy and t-Bu in other steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is: add t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Let me think about the steps in option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Reduce → NH2.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro.

Which adds two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct option is not D.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro.

Hmm, again two nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not any of these. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in a different position, and the steps involve more than just nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after nitration.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

But how.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-Bu and nitro, the ring has two substituents, and the ethoxy is added via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strong activating group. For example, after nitration, perhaps the nitro group is replaced with ethoxy.

But that's unlikely without a good leaving group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the order is nitrate, then add t-Bu, then add ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making it harder to add the other groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then the nitro, then the t-Bu.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would require an activating group already present. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after some activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond this problem.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct option based on the substitution steps.

The target has ethoxy, nitro, and t-Bu.

Looking at option D again:

The steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Reduce → NH2.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Hydrolysis → OH.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → OCH2CH3.

So the substituents after each step:

After i: nitro at position 1.

After ii: NH2 at 1.

After iii: t-Bu added, likely at position 4 (para to NH2).

After iv: nitro added, say at position 2 (ortho to NH2).

After v: NH2 → diazonium.

After vi: NH2 → OH (phenol) at position 1.

After ix: OCH2CH3 added via O-ethylation, replacing OH.

So substituents are OCH2CH3 (1), t-Bu (4), nitro (2).

But the target is OCH2CH3 (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

So the positions don't match.

Hmm, perhaps the order in which the substituents are added in option D leads to incorrect positions.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect.

Looking at option B:

Steps:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu at position 1.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 3 (meta to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 at 3.

iv) nitrate again → but where? The NH2 is a strong activator, so nitro would add ortho or para to NH2.

After step iv, nitro at position 5 (meta to t-Bu and para to NH2?).

Then, steps v to ix involve diazotization and other steps, leading to substitution.

But this doesn't seem to lead to the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not fully seeing the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But in option D, it's nitro, then t-Bu, then nitro again.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nitro group is added last.

Which options add the nitro last?

Looking at the options, perhaps option B: nitro is added early, then reduced, then another nitro is added.

No. Option C: nitro is added after sulfonation, which is deactivating.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Because the steps in D seem to involve adding substituents in a way that allows the nitro group to be in the correct position.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck trying to track all the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because it has the sequence where the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group is in place.

Wait, no. In option D, nitro is added before the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the order of directing.

The ethoxy group is a strong activating, ortho/para director.

The t-Bu group is also activating, ortho/para.

The nitro is deactivating, meta.

So, to get nitro at position 3, perhaps it must be added after ethoxy and t-Bu are in place.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, but that would make the ring deactivating, making further substitution difficult.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let me imagine each substituent's position.

If ethoxy is at position 1, and t-Bu is at position 2, then where would the nitro group go? It would be at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to t-Bu.

But how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu to benzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro at position 3 (meta to t-Bu).

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

But how.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, and the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add nitro (step i), reduce to NH2 (step ii), alkylate to add t-Bu (step iii), then nitrate again (step iv) to add another nitro, but that would give two nitro groups, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck trying to figure out the correct option. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the steps.

The target requires three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro. The correct option should have these substituents added in an order that allows each to be directed properly.

Option D seems to involve adding nitro first, then t-Bu, then nitro again. But that adds two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Option B: t-Bu, nitro, nitro again. No.

Option C: t-Bu, sulfonate, nitro, nitro again. No.

Option A: t-Bu, nitro, nitro again. No.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, as it's the only one that adds the substituents in an order that could lead to the correct positions.

After struggling, I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the activation state of the aromatic ring. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) at position 1, tert-butyl (C(CH3)3) at position 2, and nitro (-NO2) at position 3. The synthesis must ensure that each substituent is added in the correct position relative to the others.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 adds the tert-butyl group to benzene.
   - Step ii: Nitration adds a nitro group, which would likely be ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating and meta-directing.
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxylation. However, the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions for the substituents in the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 adds the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iii: Reduction of nitro to amine changes the directing effects.
   - Step iv: A second nitration step introduces another nitro group, but the target molecule has only one nitro group, making this option incorrect.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 adds the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which deactivates the ring and complicates further substitution.
   - Step iii: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the deactivating sulfonic acid group makes it difficult to achieve the desired substitution pattern.
   - This option does not align with the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitration introduces a nitro group, which is deactivating and meta-directing.
   - Step ii: Reduction of nitro to amine activates the ring again, making it easier to add subsequent substituents.
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group, which is ortho/para-directing.
   - Step iv: A second nitration step adds another nitro group, but the target molecule has only one nitro group, making this step problematic.
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxylation. While the sequence partially aligns with the target structure, the addition of two nitro groups makes this option inconsistent with the target.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none perfectly match the target molecule due to issues such as incorrect substitution patterns or the addition of extra nitro groups. However, **Option D** comes closest to aligning with the desired sequence, as it involves reducing nitro to amine, adding tert-butyl, and introducing ethoxy in later steps. Despite the challenges in fully matching the target, Option D is the most plausible among the given choices.
