Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about space travel and time dilation, I think. So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud sending a spacecraft to Earth. Their astronaut is 22 years old, and the spacecraft is moving at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. I need to find out how long it takes for the astronaut, from their own perspective, to reach Earth. And the options are whether the astronaut dies before arriving or some number of years.

Wait, so the key here is time dilation because the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity where time passes differently for the traveler compared to someone on Earth.

But wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So, the astronaut's expected lifetime is 150 years from their own frame of reference. But when they're traveling at such a high speed, their experienced time would be less due to time dilation.

Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is less than the time observed in the Earth's frame. Because from Earth's perspective, the astronaut's clock is running slow. But wait, no, the other way around. Let me think again.

When an object is moving at a high speed relative to an observer, the observer will see the moving clock as ticking slower. So, from Earth's point of view, the astronaut's clock is ticking more slowly. But from the astronaut's perspective, Earth clocks are moving and thus would tick slower. Hmm, but that's the relativity of simultaneity and all that.

Wait, but in this problem, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut. So, we need to compute the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

So, the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud – wait, that's a key factor. How far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Wait, but wait, the problem says the spacecraft is going to Earth. So, the Earth is their destination. So, the distance is the distance in the astronaut's frame, but wait, no, the distance is contracted in their frame because they're moving.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The proper distance is the distance in the rest frame of the destination. So, if we consider Earth as the destination, the distance between the LMC and Earth is roughly 160,000 light-years. So, from Earth's frame, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, so the time it takes is distance over speed. So, 160,000 ly divided by 0.99999987c.

Wait, but wait, since c is the speed of light, 1 ly per year. So, the time from Earth's perspective would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years. But that's from Earth's frame. But the astronaut's experienced time is much less due to time dilation.

So, the astronaut's proper time is calculated using the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula for proper time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait, the other way around. Proper time is the time experienced by the moving observer. So, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, using the formula: tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's compute that. First, calculate gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, let's compute that.

But wait, maybe I can approximate because the speed is very close to c. Let me compute 1 - v²/c².

v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 = approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Let me compute that.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=1.3e-7. So, approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4.

Wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001. So, 3.16e-4 is ~0.000316.

So, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051 (Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. So, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Hmm, 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 = 0.001 * 0.3162 ≈ 0.0003162. So, sqrt(2.6)=~1.612, so 1.612 * 0.0003162 ≈ 0.00051. So, sqrt is approx 5.1e-4. So, gamma is 1 / 5.1e-4 ≈ 1960.78.

So, gamma is about 1960. So, the time experienced by the astronaut, tau, is t_earth / gamma.

Wait, because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So, t_earth is 160,000 years (approx distance divided by speed). So, tau = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 160,000 divided by 1960.

Well, 1960 is 2000 - 40. Let's compute it as 160,000 / 2000 = 80, but since it's divided by 1960, which is a bit less than 2000, the result will be a bit higher than 80.

Wait, 1960 is 2000 * 0.98. So, 160,000 / 1960 = 160000 / (2000 * 0.98) )= (160000 / 2000) / 0.98 = 80 / 0.98 ≈ 81.63 years.

Wait, that's approximately 81.6 years. But the initial distance I used was 160,000 light-years. Is that accurate?

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So, that's correct.

So, the astronaut's experienced time is about 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old. So, 22 + 81.6 is about 103.6 years. But the average lifetime is 150 years. So, the astronaut would live long enough to reach Earth. So, the answer would be around 81 years.

Looking at the options:

A) Astronaut will die before reaching Earth: No, because 81 < 150.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150, so if the trip takes 81 years, the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150. So, they are alive.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time. So, if the trip takes 81 years from their perspective, then they would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifetime of 150. So, the answer is 81 years, which is option C) 81 years.

Wait, but let me think again about the calculation. Let me be more precise.

v = 0.99999987 c. So, v^2/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

Gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961.

So, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth is the time from Earth's frame, which is distance/speed.

Distance is 160,000 ly. Speed is 0.99999987c.

So, time is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 160,000 years.

So, tau = 160,000 / 1961 ≈ 81.5 years.

So, approximately 81.5 years, which rounds to 81 or 82. The options have 81 as option C.

So, the answer is option C, 81 years.

To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for time dilation due to the spacecraft traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \). The key formulas are:

1. **Time dilation formula**:  
   \[
   \tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]  
   where \( \tau \) is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, and \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) is the time measured in Earth's frame.

2. **Lorentz factor**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Thus, \( \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The velocity is \( v = 0.99999987c \). Compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):  
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]  
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
\]  
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]  
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \approx \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( 160,000 \, \text{ly} \). The time measured in Earth's frame is:  
\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:  
\[
\tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the astronaut's lifetime
The astronaut is initially 22 years old. Upon arrival, they would be \( 22 + 81.5 = 103.5 \) years old, which is well within their average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Final Answer
The astronaut will experience approximately **81 years** during the trip.

So, from Earth's frame, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, so the time it takes is distance over speed. So, 160,000 ly divided by 0.99999987c.

Wait, but wait, since c is the speed of light, 1 ly per year. So, the time from Earth's perspective would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years. But that's from Earth's frame. But the astronaut's experienced time is much less due to time dilation.

Wait, but wait, the other way around. Proper time is the time experienced by the moving observer. So, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, using the formula: tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's compute that. First, calculate gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, let's compute that.

But wait, maybe I can approximate because the speed is very close to c. Let me compute 1 - v²/c².

v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 = approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Let me compute that.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=1.3e-7. So, approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4.

Wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001. So, 3.16e-4 is ~0.000316.

So, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051 (Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. So, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Hmm, 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 = 0.001 * 0.3162 ≈ 0.0003162. So, sqrt(2.6)=~1.612, so 1.612 * 0.0003162 ≈ 0.00051. So, sqrt is approx 5.1e-4. So, gamma is 1 / 5.1e-4 ≈ 1960.78.

So, gamma is about 1960. So, the time experienced by the astronaut, tau, is t_earth / gamma.

Wait, because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So, t_earth is 160,000 years (approx distance divided by speed). So, tau = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 160,000 divided by 1960.

Well, 1960 is 2000 - 40. Let's compute it as 160,000 / 2000 = 80, but since it's divided by 1960, which is a bit less than 2000, the result will be a bit higher than 80.

Wait, 1960 is 2000 * 0.98. So, 160,000 / 1960 = 160000 / (2000 * 0.98) )= (160000 / 2000) / 0.98 = 80 / 0.98 ≈ 81.63 years.

Wait, that's approximately 81.6 years. But the initial distance I used was 160,000 light-years. Is that accurate?

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So, that's correct.

So, the astronaut's experienced time is about 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old. So, 22 + 81.6 is about 103.6 years. But the average lifetime is 150 years. So, the astronaut would live long enough to reach Earth. So, the answer would be around 81 years.

Looking at the options:

A) Astronaut will die before reaching Earth: No, because 81 < 150.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150, so if the trip takes 81 years, the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150. So, they are alive.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time. So, if the trip takes 81 years from their perspective, then they would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifetime of 150. So, the answer is 81 years, which is option C) 81 years.

Wait, but let me think again about the calculation. Let me be more precise.

v = 0.99999987 c. So, v^2/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

Gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961.

So, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth is the time from Earth's frame, which is distance/speed.

Distance is 160,000 ly. Speed is 0.99999987c.

So, time is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 160,000 years.

So, tau = 160,000 / 1961 ≈ 81.5 years.

So, approximately 81.5 years, which rounds to 81 or 82. The options have 81 as option C.

So, the answer is option C, 81 years.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for time dilation due to the spacecraft traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \). The key formulas are:

1. **Time dilation formula**:  
   \[
   \tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]  
   where \( \tau \) is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, and \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) is the time measured in Earth's frame.

2. **Lorentz factor**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Thus, \( \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The velocity is \( v = 0.99999987c \). Compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):  
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]  
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
\]  
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]  
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \approx \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( 160,000 \, \text{ly} \). The time measured in Earth's frame is:  
\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:  
\[
\tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the astronaut's lifetime
The astronaut is initially 22 years old. Upon arrival, they would be \( 22 + 81.5 = 103.5 \) years old, which is well within their average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Final Answer
The astronaut will experience approximately **81 years** during the trip.  

Answer: C
