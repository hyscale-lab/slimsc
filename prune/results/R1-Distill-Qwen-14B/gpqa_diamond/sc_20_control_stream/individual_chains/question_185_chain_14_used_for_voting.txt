Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let's see what the problem says.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Hmm, right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σ · n would be the dot product of the vector σ with the unit vector n.

Wait, I remember that for any unit vector n, the expression σ · n is a Pauli matrix in the direction of n. So if n is, say, along the z-axis, then σ · n would just be σz. But n can be any direction here.

I also recall that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Each Pauli matrix like σx, σy, σz individually has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have σ · n, it's a combination of these matrices multiplied by the components of n.

Wait, but actually, σ · n is a Hermitian operator since it's a sum of Hermitian matrices (Pauli matrices are Hermitian) multiplied by real coefficients (since n is a unit vector with real components, I assume, since it's a direction). So the eigenvalues should be real.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. But when you scale them by ε, does that change the eigenvalues? Let me think. The operator is H = ε (σ · n). Since σ · n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1, multiplying it by ε (which is a scalar with units of energy) scales the eigenvalues by ε.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's say σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Then H would have eigenvalues ε * 1 = ε and ε * (-1) = -ε. So the eigenvalues should be ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Do I remember correctly about the eigenvalues of σ · n? Another way to think: since n is a unit vector, the matrix σ · n is a traceless 2x2 matrix. The trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant would be (σ · n)^2 determinant? Wait, no, the determinant of σ · n is (since σ · n is a 2x2 matrix) perhaps (-1), because each Pauli matrix has determinant -1. Wait, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], determinant -1. Similarly for σy and σz. So any σ · n matrix would have determinant (σ · n)^2 = I (since (σ · n)^2 = (n · σ)(n · σ) = n · (σ) n · σ = (n · (σ · n)) ? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it another way.

Wait, σ · n is a matrix which, when squared, gives I. Because (σ · n)^2 = (σ · n)(σ · n) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Now, σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when you sum over i and j, n_i n_j (δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k) becomes (n_i^2 I) + i sum(n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k). But since n is a unit vector, n_i^2 summed over i is 1. And the sum with the epsilon term would involve terms like n_i n_j n_k ε_ijk (which is zero because when i,j,k are summed, and ε is antisymmetric, but maybe I'm overcomplicating).

Alternatively, another approach: for any unit vector n, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding that, each σ_i squared is I, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j which are i ε_ijk σ_k. But when you take the square, the cross terms will come with factors.

Wait, but regardless, the important thing is that (σ · n)^2 = I, because when you consider that the square of a Pauli matrix in any direction is the identity. Because (σ · n) is like a spin component operator. So (σ · n)^2 = I. That makes sense because the eigenvalues are squared, so (1)^2 and (-1)^2 give 1.

So, if (σ · n)^2 = I, then the eigenvalues of (σ · n) are ±1. So H = ε (σ · n) would have eigenvalues ε*(1) and ε*(-1), so ±ε.

Looking back at the options, option B is +ε and -ε.

So the answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is an energy constant. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing the properties of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\), weighted by the components of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\). Since the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is also Hermitian, ensuring that its eigenvalues are real. Additionally, \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is traceless (its trace is zero) and its eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\), as is the case for any Pauli matrix in a given direction.

When scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\). This follows directly from the fact that scaling an operator by a constant scales its eigenvalues by the same constant.

Examining the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as it matches the derived eigenvalues.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \(\hbar/2\).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\), making **Option B** the correct answer.
