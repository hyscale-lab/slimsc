Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think this through.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, so when a substance emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. But wait, absorption is when it takes in energy, right? Oh right, I remember something about electrons getting excited. When a molecule absorbs a photon, an electron moves from a lower energy level to a higher one. When it relaxes back, it emits light.

So the energy of the photon absorbed must be related to the energy emitted. Oh, because when the electron drops back, the energy emitted is the same as the absorbed, right? Or wait, is it? Because the emitted photon's energy comes from the difference in energy levels. So if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV, that might be the energy difference between the excited and ground states.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. So the absorbed light is the one causing the electron jump. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted? Or is it the same? Wait, no, when the electron is excited, it's absorbing a photon of energy E. Then when it drops, it emits a photon perhaps with a lower energy? Or same? Wait, maybe the energy is the same. Because the energy of absorption and emission would be the same, but that can't be right because sometimes there are losses. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the complementary color.

Wait, energy and wavelength are inversely related by E = hc/λ. So higher energy means shorter wavelength. The visible spectrum goes from violet (short wavelength, high energy) to red (long wavelength, low energy).

So the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate what the corresponding wavelength is. Because wavelength is more directly linked to color.

So E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. E is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, I need to convert eV to joules because the units have to match. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules.

So E in J is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) 

Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator is 3.745e-19.

So λ ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 = approx 5.31e-7 meters.

Which is 531 nm. Hmm, because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 531 nm is in the visible range.

Wait, 400 nm is violet, 500 blue, 570 green, 600 orange, 700 red. So 531 is between blue and green. Wait, 500 is blue, 550 is green. So 531 is closer to green? Or wait, maybe I should think about where it is. 531 is in the green area. So the wavelength emitted is about 531 nm, which is green.

But wait, the question is about the absorbed light. Because when a substance emits light of a certain wavelength, it absorbed the complementary color. Like, if something emits green, it’s because it absorbed the complementary, which is magenta. But wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, in the context of dyes, the color we see is what they transmit or emit. If a dye emits green when excited, then the color we see is green. But the absorbed color would be the one that's not transmitted. So the absorption would be in the opposite part of the spectrum.

Wait, the color we see is the color that's transmitted or reflected. So if it's emitting green, it's because it absorbed higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons and then re-emits lower energy (longer wavelength) ones. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, when the dye absorbs a photon, it excites an electron, then when the electron relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon because the electron had to be excited from ground to excited.

Wait, no, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon if it's a two-level system. But in reality, there might be other energy levels, but assuming a simple system, the energy is the same.

Wait, no, because when the molecule absorbs a photon, the electron moves to a higher energy level. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. If it goes directly from the excited state to the ground state, then the emitted photon's energy would be the same as the absorbed one. But in reality, maybe it's a different transition. So perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light of 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the photon emitted. So what energy photon is absorbed? Oh wait, maybe it's the same. Because the absorbed photon provides the energy to excite the electron. Then when it relaxes, it emits the same energy. But that would mean that the wavelength is the same. But that doesn't make sense because the color you see is the emission, and the absorbed is the same. Wait, but if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. Because emitting green would require the molecule to drop from a higher energy state to a lower one, emitting green. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted.

So let me think again. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher, because it's what excited the molecule.

So let's compute the wavelength of 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

I did that earlier and got around 531 nm, which is green. So the emitted photon is green. Therefore, the absorbed photon would have higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, no, because when an electron absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state. When it drops, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the difference between the initial and final states. So the absorbed photon's energy is the same as the transition energy, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's think about the colors. The dye emits green. So the color we see is green. That means the dye is absorbing the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta. But wait, that's for color mixing. Hmm, maybe in this case, the absorbed light is what's causing the emission.

Wait, another approach. The energy of the photon absorbed is equal to the energy gap between the ground and excited state. So the energy absorbed is the same as the energy emitted. Wait, but that's not correct if the molecule has multiple energy levels. But perhaps the simplest case is that E_absorbed = E_emission.

Wait, but that can't be right because if you absorb a photon and emit it immediately, you'd have the same wavelength, but that's fluorescence, right? So the energy levels have to be such that the emitted photon is lower energy than the absorbed photon. Because when the electron de-excites, it emits a lower energy photon. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is about 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that, meaning a shorter wavelength, which is higher energy.

Wait, but higher energy than 2.3393 eV would be in the violet or blue range. Because green is around 2.3 eV (since E = 1240 / wavelength in nm). Let me check: 1240 nm·eV / 531 nm ≈ 2.337 eV. So yeah, that's right.

So the emitted photon is green. The absorbed photon must be higher energy. So the color absorbed is the complementary of green, which is magenta, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, the dye emits light when it is excited, so the absorbed light is what causes the emission. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than emitted. So the absorbed light is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) part of the spectrum.

So the emitted is green (531 nm), so the absorbed is higher energy than that. Let's compute what color 2.3393 eV corresponds to. That's green, so the absorbed must have higher energy than that.

Wait, but the question asks what color is absorbed. So the absorbed photon has a higher energy than the emitted. So if the emitted is green (around 530), the absorbed would be in the blue or violet range.

So, the options are A) Red (low energy, long wavelength), B) Violet (high energy, short wavelength), C) Blue (middle-high), D) Yellow (lower than green).

Wait, the emitted is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed must be higher than that. Because the molecule can't emit higher energy than it absorbed. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so the wavelength is shorter.

So the emitted is 531 nm (green), the absorbed would be a shorter wavelength, like blue or violet.

Wait, the possible options are violet, blue, etc. Let's find what 2.3393 eV corresponds to.

Wait, 2.3393 eV: using E = 1240 / lambda (in nm). So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 531 nm. Green.

So the emitted photon is green, which means the molecule absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 531 nm. So the color absorbed is in the blue or violet regions.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

So which is it?

Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV because the molecule can't emit more energy than it absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV, so shorter wavelength than 531 nm.

So the absorbed photon's wavelength is less than 531 nm. So it's in the blue or violet region.

Now, the question is which color corresponds to higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Violet has a higher energy than blue because it has a shorter wavelength. So if the absorbed light is violet, that's higher energy than blue.

So the absorbed light would be violet.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = 2.3393 eV plus some other possible transitions? Or is it exactly 2.3393 eV? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the dye emits light in the green range, so it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which is in the blue or violet. So which of the options fits?

The options are A)Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed color is either B or C.

Wait, let me think about what color is absorbed when the emitted is green. The color wheel's complementary colors: green's complement is magenta, which is a combination of blue and red. But that's for color mixing. But in terms of absorption, when a substance emits green, it's because it absorbed all colors except green, which it reflects or transmits.

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of dyes, they absorb certain wavelengths and transmit others. If a dye emits green when excited (fluorescence), then the absorbed light must be in a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted. So the absorbed light is blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, how can I choose between B and C?

Wait, the problem states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, which is the energy of the photon emitted. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the states. Wait, but perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think of it this way: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gains energy. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than or equal to the absorbed.

But the question says the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Which color has higher energy than green?

Looking at the visible spectrum, violet is higher energy than green.

So the absorbed light is violet.

So the correct answer is B) Violet.

The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. To solve this, we analyze the relationship between energy, wavelength, and color.

1. **Energy and Wavelength Relationship**: The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, as described by the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Here, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Rearranging, \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \).

2. **Energy to Wavelength Calculation**: The emitted energy is given as \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). Converting this to joules (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we get \( E = 3.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Using \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the wavelength is calculated as:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{3.745 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 531 \, \text{nm}.
   \]
   This corresponds to green light.

3. **Absorbed vs. Emitted Light**: The dye emits light with energy \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \) (green light). For the dye to emit this light, it must absorb a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite an electron to a higher energy state. When the electron relaxes, it emits the lower energy photon (green light).

4. **Color of Absorbed Light**: Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, its wavelength is shorter than \( 531 \, \text{nm} \). Among the options, violet light has a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than blue light, making violet the absorbed color.

5. **Conclusion**: The dye absorbs violet light, which corresponds to a higher energy than the emitted green light.

Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

So the correct answer is B) Violet.


The question involves determining the color of light absorbed by a textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. To solve this, we analyze the relationship between energy, wavelength, and color.

1. **Energy and Wavelength Relationship**: The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, as described by the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Here, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Rearranging, \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \).

2. **Energy to Wavelength Calculation**: The emitted energy is given as \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \). Converting this to joules (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we get \( E = 3.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Using \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the wavelength is calculated as:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{3.745 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 531 \, \text{nm}.
   \]
   This corresponds to green light.

3. **Absorbed vs. Emitted Light**: The dye emits light with energy \( 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \) (green light). For the dye to emit this light, it must absorb a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite an electron to a higher energy state. When the electron relaxes, it emits the lower energy photon (green light).

4. **Color of Absorbed Light**: Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, its wavelength is shorter than \( 531 \, \text{nm} \). Among the options, violet light has a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than blue light, making violet the absorbed color.

5. **Conclusion**: The dye absorbs violet light, which corresponds to a higher energy than the emitted green light.

Answer: B
