Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. So the question is about the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes already. The initial information says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay probability is independent of time, meaning that each atom has a constant probability per unit time of decaying. So the key here is to find the decay constant and then calculate the probability for the remaining time.

First, let me think about the given data. The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. I think the formula for the probability of decay (P) is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me rearrange this to solve for λ. Subtract both sides from 1: 0.68 = e^(-100λ). Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that, ln(0.68) is approximately... let me think. I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is close to 0.7, so ln(0.7) is around -0.356. But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, I can use a calculator if I were doing this for real, but since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed with the approximate value.

Wait, actually, let me think. Let me compute ln(0.68). Let's see, 0.68 is e^x. e^(-0.4) is about 0.67, because e^0.4 is approximately 1.4918, so 1/1.4918 is about 0.6703. Oh, wait, that's close to 0.68. Hmm, maybe my approximation is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I can think that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385. Let me check: e^0.385 is about 1.469. So 1/e^0.385 is 0.681, which is close to 0.68. So λ = 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Wait, actually, for precise calculation, perhaps I should use a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, maybe I can proceed with the approximation.

So λ ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Now, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time we're looking at is 150 minutes more. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the question says that so far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom has not decayed. So the total time from the beginning is 50 minutes, and we're now looking at the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes depends only on the remaining time, not on how long it's been since it started.

Wait, no, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So we're considering the conditional probability. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, but I think I need to compute the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200.

So the probability would be the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but the exponential distribution has the memoryless property. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes starting now. So the conditional probability is P( decay in 150 minutes | no decay in 50 minutes ) = probability of decay in 150 minutes.

But wait, the initial data is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So I think the approach is to find λ from that, and then compute the probability over 150 minutes, but perhaps after 50 minutes have passed.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The initial setup is that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so in other words, in 100 minutes, 32% chance of decay. So using that, we can find λ.

Then, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and no decay, what is the chance that it decays in the next 150 minutes.

But since the decay is memoryless, the probability is the same as if it just started, and we're considering 150 minutes. So P( decay in 150 ) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total time from the start to 200 minutes, but that's not correct because the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, so the probability of decay in the next 150 from t=50 to t=200 is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting at any point.

Wait, but the initial condition is that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which gives us λ. So perhaps the way to approach this is to compute P( decay at any time within 100 minutes) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ*100}, which gives λ as I computed before.

Now, the problem is, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, what is the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., total time from start is 200 minutes). But wait, no, because the memoryless property tells us that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is just P(decay in 150 minutes) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

So using our λ, which is approximately 0.00385 per minute. Let's compute that.

So λ = 0.00385 per minute.

Compute 150 * λ = 150 * 0.00385 = 0.5775.

Then, 1 - e^{-0.5775}.

What is e^{-0.5775}?

I know that e^{-0.5} is about 0.6065, e^{-0.6} is about 0.5488, e^{-0.5775} is somewhere between those. Maybe around 0.561.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Let me think: the value of e^{-0.5775}.

We can approximate it using Taylor series or known values.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator: e^-0.5775 ≈ 0.561.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate it more accurately.

Let me consider x=0.5775.

e^{-x} = 1/(e^{x}).

We can compute e^0.5775:

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872,

e^0.0775 ≈ 1 + 0.0775 + (0.0775)^2/2 + (0.0775)^3/6 + ...

0.0775^2 = 0.006006. Divided by 2 is 0.003003.

0.0775^3 = 0.0004657. Divided by 6 is about 0.0000776.

So e^0.0775 ≈ 1 + 0.0775 + 0.003003 + 0.0000776 ≈ 1.08058.

So e^0.5775 = e^{0.5 + 0.0775} = e^0.5 * e^0.0775 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08058.

Let me compute that: 1.64872 * 1.08058.

Multiply 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

1.64872 * 0.00058 ≈ approx 0.000957.

Adding those: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.000957 ≈ 1.7815746.

So e^0.5775 ≈ 1.78157.

So e^{-0.5775} = 1 / 1.78157 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - e^{-0.5775} ≈ 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%, option B)40%, etc.

Wait, but let me double-check λ because perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, the initial condition: P( decay within 100 minutes ) is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}.

So e^{-100λ} = 0.68.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662.

So 100λ = 0.385662 → λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Which gives λ * 150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.

So e^{-0.578493} ≈ ?

Hmm, perhaps better to compute it again.

Let me think, e^{-0.5785}.

Again, let me approximate.

We can consider that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. So 0.5785 is less than ln(2), so e^{-0.5785} is about 0.56.

Alternatively, perhaps a precise calculation:

We can use the Taylor series for e^{-x} around x=0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps think of e^{-0.5785} = 1 / e^{0.5785}.

Compute e^{0.5785}.

What is 0.5785?

It's 0.5 + 0.0785.

So e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872.

Compute e^{0.0785}.

Using the expansion: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

x = 0.0785.

x² = 0.00616225.

x³ = 0.000483.

x^4 = 0.0000378.

So e^{0.0785} ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.00616225/2 + 0.000483/6 + 0.0000378/24.

Compute each term:

0.0785 is 0.0785.

0.00616225/2 = 0.003081125.

0.000483/6 ≈ 0.0000805.

0.0000378/24 ≈ 0.000001575.

Adding them together:

1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785.

Plus 0.003081125 → 1.081581125.

Plus 0.0000805 → 1.081661625.

Plus 0.000001575 → 1.0816632.

So e^{0.0785} ≈ 1.08166.

So e^{0.5785} = e^{0.5} * e^{0.0785} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08166.

Compute that:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

1.64872 * 0.00166 ≈ approx 0.00273.

Add them: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.00273 → ~1.7833476.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.78335.

So e^{-0.5785} = 1/1.78335 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%. 

Looking back at the options, option A is 44%, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A) 44%.

Wait a minute, but wait another thing. Another approach: perhaps the initial 32% is for a 100-minute period, and the question is about 150 minutes. So the total probability for 150 minutes is higher than 32%.

But wait, no. Because the initial 32% is from 0 to 100 minutes. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed. Oh wait, no. Wait, the initial 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. So the decay can happen any time within that 100. Now, when 50 minutes have passed and no decay, the probability of decaying in the next 150 should be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which depends on λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is 44%, which is option A.

But wait, another way to think: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^{-λ*50}.

So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P( decay in 150 | no decay in 50 ) = [P( decay between 50 and 200 ) ] / [ P( no decay in 50 ) ]

Which is [1 - e^{-λ*(200)} ] - [1 - e^{-λ*(50)} ] all over e^{-λ*50}.

Wait, that's another approach.

So P( decay between 50 and 200 ) is P( decay by 200 ) minus P( decay by 50 ), which is [1 - e^{-λ*200}] - [1 - e^{-λ*50}] = e^{-λ*50} - e^{-λ*200}.

And the denominator is P( no decay in 50 ) which is e^{-λ*50}.

So the conditional probability is [ e^{-λ*50} - e^{-λ*200} ] / e^{-λ*50} } = 1 - e^{-λ*(200-50)} = 1 - e^{-λ*150}.

Which brings us back to the same result as before.

So the calculation is the same; the conditional probability is 1 - e^{-λ*150}, which is approximately 43.9%, so 44% which is A.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A) 44%.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (\( P = 0.32 \)). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \lambda \)
From \( P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \), we have:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.385662 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.385662}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, this is equivalent to calculating the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from the current time.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
P = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To calculate \( e^{-0.5785} \), we approximate it as \( e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561 \). Thus:

\[
P \approx 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The closest option to 43.9% is **44%**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. So the question is about the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes already.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay probability is independent of time, meaning that each atom has a constant probability per unit time of decaying. So the key here is to find the decay constant and then calculate the probability for the remaining time.

Oh, wait, that's close to 0.68. Hmm, maybe my approximation is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I can think that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385. Let me check: e^0.385 is about 1.469. So 1/e^0.385 is 0.681, which is close to 0.68. So λ = 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Wait, actually, for precise calculation, perhaps I should use a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, maybe I can proceed with the approximation.

So λ ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Now, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time we're looking at is 150 minutes more. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the question says that so far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom has not decayed. So the total time from the beginning is 50 minutes, and we're now looking at the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes depends only on the remaining time, not on how long it's been since it started.

Wait, no, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So we're considering the conditional probability. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, but I think I need to compute the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200.

So the probability would be the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but the exponential distribution has the memoryless property. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes starting now. So the conditional probability is P( decay in 150 minutes | no decay in 50 minutes ) = probability of decay in 150 minutes.

But wait, the initial data is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So I think the approach is to find λ from that, and then compute the probability over 150 minutes, but perhaps after 50 minutes have passed.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The initial setup is that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so in other words, in 100 minutes, 32% chance of decay. So using that, we can find λ.

Then, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and no decay, what is the chance that it decays in the next 150 minutes.

But since the decay is memoryless, the probability is the same as if it just started, and we're considering 150 minutes. So P( decay in 150 ) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total time from the start to 200 minutes, but that's not correct because the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, so the probability of decay in the next 150 from t=50 to t=200 is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting at any point.

Wait, but the initial condition is that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which gives us λ. So perhaps the way to approach this is to compute P( decay at any time within 100 minutes) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ*100}, which gives λ as I computed before.

Now, the problem is, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, what is the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., total time from start is 200 minutes). But wait, no, because the memoryless property tells us that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is just P(decay in 150 minutes) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

So using our λ, which is approximately 0.00385 per minute. Let's compute that.

So λ = 0.00385 per minute.

Compute 150 * λ = 150 * 0.00385 = 0.5775.

Then, 1 - e^{-0.5775}.

What is e^{-0.5775}?

I know that e^{-0.5} is about 0.6065, e^{-0.6} is about 0.5488, e^{-0.5775} is somewhere between those. Maybe around 0.561.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Let me think: the value of e^{-0.5775}.

We can approximate it using Taylor series or known values.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator: e^-0.5775 ≈ 0.561.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate it more accurately.

Let me consider x=0.5775.

e^{-x} = 1/(e^{x}).

We can compute e^0.5775:

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872,

e^0.0775 ≈ 1 + 0.0775 + (0.0775)^2/2 + (0.0775)^3/6 + ...

0.0775^2 = 0.006006. Divided by 2 is 0.003003.

0.0775^3 = 0.0004657. Divided by 6 is about 0.0000776.

So e^0.0775 ≈ 1 + 0.0775 + 0.003003 + 0.0000776 ≈ 1.08058.

So e^0.5775 = e^{0.5 + 0.0775} = e^0.5 * e^0.0775 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08058.

Let me compute that: 1.64872 * 1.08058.

Multiply 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

1.64872 * 0.00058 ≈ approx 0.000957.

Adding those: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.000957 ≈ 1.7815746.

So e^0.5775 ≈ 1.78157.

So e^{-0.5775} = 1 / 1.78157 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - e^{-0.5775} ≈ 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%, option B)40%, etc.

Wait, but let me double-check λ because perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, the initial condition: P( decay within 100 minutes ) is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}.

So e^{-100λ} = 0.68.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662.

So 100λ = 0.385662 → λ ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Which gives λ * 150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.

So e^{-0.578493} ≈ ?

Hmm, perhaps better to compute it again.

Let me think, e^{-0.5785}.

Again, let me approximate.

We can consider that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. So 0.5785 is less than ln(2), so e^{-0.5785} is about 0.56.

Alternatively, perhaps a precise calculation:

We can use the Taylor series for e^{-x} around x=0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps think of e^{-0.5785} = 1 / e^{0.5785}.

Compute e^{0.5785}.

What is 0.5785?

It's 0.5 + 0.0785.

So e^{0.5} ≈ 1.64872.

Compute e^{0.0785}.

Using the expansion: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

x = 0.0785.

x² = 0.00616225.

x³ = 0.000483.

x^4 = 0.0000378.

So e^{0.0785} ≈ 1 + 0.0785 + 0.00616225/2 + 0.000483/6 + 0.0000378/24.

Compute each term:

0.0785 is 0.0785.

0.00616225/2 = 0.003081125.

0.000483/6 ≈ 0.0000805.

0.0000378/24 ≈ 0.000001575.

Adding them together:

1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785.

Plus 0.003081125 → 1.081581125.

Plus 0.0000805 → 1.081661625.

Plus 0.000001575 → 1.0816632.

So e^{0.0785} ≈ 1.08166.

So e^{0.5785} = e^{0.5} * e^{0.0785} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08166.

Compute that:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976.

1.64872 * 0.00166 ≈ approx 0.00273.

Add them: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.00273 → ~1.7833476.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.78335.

So e^{-0.5785} = 1/1.78335 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%. 

Looking back at the options, option A is 44%, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A) 44%.

Wait a minute, but wait another thing. Another approach: perhaps the initial 32% is for a 100-minute period, and the question is about 150 minutes. So the total probability for 150 minutes is higher than 32%.

But wait, no. Because the initial 32% is from 0 to 100 minutes. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed. Oh wait, no. Wait, the initial 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. So the decay can happen any time within that 100. Now, when 50 minutes have passed and no decay, the probability of decaying in the next 150 should be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which depends on λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is 44%, which is option A.

But wait, another way to think: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^{-λ*50}.

So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P( decay in 150 | no decay in 50 ) = [P( decay between 50 and 200 ) ] / [ P( no decay in 50 ) ]

Which is [1 - e^{-λ*(200)} ] - [1 - e^{-λ*(50)} ] all over e^{-λ*50}.

Wait, that's another approach.

So P( decay between 50 and 200 ) is P( decay by 200 ) minus P( decay by 50 ), which is [1 - e^{-λ*200}] - [1 - e^{-λ*50}] = e^{-λ*50} - e^{-λ*200}.

And the denominator is P( no decay in 50 ) which is e^{-λ*50}.

So the conditional probability is [ e^{-λ*50} - e^{-λ*200} ] / e^{-λ*50} } = 1 - e^{-λ*(200-50)} = 1 - e^{-λ*150}.

Which brings us back to the same result as before.

So the calculation is the same; the conditional probability is 1 - e^{-λ*150}, which is approximately 43.9%, so 44% which is A.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (\( P = 0.32 \)). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \lambda \)
From \( P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \), we have:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.385662 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.385662}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, this is equivalent to calculating the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from the current time.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
P = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To calculate \( e^{-0.5785} \), we approximate it as \( e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561 \). Thus:

\[
P \approx 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The closest option to 43.9% is **44%**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
