Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to unpack what's being asked.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The setup is in the CERN Bubble Chamber, and they're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all in meters, which suggests we're dealing with some sort of length measurement, probably related to the decay path or something like that.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, the distance it travels before decaying depends on its velocity, lifetime, and energy. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, time dilation comes into play because of relativity. So the observed lifetime (which is longer) would be gamma times the proper lifetime.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m. E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8=27.28, which is a bit over 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is about 7.91.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀. Let me plug in the numbers. 7.91 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's compute that: 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ is approximately 6.328e-15 seconds.

But wait, why do we care about the lifetime? Oh, right, because the particle will travel a certain distance before decaying, and the resolution of the bubble chamber needs to be good enough to detect the decay. The distance the particle travels is v multiplied by τ. Because v is the velocity, and τ is the time.

So the distance L is v * τ. But wait, v is the velocity of the particle. I can find v using the energy. The particle's energy E is given as 27 GeV. The rest mass energy is m*c², which is 3.41 GeV. So, the total energy is E = γ m c², which makes sense.

The velocity v can be found from the relation between energy and momentum. The energy E is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). So, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2. Solving for p, the momentum, gives p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) / c². Wait, maybe it's better to express v in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, the velocity can be found via beta, where beta is v/c. The relation is beta = p c² / E. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the momentum p is gamma m v. Since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So, p = (E / c²) * v. So, v = (p c²) / E. But perhaps another approach is better.

Another way: the kinetic energy K is E - mc². So, K = (gamma -1) mc². But maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, since E = gamma mc², and p = gamma m v, so v = (p c) / (gamma m c²) ) * c²? Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Let's think about beta.

Beta (β) is v/c. From E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²,

We can write (pc)² = E² - (mc²)^2.

So, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) / c.

Wait, but since E is given as 27 GeV, and mc² is 3.41 GeV, let's compute E² and (mc²)^2.

But maybe a better approach is to find beta. Since E = gamma mc² and p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = v/c.

So, p = gamma m beta c.

But E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, substituting p from above,

E² = (gamma m beta c^2 )^2 + (mc²)^2.

Factor out (mc²)^2:

E² = (mc²)^2 [ (gamma beta)^2 + 1 ]

But gamma is E/(mc²), so gamma = E/(mc²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91 as before.

So let's substitute:

[ (gamma beta)^2 + 1 ] = (E^2)/( (mc²)^2 )

Wait, because E = gamma mc², so E^2 = gamma² (mc²)^2.

So, (gamma beta)^2 + 1 = gamma².

Which simplifies to (gamma beta)^2 = gamma² - 1.

Taking square roots, gamma beta = sqrt(gamma² -1).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, because:

gamma² beta² = gamma² -1.

Divide both sides by gamma²:

beta² = 1 - (1/gamma²) → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, gamma is 7.91, so 1/gamma² is approximately 1/(62.56) ≈ 0.016.

So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984. Taking the square root: sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is about 0.992. So v is 0.992 c.

But wait, I should compute this more accurately. Let me calculate gamma squared.

Gamma is 27 / 3.41 = let me compute that precisely.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 *7.9= 23.87 +3.41*0.9= 23.87 +3.069=26.939. Oh, wait, 3.41 *7.91 is 3.41*(7 +0.91)= 23.87 + (3.41 *0.91).

3.41*0.9=3.069, 3.41*0.01=0.0341. So 3.41*0.91=3.069 +0.0341=3.1031. So 23.87 +3.1031=26.9731. Close to 27, so gamma is about 7.91.

So gamma squared is (7.91)^2. Let's compute that.

7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.91^2 = 62.5681. So 1/gamma^2 ≈ 1/62.5681 ≈ 0.016.

So sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 0.016) = sqrt(0.984).

What's sqrt(0.984)? Let's calculate:

0.99^2 is 0.9801, 0.992^2 = (0.99)^2 + 2*(0.99)*(0.002) + (0.002)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004 = ~0.984064. Oh, that's almost exactly 0.984. So sqrt(0.984) is approximately 0.992.

So beta is 0.992. So v = 0.992 c.

So now, back to the distance L that the particle travels before decaying. L = v * τ.

But τ is the dilated lifetime, which is gamma * τ₀. So τ=gamma * 8e-16 s.

So L = v * gamma * τ₀.

Substituting the numbers:

v = 0.992 c ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s.

Gamma is 7.91.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.992 *3e8 m/s * 7.91 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.992 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Then, 7.91 *8e-16 = 63.28e-16 = 6.328e-15 s.

Multiplying 2.976e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s.

Multiply 2.976e8 * 6.328e-15.

2.976 *6.328 ≈ let's compute 3 *6=18, but more accurately,

2.976 *6.328.

Hmm, 2.976 *6 = 17.856.

2.976 *0.328 = approximately 2.976 *0.3=0.8928, 2.976 *0.028=0.083328. So together 0.8928 +0.083328=0.976128.

Adding to 17.856: 17.856 +0.976128 ≈18.832.

So 2.976e8 *6.328e-15 = 18.832e-7. Because 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

18.832e-7 meters is 1.8832e-6 meters, or about 1.883e-6 meters.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the exponents correctly.

Wait, 2.976e8 is 2.976 *1e8, and 6.328e-15 is 6.328*1e-15.

Multiplying them: (2.976 *6.328) * (1e8 *1e-15) )= 18.83 *1e-7.

Because 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

So 18.83 *1e-7 m is 1.883e-6 meters, which is 1.883 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Hmm, I think I need to consider how much of the decay products' paths are detected. If the resolution is the ability to distinguish the decay point, perhaps the minimum distance is when the resolution is such that the particle's decay path is longer than a certain fraction.

Wait, so the proper lifetime is the mean lifetime in the rest frame, and the observed lifetime is longer. The mean path length would be L = gamma v tau_0.

But what about the 30% part? Oh, that probably refers to the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length. Since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that the decay occurs after a certain time is e^(-t/tau). But since we're looking for the minimum resolution, perhaps we're considering the mean lifetime, but adjusted for the 30% efficiency.

Wait, I think the question is about the length that corresponds to 30% of the decays occurring beyond that length, or maybe within that length. Hmm, need to think.

Wait, the number of decays that have occurred by time t is N = 1 - e^(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime. So, for 30% of the decays, that's when N=0.3.

So, 0.3 = 1 - e^(-t/tau) → e^(-t/tau) = 0.7 → -t/tau = ln(0.7) → t = -tau * ln(0.7)

Wait, ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. So t = tau * 0.3567.

So the time t for 30% of decays would be about 35.67% of the mean lifetime.

But wait, the distance L would be v * t. So L = v * tau * 0.3567.

Wait, earlier we found L to be gamma*v*tau_0, which is the mean path length. So the mean path is L_mean = gamma*v*tau_0 = v*tau, since tau=gamma tau_0.

So, for 30% of decays, the distance would be L = v * t = v * tau * 0.3567. Or more precisely, L = v * tau * ( -ln(0.7) )

But wait, let me compute this correctly.

The probability that the decay occurs before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/tau). So if we want 30% of decays to be observed, that's when P=0.3. So,

0.3 = 1 - e^(-t/tau) → e^(-t/tau) = 0.7 → t = -tau * ln(0.7).

Compute ln(0.7) → Approximately -0.35667.

So t = 0.35667 * tau.

Thus, the distance is L = v * t = v * 0.35667 * tau.

But tau is gamma * tau_0, so tau = gamma tau_0.

So,

L = v * 0.35667 * gamma tau_0.

But v is beta c, so substituting,

L = beta c * 0.35667 * gamma tau_0.

But gamma = E / (m c²) → gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) = 7.91 as before.

So,

L = beta * c * 0.35667 * gamma * tau_0.

We can compute this:

beta ≈ 0.992, c=3e8 m/s, gamma=7.91, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 0.35667 *7.91 *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *3e8 → approx 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 0.35667: 2.976e8 * 0.35667 ≈ 1.063e8 m/s.

Multiply by 7.91: 1.063e8 *7.91 ≈ approx 8.42e8.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 8.42e8 *8e-16 = 6.736e-7 meters.

Wait, 8.42e8 *8e-16 = (8.42 *8) *1e8 *1e-16 = 67.36 *1e-8 = 6.736e-7 meters.

So that's 6.736e-7 meters, which is approximately 673.6 nanometers or about 0.67 micrometers.

But wait, earlier when I computed the mean path length, I got about 1.88e-6 meters (1.88 micrometers). So 0.67e-6 meters is about 35% of that, which makes sense because we're looking for the point where 30% of decays have occurred beyond that point.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The probability P is the probability that the decay has occurred by time t. So, for P=0.3, the decay has happened in 30% of the cases by time t. So, the distance L = v t would be such that the particle has a 30% chance of decaying beyond that point. Wait, no, I think I got it wrong.

Wait, no. If the decay occurs at time t, and the probability that the decay happens before t is P=0.3, then the distance L = v t corresponds to a 30% chance of decaying within that distance. So, the length that the particle has to travel for 30% of the decays to happen beyond that length is when P=0.7. Because P is the probability that the decay has happened by time t. So, if we want 30% of the decays to be beyond L, that would mean 70% have decayed by L, so P=0.7.

Ah, right! Because if 70% have decayed by L, then 30% are still intact, meaning they have not decayed yet, and would travel beyond L. So, the correct approach is to find t such that P = 0.7 (70% decayed before t), leaving 30% to decay after t.

So, correct computation would be:

0.7 = 1 - e^(-t/tau).

So, e^(-t/tau) = 0.3.

Then, t = -tau * ln(0.3).

Compute ln(0.3) → approximately -1.20397.

So, t = tau * 1.20397.

So, the distance L is v * t = v * tau * 1.20397.

But tau is gamma * tau_0.

So,

L = v * gamma * tau_0 *1.20397.

Which is 1.20397 times the mean path length.

Earlier, the mean path was about 1.88e-6 m. So 1.2 times that is approximately 2.26e-6 m.

Wait, but let's compute it accurately.

Compute L = beta c * gamma tau_0 * 1.20397.

beta =0.992, c=3e8, gamma=7.91, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

beta c = 0.992 *3e8 = ~2.976e8 m/s.

gamma tau_0 =7.91 *8e-16 =6.328e-15 s.

Multiply these: 2.976e8 m/s *6.328e-15 s = 2.976 *6.328e-7 m.

Wait, 2.976*6.328 ≈ 18.83.

So, 18.83e-7 m = 1.883e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.883e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.267e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.27e-6 meters, or 2.27 micrometers.

Wait, but the options are 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, why is there a discrepancy?

Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the factors. Let me go back.

First, compute gamma:

gamma = E / (m c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 27/3.41 ≈7.915.

So gamma =7.915.

Compute beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - ( (3.41)^2 )/(27^2) )

3.41 squared is about 11.63. 27 squared is 729.

So 11.63/729 ≈0.01595. 1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.992.

So beta is 0.992.

Now, tau = gamma * tau_0 =7.915 *8e-16 =63.32e-16 =6.332e-15 s.

L = v * tau = beta c * tau.

v = beta c =0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

So L=2.976e8 m/s *6.332e-15 s.

2.976e8 *6.332e-15 = (2.976 *6.332) * (1e8 *1e-15) )= (18.83) *1e-7=1.883e-6 m.

Wait, but this is the mean path length, which is the average distance. So, for 30% of the decays, the particles would have to travel beyond the minimum resolution, which is the L where 70% have decayed (so 30% are left to decay beyond this point).

So, the correct L for 30% is when 70% have decayed, which is when t is such that P=0.7.

So, t = tau * ln(1/(1-0.7)) = tau * ln(1/0.3) ≈ tau *1.20397.

So, L = v*t = v * tau *1.20397.

Which is 1.20397 * mean path length.

Mean path is 1.883e-6 m, so 1.20397 *1.883e-6 = approximately 2.267e-6 m.

Hmm, but the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done without considering the 30% part, and the question is simply about the mean path, but the options don't match exactly.

Wait, let's recompute the L without the 30% factor. So, the mean path is 1.883e-6 meters, but none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me redo the exact computation.

Compute gamma more accurately:

gamma =27 / 3.41 = let's compute 27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×7.91 = 23.87 + (3.41 ×0.91) =23.87 + 3.1031=26.9731.

So, 27 /3.41 =7.915 approx.

Now, beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

(3.41)^2=11.6281.

27²=729.

So 11.6281/729 ≈0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920.

So beta=0.992.

tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16 s=63.32e-16=6.332e-15 s.

v=beta c=0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

Mean L= v*tau=2.976e8 *6.332e-15 = let me compute 2.976 *6.332 = ?

2.976 ×6 is 17.856.

2.976 ×0.332 = approx 0.988.

Total is 17.856 +0.988=18.844.

So 18.844e-7 m=1.8844e-6 m, which is about 1.884 micrometers.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the L for the 30% case.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of decays are observed. So perhaps the minimum distance is when the decay is detected at least 30% of the time.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So, perhaps it's the distance such that when the decay happens beyond that point, it's detected. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolution is the ability to measure the decay point, so the minimum detectable distance is when the decay has occurred, and the resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured. So, if the decay occurs at a point, the resolution must be able to pinpoint it within a certain accuracy.

Wait, perhaps I was overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the mean decay length, and the minimum resolution is that length. So, why is the number I got (1.88e-6 m) not matching any option, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let's recompute gamma.

gamma =27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 ×7.915:

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×0.9=3.069.

3.41 ×0.015=0.05115.

So 23.87 +3.069 +0.05115=26.98915.

But 3.41 ×7.915 is a bit more than 27.

Wait, 3.41 ×7.915=3.41*(7 +0.915)=3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.915=3.41*(0.9+0.015)=3.069 +0.05115=3.12015.

So total is 23.87 +3.12015=26.99015.

So 27 /3.41=7.915 approx.

So gamma=7.915.

Compute beta again.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729= approx 0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920.

So, to compute L accurately:

beta=0.992.

tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16=63.32e-16 s=6.332e-15 s.

v=beta*c=0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

L= v * tau=2.976e8 *6.332e-15 = compute this.

2.976e8 is 297600000 m/s.

6.332e-15 s.

Multiply: 297600000 m/s *6.332e-15 s = 297600000 *6.332e-15 m.

Calculate 297600000 *6.332e-15.

297600000 is 2.976e8.

2.976e8 *6.332e-15= (2.976 *6.332) * (1e8 *1e-15)= 18.84 *1e-7=1.884e-6 m.

So L=1.884e-6 m or 1.884 micrometers.

But the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives 1.884e-6 m, which is about 1.88 micrometers. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

But why is there a discrepancy? Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the resolution is the distance that 30% of the decays have occurred beyond, which would require a longer L.

Wait, earlier I thought that to have 30% of decays beyond a certain L, the time t would need to be such that 70% have decayed, leading to a longer L than the mean. Let me recalculate that.

Compute L for 70% decayed.

t = tau * ln(1/(1-0.7))=tau * ln(1/0.3)=tau *1.20397.

So L= v * t =v * 1.20397 * tau.

But tau=gamma tau_0.

So,

L= v * gamma tau_0 *1.20397.

Which is 1.20397 times the mean L.

Mean L is 1.884e-6 m, so 1.20397 *1.884e-6 ≈?

1.884e-6 *1.2 →2.26e-6.

But 1.20397 is about 1.204, so 1.884e-6 *1.204 ≈2.269e-6 m.

Which is 2.269 micrometers.

But the options don't have this either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the minimum resolution as the distance where 30% of the decays are observed, which might correspond to the mean path multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, another approach: the resolution must be sufficient to see the decay, so the decay must occur within the chamber. But perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum path length that allows 30% of the particles to decay, which would be when the length is such that P=0.3, so 30% have decayed, and 70% are left. Wait, no, that's not right. Because P is the probability of decay by time t. So P=0.3 implies 30% have decayed, and 70% are still intact. So the decay occurs within L for 30% of the particles. But the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, meaning that the detector must be able to see the decay point. So, the distance the particle travels before decaying must be such that it's possible to measure where it happened. So perhaps the minimum distance is the mean decay length multiplied by a factor that depends on the detection efficiency.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to compute the mean decay length, which is gamma v tau_0, and the options given have 2.08e-6 m, which is perhaps a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

gamma is 7.915.

So tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16=63.32e-16 s =6.332e-15 s.

v= beta c=0.992 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

So L= v * tau = 2.976e8 m/s *6.332e-15 s.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.332e-15.

2.976 *6.332= approx 18.84.

1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

So 18.84e-7 m=1.884e-6 m.

Which is 1.884 micrometers.

But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value for gamma and beta.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma=27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 *7.915.

Compute 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.915=3.41*(0.9+0.015)=3.069 + 0.05115=3.12015.

So 23.87 +3.12015=26.99015.

Which is just under 27, so gamma is approximately 7.915.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise beta.

Compute beta= sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

m=3.41 GeV/c², E=27 GeV.

So,

(m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2.

E²=27²=729 (GeV)^2.

So (m c²)^2= (3.41)^2=11.6281.

Thus,

beta= sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729 )=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So, beta=0.9920.

So,

v=0.9920 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

tau=7.915 *8e-16=6.332e-15 s.

L=2.976e8 *6.332e-15= ?

Compute 2.976e8 *6.332e-15:

(2.976 *6.332) *1e-7 = (18.84) *1e-7 =1.884e-6 m.

Hmm, same result.

So, none of the options match exactly. Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the minimum detectable distance, which is when the detection is possible. For a detector, the resolution is the smallest distance it can measure. But perhaps the question is considering the average distance, and the options have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta or gamma.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma=27/3.41.

3.41 ×7.915.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 27 ÷3.41.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 × 7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 ÷3.41= approximately 0.917.

So 7.917.

Wait, 3.41 ×7.917=?

3.41 ×7=23.87.

3.41 ×0.917=3.41*(0.9 +0.017)=3.069 + 0.05797=3.12697.

Total: 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697.

So, 3.41 *7.917=26.99697, which is very close to 27. So gamma=7.917.

So, more accurately, gamma=7.917.

Now, beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41)^2/(27^2)).

(3.41)^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

So,

beta= sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729)=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So, same as before.

Now, computing L:

v=0.9920 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

tau=gamma *tau_0=7.917 *8e-16=63.336e-16=6.3336e-15 s.

L= v * tau=2.976e8 *6.3336e-15.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15.

Multiply 2.976 *6.3336=?

2.976 *6=17.856.

2.976 *0.3336=approx 2.976 *0.3=0.8928, 2.976 *0.0336=0.1002. So total 0.8928 +0.1002=0.993.

So total 17.856 +0.993=18.849.

So 18.849e-7 m=1.8849e-6 m.

Still about 1.885 micrometers.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, the closest is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the 30% part. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum resolution in terms of the decay length being within the detection volume. So, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution must be such that the decay occurs within a distance L, leading to 30% of the particles decaying within L.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the probability of decaying within L is P=1 -e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L such that P=0.3, which is 30% of the particles have decayed by that distance. So, 30% have decayed, 70% are left.

So,

0.3 =1 -e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} → e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}=0.7 → -L/(gamma beta c tau_0)=ln(0.7) → L= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7).

Wait, ln(0.7)= -0.35667.

So,

L= gamma beta c tau_0 *0.35667.

Wait, but that would give a shorter L than the mean path.

Hmm, because if L is such that 30% have decayed, then the mean decay length is gamma beta c tau_0, and 30% is a fraction of that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate L such that P=0.3, which is the point where 30% of the particles have decayed, and 70% are still alive.

So,

L = gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3))=gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/0.7) ≈ gamma beta c tau_0 *0.35667.

So,

L=0.35667 * gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, but gamma beta c tau_0 is the same as (gamma beta c) tau_0.

Wait, gamma beta c = (E/(m c²)) * beta c.

Wait, but E=gamma m c², so gamma beta c = (E/(m c²)) * (v) = (E/(m c²)) * (beta c) = (E beta c) / (m c²) )= E beta/(m c).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute L as:

L = gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Which is,

L=7.917 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *0.35667.

Compute step by step.

First, compute gamma beta: 7.917 *0.992=approx 7.86.

So,

7.86 *3e8=2.358e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.358e9 *8e-16 = (2.358 *8) *1e-7=18.864e-7 m=1.8864e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.35667: 1.8864e-6 *0.35667≈0.673e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

Which is about 0.673 micrometers.

But that's way below the options. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean path length multiplied by a factor involving the 30% efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean path length, and option A is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0 * (gamma factor) but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, reviewing all, perhaps the initial approach was correct. The minimum resolution needed is the mean decay length, which is L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

So,

gamma=7.915,

beta=0.992,

c=3e8 m/s,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L=7.915 *0.992 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute step by step.

7.915 *0.992 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8=2.358e9.

Multiply by8e-16: 2.358e9 *8e-16= (2.358 *8 ) *1e-7=18.864e-7=1.8864e-6 m.

Which is 1.8864 micrometers.

The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, where does 2.08 come from?

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×0.917=3.13 (since 3.41 ×0.9=3.069, 3.41×0.017=0.05797 → total 3.12697 ≈3.13).

So, gamma=7.917.

Then,

gamma * beta =7.917 *0.992≈7.86.

Now,

L=7.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.86 *3=23.58.

23.58e8 *8e-16=23.58 *8 *1e-8=188.64e-8=1.8864e-6 m.

Still 1.8864e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 27 GeV/c², not GeV. No, the problem states energy is 27 GeV, which is kinetic plus rest mass. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation uses the velocity as c, assuming beta is approximately 1. So, beta=c, but that would give a higher L.

So,

L=gamma *c *tau_0.

Gamma=7.915,

c=3e8,

tau_0=8e-16.

So,

L=7.915 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.915 *3=23.745.

23.745e8 *8e-16=23.745 *8 *1e-8=189.96e-8=1.8996e-6 m.

Still around 1.9e-6 m. Closer to 2e-6 m, which is option A (2.08e-6 m).

But why 2.08?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma and beta gives a slightly higher value.

Let me compute gamma with more precision.

gamma=27/3.41 =7.915 exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute beta more accurately.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41)^2/(27)^2).

Compute 3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01595035.

1 -0.01595035=0.98404965.

sqrt(0.98404965)=0.9920194.

So beta=0.9920194.

So,

L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.915,

beta=0.9920194,

c=3e8,

tau_0=8e-16.

Compute:

7.915 *0.9920194 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8=2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16=1.8864e-6 m.

Still the same.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Perhaps the question is not about the 30% of decays, but about the minimum resolution needed to observe the decay, which is the minimum distance the particle travels. So, the minimum would be when the decay occurs at the earliest possible time, but that's not physics since the decay is a Poisson process.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the minimum distance for 30% of the decays to have happened. So, the L computed as 1.88e-6 m would be the average, and to capture 30% of the decays, you need a longer L.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, the closest is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, 2.08e-6 is approximately 2.08 micrometers, which is about 10% higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using exact numbers.

Compute 27/3.41=7.915.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2))= sqrt(1 - (11.6281)/729)=sqrt(0.98404965)= approx 0.9920194.

So,

gamma * beta =7.915 *0.9920194=7.86.

L=7.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

Wait, 7.86 *3e8=2.358e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.358e9 *8e-16=1.8864e-6 m.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using c=3e8 m/s, but perhaps I should use more precise value, like 2.998e8 m/s.

Let me try that.

beta=0.9920194.

v=beta*c=0.9920194 *2.998e8 ≈2.975e8 m/s.

tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16=6.332e-15 s.

L= v * tau=2.975e8 *6.332e-15= (2.975 *6.332) *1e-7.

2.975 *6=17.85.

2.975 *0.332=0.987.

Total:17.85+0.987=18.837.

18.837e-7=1.8837e-6 m.

Still around 1.884 micrometers.

I think the correct calculation leads to L≈1.88e-6 m, but the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation without considering the 30% part, and just the mean path.

Wait, perhaps I completely misunderstood the question. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure. So, for a particle to decay, the detector must be able to see the decay point. So, the minimum resolution is the mean path length divided by some factor.

Wait, no, I think the question is asking for the minimum spatial resolution (like the smallest detail the detector can see) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the decay must be resolvable within that distance. So, perhaps the minimum is the mean path length multiplied by a factor based on the efficiency.

But I'm not exactly sure. Given the options, I think the intended answer is A) 2.08e-6 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the distance the particle travels before decaying. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The energy of the particle is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Velocity (\( v \)):**
   The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relation \( \beta = v/c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \):
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{(27)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{11.6281}{729}} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
   \]
   Thus, \( v = \beta c \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Dilated Lifetime (\( \tau \)):**
   The dilated lifetime is given by \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \tau = 7.915 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} = 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Path Length (\( L_{\text{mean}} \)):**
   The mean distance traveled by the particle before decaying is:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = v \tau = (2.976 \times 10^8) \times (6.332 \times 10^{-15}) \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.884 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]

5. **Distance for 30% Decays:**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the distance \( L \) must account for the exponential decay probability. The time \( t \) corresponding to 30% of the decays is determined using:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-t/\tau}, \quad P = 0.3 \implies t = -\tau \ln(0.7)
   \]
   Substituting \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.35667 \):
   \[
   t = \tau \times 0.35667
   \]
   The corresponding distance is:
   \[
   L = v t = v \tau \times 0.35667 = 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.35667 \approx 6.73 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \, (0.673 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]
   However, this result is inconsistent with the options provided, suggesting the question may instead refer to the mean path length or a related factor.

### Conclusion:
The closest option to the calculated mean decay path length (\( L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.884 \, \mu\text{m} \)) is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to unpack what's being asked.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The setup is in the CERN Bubble Chamber, and they're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all in meters, which suggests we're dealing with some sort of length measurement, probably related to the decay path or something like that.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, the distance it travels before decaying depends on its velocity, lifetime, and energy. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, time dilation comes into play because of relativity. So the observed lifetime (which is longer) would be gamma times the proper lifetime.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m. E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8=27.28, which is a bit over 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is about 7.91.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀. Let me plug in the numbers. 7.91 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's compute that: 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ is approximately 6.328e-15 seconds.

But wait, why do we care about the lifetime? Oh, right, because the particle will travel a certain distance before decaying, and the resolution of the bubble chamber needs to be good enough to detect the decay. The distance the particle travels is v multiplied by τ. Because v is the velocity, and τ is the time.

So the distance L is v * τ. But wait, v is the velocity of the particle. I can find v using the energy. The particle's energy E is given as 27 GeV. The rest mass energy is m*c², which is 3.41 GeV. So, the total energy is E = γ m c², which makes sense.

The velocity v can be found from the relation between energy and momentum. The energy E is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). So, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2. Solving for p, the momentum, gives p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) / c². Wait, maybe it's better to express v in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, the velocity can be found via beta, where beta is v/c. The relation is beta = p c² / E. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the momentum p is gamma m v. Since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So, p = (E / c²) * v. So, v = (p c²) / E. But perhaps another approach is better.

Another way: the kinetic energy K is E - mc². So, K = (gamma -1) mc². But maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, since E = gamma mc², and p = gamma m v, so v = (p c) / (gamma m c²) ) * c²? Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Let's think about beta.

Beta (β) is v/c. From E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²,

We can write (pc)² = E² - (mc²)^2.

So, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) / c.

Wait, but since E is given as 27 GeV, and mc² is 3.41 GeV, let's compute E² and (mc²)^2.

But maybe a better approach is to find beta. Since E = gamma mc² and p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = v/c.

So, p = gamma m beta c.

But E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, substituting p from above,

E² = (gamma m beta c^2 )^2 + (mc²)^2.

Factor out (mc²)^2:

E² = (mc²)^2 [ (gamma beta)^2 + 1 ]

But gamma is E/(mc²), so gamma = E/(mc²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91 as before.

So let's substitute:

[ (gamma beta)^2 + 1 ] = (E^2)/( (mc²)^2 )

Wait, because E = gamma mc², so E^2 = gamma² (mc²)^2.

So, (gamma beta)^2 + 1 = gamma².

Which simplifies to (gamma beta)^2 = gamma² - 1.

Taking square roots, gamma beta = sqrt(gamma² -1).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, because:

gamma² beta² = gamma² -1.

Divide both sides by gamma²:

beta² = 1 - (1/gamma²) → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, gamma is 7.91, so 1/gamma² is approximately 1/(62.56) ≈ 0.016.

So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984. Taking the square root: sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is about 0.992. So v is 0.992 c.

But wait, I should compute this more accurately. Let me calculate gamma squared.

Gamma is 27 / 3.41 = let me compute that precisely.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 *7.9= 23.87 +3.41*0.9= 23.87 +3.069=26.939. Oh, wait, 3.41 *7.91 is 3.41*(7 +0.91)= 23.87 + (3.41 *0.91).

3.41*0.9=3.069, 3.41*0.01=0.0341. So 3.41*0.91=3.069 +0.0341=3.1031. So 23.87 +3.1031=26.9731. Close to 27, so gamma is about 7.91.

So gamma squared is (7.91)^2. Let's compute that.

7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.91^2 = 62.5681. So 1/gamma^2 ≈ 1/62.5681 ≈ 0.016.

So sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 0.016) = sqrt(0.984).

What's sqrt(0.984)? Let's calculate:

0.99^2 is 0.9801, 0.992^2 = (0.99)^2 + 2*(0.99)*(0.002) + (0.002)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004 = ~0.984064. Oh, that's almost exactly 0.984. So sqrt(0.984) is approximately 0.992.

So beta is 0.992. So v = 0.992 c.

So now, back to the distance L that the particle travels before decaying. L = v * τ.

But τ is the dilated lifetime, which is gamma * τ₀. So τ=gamma * 8e-16 s.

So L = v * gamma * τ₀.

Substituting the numbers:

v = 0.992 c ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s.

Gamma is 7.91.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.992 *3e8 m/s * 7.91 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.992 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Then, 7.91 *8e-16 = 63.28e-16 = 6.328e-15 s.

Multiplying 2.976e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s.

Multiply 2.976e8 * 6.328e-15.

2.976 *6.328 ≈ let's compute 3 *6=18, but more accurately,

2.976 *6.328.

Hmm, 2.976 *6 = 17.856.

2.976 *0.328 = approximately 2.976 *0.3=0.8928, 2.976 *0.028=0.083328. So together 0.8928 +0.083328=0.976128.

Adding to 17.856: 17.856 +0.976128 ≈18.832.

So 2.976e8 *6.328e-15 = 18.832e-7. Because 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

18.832e-7 meters is 1.8832e-6 meters, or about 1.883e-6 meters.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the exponents correctly.

Wait, 2.976e8 is 2.976 *1e8, and 6.328e-15 is 6.328*1e-15.

Multiplying them: (2.976 *6.328) * (1e8 *1e-15) )= 18.83 *1e-7.

Because 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

So 18.83 *1e-7 m is 1.883e-6 meters, which is 1.883 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Hmm, I think I need to consider how much of the decay products' paths are detected. If the resolution is the ability to distinguish the decay point, perhaps the minimum distance is when the resolution is such that the particle's decay path is longer than a certain fraction.

Wait, so the proper lifetime is the mean lifetime in the rest frame, and the observed lifetime is longer. The mean path length would be L = gamma v tau_0.

But what about the 30% part? Oh, that probably refers to the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length. Since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that the decay occurs after a certain time is e^(-t/tau). But since we're looking for the minimum resolution, perhaps we're considering the mean lifetime, but adjusted for the 30% efficiency.

Wait, I think the question is about the length that corresponds to 30% of the decays occurring beyond that length, or maybe within that length. Hmm, need to think.

Wait, the number of decays that have occurred by time t is N = 1 - e^(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime. So, for 30% of the decays, that's when N=0.3.

So, 0.3 = 1 - e^(-t/tau) → e^(-t/tau) = 0.7 → -t/tau = ln(0.7) → t = -tau * ln(0.7)

Wait, ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. So t = tau * 0.3567.

So the time t for 30% of decays would be about 35.67% of the mean lifetime.

But wait, the distance L would be v * t. So L = v * tau * 0.3567.

Wait, earlier we found L to be gamma*v*tau_0, which is the mean path length. So the mean path is L_mean = gamma*v*tau_0 = v*tau, since tau=gamma tau_0.

So, for 30% of decays, the distance would be L = v * t = v * tau * 0.3567. Or more precisely, L = v * tau * ( -ln(0.7) )

But wait, let me compute this correctly.

The probability that the decay occurs before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/tau). So if we want 30% of decays to be observed, that's when P=0.3. So,

0.3 = 1 - e^(-t/tau) → e^(-t/tau) = 0.7 → t = -tau * ln(0.7).

Compute ln(0.7) → Approximately -0.35667.

So t = 0.35667 * tau.

Thus, the distance is L = v * t = v * 0.35667 * tau.

But tau is gamma * tau_0, so tau = gamma tau_0.

So,

L = v * 0.35667 * gamma tau_0.

But v is beta c, so substituting,

L = beta c * 0.35667 * gamma tau_0.

But gamma = E / (m c²) → gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) = 7.91 as before.

So,

L = beta * c * 0.35667 * gamma * tau_0.

We can compute this:

beta ≈ 0.992, c=3e8 m/s, gamma=7.91, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 0.35667 *7.91 *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *3e8 → approx 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 0.35667: 2.976e8 * 0.35667 ≈ 1.063e8 m/s.

Multiply by 7.91: 1.063e8 *7.91 ≈ approx 8.42e8.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 8.42e8 *8e-16 = 6.736e-7 meters.

Wait, 8.42e8 *8e-16 = (8.42 *8) *1e8 *1e-16 = 67.36 *1e-8 = 6.736e-7 meters.

So that's 6.736e-7 meters, which is approximately 673.6 nanometers or about 0.67 micrometers.

But wait, earlier when I computed the mean path length, I got about 1.88e-6 meters (1.88 micrometers). So 0.67e-6 meters is about 35% of that, which makes sense because we're looking for the point where 30% of decays have occurred beyond that point.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The probability P is the probability that the decay has occurred by time t. So, for P=0.3, the decay has happened in 30% of the cases by time t. So, the distance L = v t would be such that the particle has a 30% chance of decaying beyond that point. Wait, no, I think I got it wrong.

Wait, no. If the decay occurs at time t, and the probability that the decay happens before t is P=0.3, then the distance L = v t corresponds to a 30% chance of decaying within that distance. So, the length that the particle has to travel for 30% of the decays to happen beyond that length is when P=0.7. Because P is the probability that the decay has happened by time t. So, if we want 30% of the decays to be beyond L, that would mean 70% have decayed by L, so P=0.7.

Ah, right! Because if 70% have decayed by L, then 30% are still intact, meaning they have not decayed yet, and would travel beyond L. So, the correct approach is to find t such that P = 0.7 (70% decayed before t), leaving 30% to decay after t.

So, correct computation would be:

0.7 = 1 - e^(-t/tau).

So, e^(-t/tau) = 0.3.

Then, t = -tau * ln(0.3).

Compute ln(0.3) → approximately -1.20397.

So, t = tau * 1.20397.

So, the distance L is v * t = v * tau * 1.20397.

But tau is gamma * tau_0.

So,

L = v * gamma * tau_0 *1.20397.

Which is 1.20397 times the mean path length.

Earlier, the mean path was about 1.88e-6 m. So 1.2 times that is approximately 2.26e-6 m.

Wait, but let's compute it accurately.

Compute L = beta c * gamma tau_0 * 1.20397.

beta =0.992, c=3e8, gamma=7.91, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

beta c = 0.992 *3e8 = ~2.976e8 m/s.

gamma tau_0 =7.91 *8e-16 =6.328e-15 s.

Multiply these: 2.976e8 m/s *6.328e-15 s = 2.976 *6.328e-7 m.

Wait, 2.976*6.328 ≈ 18.83.

So, 18.83e-7 m = 1.883e-6 m.

Multiply by 1.20397: 1.883e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.267e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.27e-6 meters, or 2.27 micrometers.

Wait, but the options are 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, why is there a discrepancy?

Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the factors. Let me go back.

First, compute gamma:

gamma = E / (m c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 27/3.41 ≈7.915.

So gamma =7.915.

Compute beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - ( (3.41)^2 )/(27^2) )

3.41 squared is about 11.63. 27 squared is 729.

So 11.63/729 ≈0.01595. 1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.992.

So beta is 0.992.

Now, tau = gamma * tau_0 =7.915 *8e-16 =63.32e-16 =6.332e-15 s.

L = v * tau = beta c * tau.

v = beta c =0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

So L=2.976e8 m/s *6.332e-15 s.

2.976e8 *6.332e-15 = (2.976 *6.332) * (1e8 *1e-15) )= (18.83) *1e-7=1.883e-6 m.

Wait, but this is the mean path length, which is the average distance. So, for 30% of the decays, the particles would have to travel beyond the minimum resolution, which is the L where 70% have decayed (so 30% are left to decay beyond this point).

So, the correct L for 30% is when 70% have decayed, which is when t is such that P=0.7.

So, t = tau * ln(1/(1-0.7)) = tau * ln(1/0.3) ≈ tau *1.20397.

So, L = v*t = v * tau *1.20397.

Which is 1.20397 * mean path length.

Mean path is 1.883e-6 m, so 1.20397 *1.883e-6 = approximately 2.267e-6 m.

Hmm, but the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done without considering the 30% part, and the question is simply about the mean path, but the options don't match exactly.

Wait, let's recompute the L without the 30% factor. So, the mean path is 1.883e-6 meters, but none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me redo the exact computation.

Compute gamma more accurately:

gamma =27 / 3.41 = let's compute 27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×7.91 = 23.87 + (3.41 ×0.91) =23.87 + 3.1031=26.9731.

So, 27 /3.41 =7.915 approx.

Now, beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

(3.41)^2=11.6281.

27²=729.

So 11.6281/729 ≈0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920.

So beta=0.992.

tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16 s=63.32e-16=6.332e-15 s.

v=beta c=0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

Mean L= v*tau=2.976e8 *6.332e-15 = let me compute 2.976 *6.332 = ?

2.976 ×6 is 17.856.

2.976 ×0.332 = approx 0.988.

Total is 17.856 +0.988=18.844.

So 18.844e-7 m=1.8844e-6 m, which is about 1.884 micrometers.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the L for the 30% case.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of decays are observed. So perhaps the minimum distance is when the decay is detected at least 30% of the time.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So, perhaps it's the distance such that when the decay happens beyond that point, it's detected. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolution is the ability to measure the decay point, so the minimum detectable distance is when the decay has occurred, and the resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured. So, if the decay occurs at a point, the resolution must be able to pinpoint it within a certain accuracy.

Wait, perhaps I was overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the mean decay length, and the minimum resolution is that length. So, why is the number I got (1.88e-6 m) not matching any option, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let's recompute gamma.

gamma =27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 ×7.915:

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

3.41 ×0.9=3.069.

3.41 ×0.015=0.05115.

So 23.87 +3.069 +0.05115=26.98915.

But 3.41 ×7.915 is a bit more than 27.

Wait, 3.41 ×7.915=3.41*(7 +0.915)=3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.915=3.41*(0.9+0.015)=3.069 +0.05115=3.12015.

So total is 23.87 +3.12015=26.99015.

So 27 /3.41=7.915 approx.

So gamma=7.915.

Compute beta again.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729= approx 0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920.

So, to compute L accurately:

beta=0.992.

tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16=63.32e-16 s=6.332e-15 s.

v=beta*c=0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

L= v * tau=2.976e8 *6.332e-15 = compute this.

2.976e8 is 297600000 m/s.

6.332e-15 s.

Multiply: 297600000 m/s *6.332e-15 s = 297600000 *6.332e-15 m.

Calculate 297600000 *6.332e-15.

297600000 is 2.976e8.

2.976e8 *6.332e-15= (2.976 *6.332) * (1e8 *1e-15)= 18.84 *1e-7=1.884e-6 m.

So L=1.884e-6 m or 1.884 micrometers.

But the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives 1.884e-6 m, which is about 1.88 micrometers. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

But why is there a discrepancy? Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the resolution is the distance that 30% of the decays have occurred beyond, which would require a longer L.

Wait, earlier I thought that to have 30% of decays beyond a certain L, the time t would need to be such that 70% have decayed, leading to a longer L than the mean. Let me recalculate that.

Compute L for 70% decayed.

t = tau * ln(1/(1-0.7))=tau * ln(1/0.3)=tau *1.20397.

So L= v * t =v * 1.20397 * tau.

But tau=gamma tau_0.

So,

L= v * gamma tau_0 *1.20397.

Which is 1.20397 times the mean L.

Mean L is 1.884e-6 m, so 1.20397 *1.884e-6 ≈?

1.884e-6 *1.2 →2.26e-6.

But 1.20397 is about 1.204, so 1.884e-6 *1.204 ≈2.269e-6 m.

Which is 2.269 micrometers.

But the options don't have this either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the minimum resolution as the distance where 30% of the decays are observed, which might correspond to the mean path multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, another approach: the resolution must be sufficient to see the decay, so the decay must occur within the chamber. But perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum path length that allows 30% of the particles to decay, which would be when the length is such that P=0.3, so 30% have decayed, and 70% are left. Wait, no, that's not right. Because P is the probability of decay by time t. So P=0.3 implies 30% have decayed, and 70% are still intact. So the decay occurs within L for 30% of the particles. But the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, meaning that the detector must be able to see the decay point. So, the distance the particle travels before decaying must be such that it's possible to measure where it happened. So perhaps the minimum distance is the mean decay length multiplied by a factor that depends on the detection efficiency.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to compute the mean decay length, which is gamma v tau_0, and the options given have 2.08e-6 m, which is perhaps a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

gamma is 7.915.

So tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16=63.32e-16 s =6.332e-15 s.

v= beta c=0.992 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

So L= v * tau = 2.976e8 m/s *6.332e-15 s.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.332e-15.

2.976 *6.332= approx 18.84.

1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

So 18.84e-7 m=1.884e-6 m.

Which is 1.884 micrometers.

But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value for gamma and beta.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma=27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 *7.915.

Compute 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.915=3.41*(0.9+0.015)=3.069 + 0.05115=3.12015.

So 23.87 +3.12015=26.99015.

Which is just under 27, so gamma is approximately 7.915.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise beta.

Compute beta= sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

m=3.41 GeV/c², E=27 GeV.

So,

(m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2.

E²=27²=729 (GeV)^2.

So (m c²)^2= (3.41)^2=11.6281.

Thus,

beta= sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729 )=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So, beta=0.9920.

So,

v=0.9920 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

tau=7.915 *8e-16=6.332e-15 s.

L=2.976e8 *6.332e-15= ?

Compute 2.976e8 *6.332e-15:

(2.976 *6.332) *1e-7 = (18.84) *1e-7 =1.884e-6 m.

Hmm, same result.

So, none of the options match exactly. Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the minimum detectable distance, which is when the detection is possible. For a detector, the resolution is the smallest distance it can measure. But perhaps the question is considering the average distance, and the options have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta or gamma.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma=27/3.41.

3.41 ×7.915.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 27 ÷3.41.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 × 7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 ÷3.41= approximately 0.917.

So 7.917.

Wait, 3.41 ×7.917=?

3.41 ×7=23.87.

3.41 ×0.917=3.41*(0.9 +0.017)=3.069 + 0.05797=3.12697.

Total: 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697.

So, 3.41 *7.917=26.99697, which is very close to 27. So gamma=7.917.

So, more accurately, gamma=7.917.

Now, beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41)^2/(27^2)).

(3.41)^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

So,

beta= sqrt(1 - 11.6281/729)=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So, same as before.

Now, computing L:

v=0.9920 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

tau=gamma *tau_0=7.917 *8e-16=63.336e-16=6.3336e-15 s.

L= v * tau=2.976e8 *6.3336e-15.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15.

Multiply 2.976 *6.3336=?

2.976 *6=17.856.

2.976 *0.3336=approx 2.976 *0.3=0.8928, 2.976 *0.0336=0.1002. So total 0.8928 +0.1002=0.993.

So total 17.856 +0.993=18.849.

So 18.849e-7 m=1.8849e-6 m.

Still about 1.885 micrometers.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, the closest is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the 30% part. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum resolution in terms of the decay length being within the detection volume. So, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution must be such that the decay occurs within a distance L, leading to 30% of the particles decaying within L.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the probability of decaying within L is P=1 -e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L such that P=0.3, which is 30% of the particles have decayed by that distance. So, 30% have decayed, 70% are left.

So,

0.3 =1 -e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)} → e^{-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)}=0.7 → -L/(gamma beta c tau_0)=ln(0.7) → L= -gamma beta c tau_0 ln(0.7).

Wait, ln(0.7)= -0.35667.

So,

L= gamma beta c tau_0 *0.35667.

Wait, but that would give a shorter L than the mean path.

Hmm, because if L is such that 30% have decayed, then the mean decay length is gamma beta c tau_0, and 30% is a fraction of that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate L such that P=0.3, which is the point where 30% of the particles have decayed, and 70% are still alive.

So,

L = gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3))=gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/0.7) ≈ gamma beta c tau_0 *0.35667.

So,

L=0.35667 * gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, but gamma beta c tau_0 is the same as (gamma beta c) tau_0.

Wait, gamma beta c = (E/(m c²)) * beta c.

Wait, but E=gamma m c², so gamma beta c = (E/(m c²)) * (v) = (E/(m c²)) * (beta c) = (E beta c) / (m c²) )= E beta/(m c).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute L as:

L = gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Which is,

L=7.917 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *0.35667.

Compute step by step.

First, compute gamma beta: 7.917 *0.992=approx 7.86.

So,

7.86 *3e8=2.358e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.358e9 *8e-16 = (2.358 *8) *1e-7=18.864e-7 m=1.8864e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.35667: 1.8864e-6 *0.35667≈0.673e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

Which is about 0.673 micrometers.

But that's way below the options. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean path length multiplied by a factor involving the 30% efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean path length, and option A is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0 * (gamma factor) but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, reviewing all, perhaps the initial approach was correct. The minimum resolution needed is the mean decay length, which is L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

So,

gamma=7.915,

beta=0.992,

c=3e8 m/s,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L=7.915 *0.992 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute step by step.

7.915 *0.992 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8=2.358e9.

Multiply by8e-16: 2.358e9 *8e-16= (2.358 *8 ) *1e-7=18.864e-7=1.8864e-6 m.

Which is 1.8864 micrometers.

The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, where does 2.08 come from?

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×0.917=3.13 (since 3.41 ×0.9=3.069, 3.41×0.017=0.05797 → total 3.12697 ≈3.13).

So, gamma=7.917.

Then,

gamma * beta =7.917 *0.992≈7.86.

Now,

L=7.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.86 *3=23.58.

23.58e8 *8e-16=23.58 *8 *1e-8=188.64e-8=1.8864e-6 m.

Still 1.8864e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 27 GeV/c², not GeV. No, the problem states energy is 27 GeV, which is kinetic plus rest mass. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation uses the velocity as c, assuming beta is approximately 1. So, beta=c, but that would give a higher L.

So,

L=gamma *c *tau_0.

Gamma=7.915,

c=3e8,

tau_0=8e-16.

So,

L=7.915 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.915 *3=23.745.

23.745e8 *8e-16=23.745 *8 *1e-8=189.96e-8=1.8996e-6 m.

Still around 1.9e-6 m. Closer to 2e-6 m, which is option A (2.08e-6 m).

But why 2.08?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma and beta gives a slightly higher value.

Let me compute gamma with more precision.

gamma=27/3.41 =7.915 exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute beta more accurately.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41)^2/(27)^2).

Compute 3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01595035.

1 -0.01595035=0.98404965.

sqrt(0.98404965)=0.9920194.

So beta=0.9920194.

So,

L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.915,

beta=0.9920194,

c=3e8,

tau_0=8e-16.

Compute:

7.915 *0.9920194 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8=2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16=1.8864e-6 m.

Still the same.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Perhaps the question is not about the 30% of decays, but about the minimum resolution needed to observe the decay, which is the minimum distance the particle travels. So, the minimum would be when the decay occurs at the earliest possible time, but that's not physics since the decay is a Poisson process.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the minimum distance for 30% of the decays to have happened. So, the L computed as 1.88e-6 m would be the average, and to capture 30% of the decays, you need a longer L.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, the closest is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, 2.08e-6 is approximately 2.08 micrometers, which is about 10% higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using exact numbers.

Compute 27/3.41=7.915.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2))= sqrt(1 - (11.6281)/729)=sqrt(0.98404965)= approx 0.9920194.

So,

gamma * beta =7.915 *0.9920194=7.86.

L=7.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

Wait, 7.86 *3e8=2.358e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.358e9 *8e-16=1.8864e-6 m.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using c=3e8 m/s, but perhaps I should use more precise value, like 2.998e8 m/s.

Let me try that.

beta=0.9920194.

v=beta*c=0.9920194 *2.998e8 ≈2.975e8 m/s.

tau=gamma * tau_0=7.915 *8e-16=6.332e-15 s.

L= v * tau=2.975e8 *6.332e-15= (2.975 *6.332) *1e-7.

2.975 *6=17.85.

2.975 *0.332=0.987.

Total:17.85+0.987=18.837.

18.837e-7=1.8837e-6 m.

Still around 1.884 micrometers.

I think the correct calculation leads to L≈1.88e-6 m, but the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation without considering the 30% part, and just the mean path.

Wait, perhaps I completely misunderstood the question. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure. So, for a particle to decay, the detector must be able to see the decay point. So, the minimum resolution is the mean path length divided by some factor.

Wait, no, I think the question is asking for the minimum spatial resolution (like the smallest detail the detector can see) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the decay must be resolvable within that distance. So, perhaps the minimum is the mean path length multiplied by a factor based on the efficiency.

But I'm not exactly sure. Given the options, I think the intended answer is A) 2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the distance the particle travels before decaying. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The energy of the particle is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Velocity (\( v \)):**
   The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relation \( \beta = v/c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \):
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{(27)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{11.6281}{729}} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
   \]
   Thus, \( v = \beta c \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Dilated Lifetime (\( \tau \)):**
   The dilated lifetime is given by \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \tau = 7.915 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} = 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Path Length (\( L_{\text{mean}} \)):**
   The mean distance traveled by the particle before decaying is:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = v \tau = (2.976 \times 10^8) \times (6.332 \times 10^{-15}) \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.884 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]

5. **Distance for 30% Decays:**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the distance \( L \) must account for the exponential decay probability. The time \( t \) corresponding to 30% of the decays is determined using:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-t/\tau}, \quad P = 0.3 \implies t = -\tau \ln(0.7)
   \]
   Substituting \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.35667 \):
   \[
   t = \tau \times 0.35667
   \]
   The corresponding distance is:
   \[
   L = v t = v \tau \times 0.35667 = 1.884 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.35667 \approx 6.73 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \, (0.673 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]
   However, this result is inconsistent with the options provided, suggesting the question may instead refer to the mean path length or a related factor.

### Conclusion:
The closest option to the calculated mean decay path length (\( L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.884 \, \mu\text{m} \)) is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
