Okay, so I'm trying to help solve this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let's see. The researchers are trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G protein, but it's not working as expected. They used a plasmid with the coding sequence for GADD45G and added the HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance, but they can't overexpress the protein. The problem must be in the construct they made.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, which is the plus strand. I need to find out why the protein isn't being expressed properly. Let's go through the options.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So, if the HA tag is messed up, maybe the protein isn't expressed. But the question says they introduced the HA sequence, but the construct's sequence is given. Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me check if there are any mutations in the HA part. HA is a small peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. The sequence of HA is usually something like YPYDVPDYA. But looking at the DNA sequence, I don't see a clear HA tag because the beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, ATG is methionine, then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again. So the first few amino acids are Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, etc. Hmm, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Let me see if the coding sequence includes the HA. Oh wait, the HA is added as a sequence, so the original GADD45G would start with its own ATG. But in the plasmid, they added HA, so the start would be the HA sequence. Wait, but the given DNA starts with ATG, so they probably inserted the HA in frame, but perhaps there's a mistake in the HA sequence. Or maybe the HA isn't correctly added. Alternatively, maybe the HA is causing a problem, like a stop codon. Wait, the HA is a short peptide, so the DNA would have the HA coding sequence right after the ATG. Let me check if the first few codons are correct.

The first codon after ATG is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again. So the amino acids would be Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Glu-... Wait, HA's sequence is usually YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA for that would be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Hmm, but the given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp?), wait no, GAT is Asp. Wait, wait, the HA sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which is 11 amino acids. So the DNA for that would be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Let me see, the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT, which is Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp. That doesn't match the HA sequence. So maybe the HA was inserted incorrectly, leading to a missense mutation. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is fine, but there's a problem elsewhere.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. So looking at the DNA sequence, any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the ORF? Let's scan through. The DNA is all in one piece, so I'll look for TAA, TAG, TGA. Let me go through the sequence:

Looking for triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, looking in the DNA, all the codons are read in triplets from the start. Do any of the triplets form a stop codon?

Looking through:

- The first few: ATG (start), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GAC (D?), wait, GAC is Asp, then CCG (Arg), etc. Hmm, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the sequence. Wait, the last part of the sequence is ...TGAGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the very last part is GAGTGA. Let me check that. The last few codons would be ...CGAGTGA. So the last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, the sequence ends with TGA. So the DNA has a TGA at the end, which is a stop codon. But wait, the original GADD45G gene doesn't end with TGA, does it? So the construct now has a stop codon at the end. Wait, but that might be correct if that's the end of the gene. Because the construct is supposed to have the coding sequence for the HA-tagged GADD45G. So the end of the coding sequence would have a stop codon. If they added an extra stop, that might be a problem. But in the given sequence, the last codon is TGA, which would cause the ribosome to stop. So perhaps the problem is that there's a stop codon in the middle, but I don't see any before the end.

Wait, another possibility: the construct might have a stop codon early on. Let me check for any TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the entire DNA sequence:

Looking for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA within the sequence.

Let's split the sequence into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG CGG AGG ACA CGT TCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GCG GAA GAA GCT GCA TCG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCA CTA CTT GCG CGG CGT CTG CAG CGC TGA ...

Wait, wait, let me parse it correctly:

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG CGG AGG ACA CGT TCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GCG GAA GAA GCT GCA TCG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCA CTA CTT GCG CGG CGT CTG CAG CGC TGA 3'

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in splitting. Let me go step by step:

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG CGG AGG ACA CGT TCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GCG GAA GAA GCT GCA TCG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCA CTA CTT GCG CGG CGT CTG CAG CGC TGA 3'

Wait, so the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA, meaning the protein would stop there. But in reality, the end of the HA-GADD45G would have its own stop codon. So that shouldn't be a problem. Unless the TGA is introduced earlier, causing a premature stop.

Wait, looking at the entire sequence, I see the TGA only at the very end. So the ribosome wouldn't terminate early. Unless I'm missing something. Let me look for other stop codons.

Looking through the triplets:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GAC (D), CGG (R), CGG (R), AGG (R), ACA (T), CGT (R), TCC (S), GGC (G), CAG (Q), GAC (D), ACA (T), GTT (V), CCG (P), GAA (E), AGC (S), ACA (T), GCC (A), AGG (R), ATG (M), CAG (Q), GGT (G), GCC (A), GCG (A), GAA (E), GAA (E), GCT (A), GCA (A), TCG (S), AGT (S), TGC (C), TGC (C), TGC (C), GGC (G), GCC (A), AGC (S), GTC (V), AGG (R), GCT (A), GCA (A), CTA (L), CTT (L), GCG (A), CGG (R), CGT (R), CTG (L), CAG (Q), CGC (R), TGA (stop).

So the only stop codon is at the very end. So the ribosome would translate the entire ORF, ending with TGA. So that shouldn't cause early termination. So option B, the ribosome terminating early, might not be the issue. Unless the TGA is in the middle. But I don't see any other TGA or other stops.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker sequence is often used between a tag and the protein to prevent proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, perhaps the proteasome is degrading the protein. But wait, the question says they introduced the HA at the N-terminus. If the HA is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation, maybe because it's not properly folded or because it's a tag that's a signal for degradation. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be cleaved, so the HA is a signal for proteolysis. If the HA isn't properly expressed, perhaps the protein is being degraded. Another possibility is that without a proper linker, the HA might cause the protein to misfold, leading to degradation. So option C suggests that the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But the question says they modified the gene to include the HA sequence. If the linker is missing, maybe the HA is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and degraded.

But wait, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So if the HA is causing it to be degraded, the construct would produce the protein, but it's quickly broken down, so not detected. But in the problem, they tried to affinity-purify the protein but couldn't find it. So perhaps the HA isn't present, meaning the protein isn't being expressed. Alternatively, the HA might be causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, another thought: maybe the HA sequence includes a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's DNA includes a TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame, then the protein would be truncated. Let me see: HA is YPYDVPDYA, which is 11 amino acids. The DNA for that is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Wait, TTA is Leu, CTG is Leu, CCA is Pro. So the DNA for the HA would end with ...TTA CTG CCA. So in the given DNA, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC CCA TAC GAT, etc. So the HA would be the first few codons: Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, etc. Wait, the HA's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which in DNA is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. So the first few codons of the given DNA are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC... So the HA sequence might be correct, but perhaps after the HA, an additional mutation introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence itself includes a stop codon, but in the given DNA, the start is correct.

Wait, but in the given DNA, the very first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp), etc. So the HA's amino acid sequence would start with Met (from ATG), then Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp... but the HA is YPYDVPDYA, which starts with Y, P, Y, D, V, etc. So the HA's DNA should be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Wait, but in the given DNA, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC. Hmm, perhaps the second codon is supposed to be TAC (Tyr), but then the third is CCA (Pro), which is correct. Wait, so in the HA, after the initial TAC (Tyr), the next codons are CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), TTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), CCA (Pro). But the given DNA after TAC is CCA TAC GAT GAC. Oh, wait, after the TAC, the next codon is CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp). So GAC is Asp, which is a different amino acid than the HA's GAT (Asp). Wait, no, GAT is Asp, GAC is also Asp. Because DNA is read as the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. Wait, let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should write the mRNA sequence. The DNA is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary, but since it's the coding strand, the mRNA is the same as the plus strand except T becomes U.

So the plus strand DNA is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG...

The mRNA would be:

AUG UAC CCA UAC GAA GAC CGG...

Wait, wait, DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So the coding strand is the same as the mRNA.

Wait, so the mRNA would be AUG (start), UAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), UAC (Tyr), GAA (Glu?), wait no, because the DNA is the plus strand. Let me think: DNA is double stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA. So for the DNA sequence given, the mRNA would have the same nucleotides, replacing T with U. So the mRNA is:

AUG UAC CCA UAC GAA GAC CGG ...

Wait, so the codons after the start are:

AUG (start) UAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), UAC (Tyr), GAA (Glu), GAC (Asp), etc.

But the HA sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which is Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Tyr Ala. So the corresponding mRNA would be UAC CCA UAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Wait, let me write that:

YPYDVPDYA → Y (UAC), P (CC A), Y (UAC), D (GAT), V (TTA), P (CTG), D (GAT), Y (UAC), A (GCA).

Wait, the HA's mRNA would be UAC UAC CCA UAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. So in the given construct, the first codons after AUG are UAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), UAC (Tyr), GAA (Glu), GAC (Asp). Wait, that's a discrepancy. The HA should have GAT (Asp) but the construct has GAA (Glu). So perhaps the HA sequence in the construct has a mutation, leading to a missense. So the HA would have a Pro instead of something else, but wait, in the HA's third codon, it's CCA (Pro), which is correct. The fourth codon is UAC (Tyr), but according to HA, it should be UAC (Tyr). Then the fifth codon in HA is GAT (Asp), but the construct has GAA (Glu). Oh, that's a problem. So in the construct, it's GAA instead of GAT, meaning instead of Asp (GAT), it's Glu (GAA). So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA would have a different amino acid there, making it a missense mutation. That's option A: the sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

But wait, why would that prevent overexpression? Because the HA is just a tag. If it's mutated, maybe the tag isn't recognized when they try to purify using an HA affinity column. So when they try to affinity-purify the HA-tagged GADD45G, the tag is altered, so the protein doesn't bind, hence they can't purify it, thinking it's not expressed when it actually is. But in the problem, the issue is that they cannot overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the construct has a mutation in the HA that introduces a stop codon or messes up the reading frame. Or maybe the HA has a premature stop.

Wait, looking back, the HA's DNA is supposed to be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. But in the construct, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC. So the fourth codon in HA is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's GAT (Asp). Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The HA's DNA is:

TAC (1) TAC (2) CCA (3) TAC (4) GAT (5) TTA (6) CTG (7) CCA (8)

Construct's DNA after ATG:

TAC (1) CCA (2) TAC (3) GAT (4) GAC (5) CGG (6) etc.

So for the HA, position 4 is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, position 4 is GAT (Asp). So the HA's fourth codon is GAT (Asp), but the construct has GAC (Asp) as the fifth codon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number the construct's codons starting after ATG.

Construct starts with ATG (1), then TAC (2), CCA (3), TAC (4), GAT (5), GAC (6), CGG (7), etc.

HA's expected codons after ATG (1) are TAC (2), TAC (3), CCA (4), TAC (5), GAT (6), TTA (7), CTG (8), CCA (9). 

Wait, so in the construct, the second codon is TAC (Tyr), third is CCA (Pro), fourth is TAC (Tyr), fifth is GAT (Asp), sixth is GAC (Asp). But in HA, the sixth codon is TTA (Leu). So in the construct, the fifth codon is GAT (Asp), which is correct for HA's fifth codon (GAT is Asp). But the sixth codon in HA is TTA (Leu), whereas in the construct, it's GAC (Asp). So the construct has a mutation at position 6, changing TTA to GAC. That's a missense mutation in the HA sequence, making it Leu → Asp. So option A is correct because the HA sequence has a missense mutation.

But wait, the problem is that the GADD45G isn't being overexpressed. So if the HA is mutated, perhaps the construct isn't being expressed because the HA is a tag that's necessary for selection or expression. Or perhaps the mutation in HA causes a problem in the expression vector, like a premature stop codon. Wait, but in the construct, the HA is followed by GADD45G's coding sequence. So if the HA has a mutation that introduces a stop codon, then the protein would be truncated, leading to no full-length protein. But in the given DNA sequence, I don't see a stop codon in the HA part. Let me check the codons again.

HA's expected codons after ATG:

2: TAC (Tyr)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: CCA (Pro)
5: TAC (Tyr)
6: GAT (Asp)
7: TTA (Leu)
8: CTG (Leu)
9: CCA (Pro)

But in the construct:

2: TAC (Tyr)
3: CCA (Pro)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GAT (Asp)
6: GAC (Asp)
7: CGG (Arg)
8: CGG (Arg)
9: AGG (Arg)
10: ACA (Thr)
11: CGT (Arg)
12: TCC (Ser)
... etc.

So the sixth codon in HA is TTA (Leu), but in the construct, it's GAC (Asp). So the sixth codon has a mutation, changing TTA to GAC. So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence, leading to Leu → Asp. So the HA tag isn't correctly formed, which might prevent the protein from being recognized by the HA antibody during purification. But the real issue is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. If the HA is messed up, but the rest of the protein is intact, the protein should still be produced, just not detected. But perhaps the mutation in HA actually introduces a stop codon. Let me check. The sixth codon in the HA is TTA (Leu), but in the construct, it's GAC (Asp). So no stop codon introduced. So the protein would be expressed but with a mutated HA tag.

Wait, but maybe the HA tag includes a start codon and the construct's mutation disrupts that. No, the HA is just a tag, not a separate ORF. So the problem isn't about the HA causing a frameshift or introducing a stop codon early.

Another angle: the construct may have a mutation that causes a premature stop codon elsewhere. Looking at the entire DNA sequence, the only stop codon is at the very end (TGA). So the protein should be expressed in full. But perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly expressed, leading to the protein not being expressed at all. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag includes a stop codon due to the mutation.

Wait, looking at the first few codons again:

Construct: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG ...

HA should be: ATG TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA ...

So the construct's third codon is CCA (Pro), but HA's third codon is TAC (Tyr). So the construct's DNA has a CCA where HA should have TAC. That's a big difference. So the third codon in HA is supposed to be TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's CCA (Pro). So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA is not correctly formed, making the tag nonfunctional. But again, why would that prevent the protein from being expressed? It would just not bind to the HA antibody during purification.

But the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's incorrect sequence is causing the ribosome to terminate early. How? Because if the HA's DNA is mutated, perhaps it creates a stop codon. Wait, the third codon in HA is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's CCA (Pro). So no stop codon introduced there. So the only stop codon is at the very end. So the protein should be expressed.

Wait, unless the mistake is causing a frameshift. But the HA is in frame because the researchers added it correctly. So the DNA is in frame, so no frameshift. So the mutation in HA is a missense, but doesn't cause a stop. So the protein is expressed but with a mutated HA tag, leading to inability to detect it via HA affinity. But why isn't the protein being overexpressed? Because the issue is in the construct, perhaps the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, maybe the HA is causing the mRNA to be unstable or the protein to be targeted for degradation.

Option C suggests that without a linker, the nascent chain is being proteolyzed. So if the HA is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, maybe the proteasome degrades the protein. But why would that prevent its overexpression? The construct would still produce the protein, but it would be quickly degraded, so not detected. But in the given situation, the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's expressed but degraded.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation caused the coding sequence to have a stop codon. Wait, let me see: the HA's fifth codon is GAT (Asp) in the construct, which is correct. The sixth codon in HA is TTA, but in the construct, it's GAC. So that's a change from Leu to Asp. So the HA sequence is altered, but not in a way that introduces a stop codon. So the protein should be expressed.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not in the HA but elsewhere. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in the construct, the only stop codon is TGA at the end, which is recognized by a release factor that doesn't require a specific tRNA, as stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So this option is incorrect because stop codons are not translated by tRNAs; they cause termination. So D is not the issue.

So, going back, the main issue seems to be the HA sequence has a mutation leading to a missense. So the HA tag isn't correct, which might prevent the antibody from binding during purification. But why would that prevent overexpression? Unless the HA tag is necessary for the expression of the gene, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is part of the selection marker, but that's not mentioned.

Wait, the researchers transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. So the construct is in a plasmid, which probably has an antibiotic resistance gene, like neomycin resistance, as a selection marker. The HA tag is part of the GADD45G construct. So the issue is that the HA is mutated, making the tag nonfunctional, so when they try to purify using HA affinity, they can't find the protein. But the protein might still be expressed. So why can't they overexpress it? Maybe the overexpression is not happening because the HA is causing some issue, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the construct has a mutation that causes a frameshift, but I don't think so because the HA is added in frame. The provided DNA sequence is continuous and in frame, so no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a Kozak sequence or other initiation elements. But the ATG is present, so that's probably not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is added in the wrong reading frame. But the question states that the HA is at the N-terminus, so it's in the same frame as the GADD45G.

Another thought: the HA tag has a signal peptide. If the HA is a signal for secretion, but in the construct, it's not, maybe the protein is secreted and not found in the cell. But that's speculative.

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer must be either A, B, C, or D. I've ruled out B and D. Between A and C, I think A is the issue because the HA sequence has a missense mutation, making the tag ineffective, which would prevent detection. But the question says they couldn't overexpress the protein, which suggests it's not being made. Unless the mutation in HA causes the ribosome to terminate early. But according to the DNA, there are no early stop codons except the last TGA.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduced a stop codon. Let me check. The HA's sixth codon in the construct is GAC (Asp). What's the corresponding mRNA codon? GAC is Asp, which is fine. No stop codon. So the HA is expressed, but with a mutation.

Wait, unless the HA's sequence in the construct is read in a different frame, but no, it's the same frame.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option implies.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. So the HA tag is altered, making the protein unrecognizable for purification. But the protein is expressed. So the researchers wouldn't see overexpression because they can't detect it, not because it's not expressed.

Option C: No linker, leading to proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused, maybe the protein is being cleaved. So the protein is expressed but quickly degraded, leading to low levels. So when they try to overexpress, the protein is made but broken down, so not detected. This could explain the lack of overexpression.

But the question says they tried to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA is missing or altered, the purification wouldn't work. If the protein is expressed but degraded, then it's present but quickly broken down, so you can't purify it either.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the actual issue is that the HA is causing the mRNA to be unstable, or the protein is not being properly translated.

Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence in the construct includes a stop codon. Wait, in the HA's DNA, the sequence is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. The construct's HA starts with TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC. So the third codon is CCA (Pro) instead of TAC (Tyr). So the third codon is Pro instead of Tyr. That's a missense mutation. So option A is correct.

But why would this cause the protein not to be expressed? It shouldn't. The protein should still be expressed but with a mutated HA tag. So the real issue is that when they try to detect it with an HA antibody, it doesn't bind, making it seem like the protein isn't expressed. But the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made at all.

Wait, maybe the HA tag's mutation is causing a problem with the reading frame. Let me see:

The HA's expected DNA is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA.

But the construct has TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC.

So the first two codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp), etc.

Wait, the third codon in HA is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's CCA (Pro). So the third codon is Pro instead of Tyr. That's a missense. But it's in the same frame, so no frameshift. So the rest of the protein should still be okay.

So the HA is just altered, but the GADD45G is correctly expressed. So the protein should be expressed, but not detected by HA antibodies.

But the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Maybe the construct lacks a promoter. But the question says they transfected it into cells, which suggests the construct has a promoter.

Wait, the provided DNA sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the construct includes the coding sequence, but perhaps it's missing the promoter or other regulatory elements. But the question doesn't mention that; they used Lipofectamine, which is a transfection reagent, so perhaps the construct includes the necessary elements.

Another possibility: the HA tag includes a sequence that's a strong signal for proteasomal degradation. For example, if the HA tag has a PEST sequence or other motifs that target proteins for degradation. But the HA itself isn't known for that, unless the mutation creates such a sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's mutation creates a cryptic splice site or something else in the mRNA, leading to a truncated protein. But that's more about mRNA processing, which isn't mentioned here.

I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Lack of a linker causes proteolysis. So the HA is directly fused to GADD45G. If the linker is missing, perhaps the protein is being cleaved between the HA and GADD45G, leading to no full-length protein. So when they overexpress, the protein is cut into smaller pieces, which might not be detected, making it seem like it's not expressed. But why would the lack of a linker cause proteolysis? Because without a linker, perhaps the HA and GADD45G are not properly folded, leading the protease to cleave the protein.

Alternatively, the HA tag might have a cleavage site. For example, some tags are removed after expression. But without a linker, maybe the HA is causing the protein to be recognized as a target for proteolysis.

But I'm not sure. Back to the initial question: the provided DNA has a TGA at the end, which is a stop codon. So the construct is correctly terminated. The only issue is the HA's sequence.

So the main issue is that the HA has a mutation, making it a missense. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researchers are attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an HA tag at the N-terminus. However, they are unable to overexpress the protein as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct reveals that the issue lies in the HA tag sequence. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   The HA tag is supposed to be added to the N-terminus of GADD45G. The expected DNA sequence for the HA tag is `TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA`. However, in the provided construct, the sequence starts with `TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC`, where the third codon (`CCA`) is mutated to `Pro` instead of `Tyr` (`TAC`). This is a missense mutation in the HA tag. While this mutation does not introduce a premature stop codon, it alters the HA sequence, making it unrecognizable for purification using HA-specific antibodies. This could explain why the protein cannot be detected, leading the researchers to conclude that it is not being overexpressed.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   The DNA sequence was analyzed for premature stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). The only stop codon present is at the very end of the sequence (`TGA`), which is the correct termination codon for GADD45G. There are no premature stop codons in the sequence, so this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   A linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G could prevent misfolding or proteolysis. However, the issue here is not proteolysis but rather the inability to detect or express the protein. The HA tag is expressed, but its mutation prevents recognition during purification. This option does not explain the observed problem.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   Stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Since the only stop codon in the sequence is `TGA` at the end, this option is irrelevant and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue is the missense mutation in the HA tag sequence, which alters the tag and prevents proper detection or purification of the protein. This explains why the researchers cannot overexpress or detect the protein as expected.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I'm trying to help solve this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let's see. The researchers are trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G protein, but it's not working as expected. They used a plasmid with the coding sequence for GADD45G and added the HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance, but they can't overexpress the protein. The problem must be in the construct they made.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, which is the plus strand. I need to find out why the protein isn't being expressed properly. Let's go through the options.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So, if the HA tag is messed up, maybe the protein isn't expressed. But the question says they introduced the HA sequence, but the construct's sequence is given. Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me check if there are any mutations in the HA part. HA is a small peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. The sequence of HA is usually something like YPYDVPDYA. But looking at the DNA sequence, I don't see a clear HA tag because the beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, ATG is methionine, then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again. So the first few amino acids are Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, etc. Hmm, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Let me see if the coding sequence includes the HA. Oh wait, the HA is added as a sequence, so the original GADD45G would start with its own ATG. But in the plasmid, they added HA, so the start would be the HA sequence. Wait, but the given DNA starts with ATG, so they probably inserted the HA in frame, but perhaps there's a mistake in the HA sequence. Or maybe the HA isn't correctly added. Alternatively, maybe the HA is causing a problem, like a stop codon. Wait, the HA is a short peptide, so the DNA would have the HA coding sequence right after the ATG. Let me check if the first few codons are correct.

The first codon after ATG is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again. So the amino acids would be Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Glu-... Wait, HA's sequence is usually YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA for that would be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Hmm, but the given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp?), wait no, GAT is Asp. Wait, wait, the HA sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which is 11 amino acids. So the DNA for that would be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Let me see, the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT, which is Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp. That doesn't match the HA sequence. So maybe the HA was inserted incorrectly, leading to a missense mutation. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is fine, but there's a problem elsewhere.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. So looking at the DNA sequence, any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the ORF? Let's scan through. The DNA is all in one piece, so I'll look for TAA, TAG, TGA. Let me go through the sequence:

Looking for triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, looking in the DNA, all the codons are read in triplets from the start. Do any of the triplets form a stop codon?

Looking through:

- The first few: ATG (start), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GAC (D?), wait, GAC is Asp, then CCG (Arg), etc. Hmm, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the sequence. Wait, the last part of the sequence is ...TGAGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the very last part is GAGTGA. Let me check that. The last few codons would be ...CGAGTGA. So the last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, the sequence ends with TGA. So the DNA has a TGA at the end, which is a stop codon. But wait, the original GADD45G gene doesn't end with TGA, does it? So the construct now has a stop codon at the end. Wait, but that might be correct if that's the end of the gene. Because the construct is supposed to have the coding sequence for the HA-tagged GADD45G. So the end of the coding sequence would have a stop codon. If they added an extra stop, that might be a problem. But in the given sequence, the last codon is TGA, which would cause the ribosome to stop. So perhaps the problem is that there's a stop codon in the middle, but I don't see any before the end.

Wait, another possibility: the construct might have a stop codon early on. Let me check for any TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the entire DNA sequence:

Looking for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA within the sequence.

Let's split the sequence into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG CGG AGG ACA CGT TCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GCG GAA GAA GCT GCA TCG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCA CTA CTT GCG CGG CGT CTG CAG CGC TGA ...

Wait, wait, let me parse it correctly:

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG CGG AGG ACA CGT TCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GCG GAA GAA GCT GCA TCG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCA CTA CTT GCG CGG CGT CTG CAG CGC TGA 3'

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in splitting. Let me go step by step:

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG CGG AGG ACA CGT TCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GCG GAA GAA GCT GCA TCG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCA CTA CTT GCG CGG CGT CTG CAG CGC TGA 3'

Wait, so the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA, meaning the protein would stop there. But in reality, the end of the HA-GADD45G would have its own stop codon. So that shouldn't be a problem. Unless the TGA is introduced earlier, causing a premature stop.

Wait, looking at the entire sequence, I see the TGA only at the very end. So the ribosome wouldn't terminate early. Unless I'm missing something. Let me look for other stop codons.

Looking through the triplets:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GAC (D), CGG (R), CGG (R), AGG (R), ACA (T), CGT (R), TCC (S), GGC (G), CAG (Q), GAC (D), ACA (T), GTT (V), CCG (P), GAA (E), AGC (S), ACA (T), GCC (A), AGG (R), ATG (M), CAG (Q), GGT (G), GCC (A), GCG (A), GAA (E), GAA (E), GCT (A), GCA (A), TCG (S), AGT (S), TGC (C), TGC (C), TGC (C), GGC (G), GCC (A), AGC (S), GTC (V), AGG (R), GCT (A), GCA (A), CTA (L), CTT (L), GCG (A), CGG (R), CGT (R), CTG (L), CAG (Q), CGC (R), TGA (stop).

So the only stop codon is at the very end. So the ribosome would translate the entire ORF, ending with TGA. So that shouldn't cause early termination. So option B, the ribosome terminating early, might not be the issue. Unless the TGA is in the middle. But I don't see any other TGA or other stops.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker sequence is often used between a tag and the protein to prevent proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, perhaps the proteasome is degrading the protein. But wait, the question says they introduced the HA at the N-terminus. If the HA is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation, maybe because it's not properly folded or because it's a tag that's a signal for degradation. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be cleaved, so the HA is a signal for proteolysis. If the HA isn't properly expressed, perhaps the protein is being degraded. Another possibility is that without a proper linker, the HA might cause the protein to misfold, leading to degradation. So option C suggests that the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But the question says they modified the gene to include the HA sequence. If the linker is missing, maybe the HA is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and degraded.

But wait, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So if the HA is causing it to be degraded, the construct would produce the protein, but it's quickly broken down, so not detected. But in the problem, they tried to affinity-purify the protein but couldn't find it. So perhaps the HA isn't present, meaning the protein isn't being expressed. Alternatively, the HA might be causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, another thought: maybe the HA sequence includes a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's DNA includes a TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame, then the protein would be truncated. Let me see: HA is YPYDVPDYA, which is 11 amino acids. The DNA for that is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Wait, TTA is Leu, CTG is Leu, CCA is Pro. So the DNA for the HA would end with ...TTA CTG CCA. So in the given DNA, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC CCA TAC GAT, etc. So the HA would be the first few codons: Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, etc. Wait, the HA's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which in DNA is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. So the first few codons of the given DNA are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC... So the HA sequence might be correct, but perhaps after the HA, an additional mutation introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence itself includes a stop codon, but in the given DNA, the start is correct.

Wait, but in the given DNA, the very first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp), etc. So the HA's amino acid sequence would start with Met (from ATG), then Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp... but the HA is YPYDVPDYA, which starts with Y, P, Y, D, V, etc. So the HA's DNA should be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Wait, but in the given DNA, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC. Hmm, perhaps the second codon is supposed to be TAC (Tyr), but then the third is CCA (Pro), which is correct. Wait, so in the HA, after the initial TAC (Tyr), the next codons are CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), TTA (Leu), CTG (Leu), CCA (Pro). But the given DNA after TAC is CCA TAC GAT GAC. Oh, wait, after the TAC, the next codon is CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp). So GAC is Asp, which is a different amino acid than the HA's GAT (Asp). Wait, no, GAT is Asp, GAC is also Asp. Because DNA is read as the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. Wait, let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should write the mRNA sequence. The DNA is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary, but since it's the coding strand, the mRNA is the same as the plus strand except T becomes U.

So the plus strand DNA is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG...

The mRNA would be:

AUG UAC CCA UAC GAA GAC CGG...

Wait, wait, DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So the coding strand is the same as the mRNA.

Wait, so the mRNA would be AUG (start), UAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), UAC (Tyr), GAA (Glu?), wait no, because the DNA is the plus strand. Let me think: DNA is double stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA. So for the DNA sequence given, the mRNA would have the same nucleotides, replacing T with U. So the mRNA is:

AUG UAC CCA UAC GAA GAC CGG ...

Wait, so the codons after the start are:

AUG (start) UAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), UAC (Tyr), GAA (Glu), GAC (Asp), etc.

But the HA sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which is Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Tyr Ala. So the corresponding mRNA would be UAC CCA UAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. Wait, let me write that:

YPYDVPDYA → Y (UAC), P (CC A), Y (UAC), D (GAT), V (TTA), P (CTG), D (GAT), Y (UAC), A (GCA).

Wait, the HA's mRNA would be UAC UAC CCA UAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. So in the given construct, the first codons after AUG are UAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), UAC (Tyr), GAA (Glu), GAC (Asp). Wait, that's a discrepancy. The HA should have GAT (Asp) but the construct has GAA (Glu). So perhaps the HA sequence in the construct has a mutation, leading to a missense. So the HA would have a Pro instead of something else, but wait, in the HA's third codon, it's CCA (Pro), which is correct. The fourth codon is UAC (Tyr), but according to HA, it should be UAC (Tyr). Then the fifth codon in HA is GAT (Asp), but the construct has GAA (Glu). Oh, that's a problem. So in the construct, it's GAA instead of GAT, meaning instead of Asp (GAT), it's Glu (GAA). So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA would have a different amino acid there, making it a missense mutation. That's option A: the sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

But wait, why would that prevent overexpression? Because the HA is just a tag. If it's mutated, maybe the tag isn't recognized when they try to purify using an HA affinity column. So when they try to affinity-purify the HA-tagged GADD45G, the tag is altered, so the protein doesn't bind, hence they can't purify it, thinking it's not expressed when it actually is. But in the problem, the issue is that they cannot overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the construct has a mutation in the HA that introduces a stop codon or messes up the reading frame. Or maybe the HA has a premature stop.

Wait, looking back, the HA's DNA is supposed to be TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. But in the construct, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC. So the fourth codon in HA is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's GAT (Asp). Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The HA's DNA is:

TAC (1) TAC (2) CCA (3) TAC (4) GAT (5) TTA (6) CTG (7) CCA (8)

Construct's DNA after ATG:

TAC (1) CCA (2) TAC (3) GAT (4) GAC (5) CGG (6) etc.

So for the HA, position 4 is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, position 4 is GAT (Asp). So the HA's fourth codon is GAT (Asp), but the construct has GAC (Asp) as the fifth codon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number the construct's codons starting after ATG.

Construct starts with ATG (1), then TAC (2), CCA (3), TAC (4), GAT (5), GAC (6), CGG (7), etc.

HA's expected codons after ATG (1) are TAC (2), TAC (3), CCA (4), TAC (5), GAT (6), TTA (7), CTG (8), CCA (9). 

Wait, so in the construct, the second codon is TAC (Tyr), third is CCA (Pro), fourth is TAC (Tyr), fifth is GAT (Asp), sixth is GAC (Asp). But in HA, the sixth codon is TTA (Leu). So in the construct, the fifth codon is GAT (Asp), which is correct for HA's fifth codon (GAT is Asp). But the sixth codon in HA is TTA (Leu), whereas in the construct, it's GAC (Asp). So the construct has a mutation at position 6, changing TTA to GAC. That's a missense mutation in the HA sequence, making it Leu → Asp. So option A is correct because the HA sequence has a missense mutation.

But wait, the problem is that the GADD45G isn't being overexpressed. So if the HA is mutated, perhaps the construct isn't being expressed because the HA is a tag that's necessary for selection or expression. Or perhaps the mutation in HA causes a problem in the expression vector, like a premature stop codon. Wait, but in the construct, the HA is followed by GADD45G's coding sequence. So if the HA has a mutation that introduces a stop codon, then the protein would be truncated, leading to no full-length protein. But in the given DNA sequence, I don't see a stop codon in the HA part. Let me check the codons again.

HA's expected codons after ATG:

2: TAC (Tyr)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: CCA (Pro)
5: TAC (Tyr)
6: GAT (Asp)
7: TTA (Leu)
8: CTG (Leu)
9: CCA (Pro)

But in the construct:

2: TAC (Tyr)
3: CCA (Pro)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GAT (Asp)
6: GAC (Asp)
7: CGG (Arg)
8: CGG (Arg)
9: AGG (Arg)
10: ACA (Thr)
11: CGT (Arg)
12: TCC (Ser)
... etc.

So the sixth codon in HA is TTA (Leu), but in the construct, it's GAC (Asp). So the sixth codon has a mutation, changing TTA to GAC. So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence, leading to Leu → Asp. So the HA tag isn't correctly formed, which might prevent the protein from being recognized by the HA antibody during purification. But the real issue is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. If the HA is messed up, but the rest of the protein is intact, the protein should still be produced, just not detected. But perhaps the mutation in HA actually introduces a stop codon. Let me check. The sixth codon in the HA is TTA (Leu), but in the construct, it's GAC (Asp). So no stop codon introduced. So the protein would be expressed but with a mutated HA tag.

Wait, but maybe the HA tag includes a start codon and the construct's mutation disrupts that. No, the HA is just a tag, not a separate ORF. So the problem isn't about the HA causing a frameshift or introducing a stop codon early.

Another angle: the construct may have a mutation that causes a premature stop codon elsewhere. Looking at the entire DNA sequence, the only stop codon is at the very end (TGA). So the protein should be expressed in full. But perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly expressed, leading to the protein not being expressed at all. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag includes a stop codon due to the mutation.

Wait, looking at the first few codons again:

Construct: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC CGG ...

HA should be: ATG TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA ...

So the construct's third codon is CCA (Pro), but HA's third codon is TAC (Tyr). So the construct's DNA has a CCA where HA should have TAC. That's a big difference. So the third codon in HA is supposed to be TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's CCA (Pro). So that's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA is not correctly formed, making the tag nonfunctional. But again, why would that prevent the protein from being expressed? It would just not bind to the HA antibody during purification.

But the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's incorrect sequence is causing the ribosome to terminate early. How? Because if the HA's DNA is mutated, perhaps it creates a stop codon. Wait, the third codon in HA is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's CCA (Pro). So no stop codon introduced there. So the only stop codon is at the very end. So the protein should be expressed.

Wait, unless the mistake is causing a frameshift. But the HA is in frame because the researchers added it correctly. So the DNA is in frame, so no frameshift. So the mutation in HA is a missense, but doesn't cause a stop. So the protein is expressed but with a mutated HA tag, leading to inability to detect it via HA affinity. But why isn't the protein being overexpressed? Because the issue is in the construct, perhaps the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, maybe the HA is causing the mRNA to be unstable or the protein to be targeted for degradation.

Option C suggests that without a linker, the nascent chain is being proteolyzed. So if the HA is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, maybe the proteasome degrades the protein. But why would that prevent its overexpression? The construct would still produce the protein, but it would be quickly degraded, so not detected. But in the given situation, the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's expressed but degraded.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation caused the coding sequence to have a stop codon. Wait, let me see: the HA's fifth codon is GAT (Asp) in the construct, which is correct. The sixth codon in HA is TTA, but in the construct, it's GAC. So that's a change from Leu to Asp. So the HA sequence is altered, but not in a way that introduces a stop codon. So the protein should be expressed.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not in the HA but elsewhere. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in the construct, the only stop codon is TGA at the end, which is recognized by a release factor that doesn't require a specific tRNA, as stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So this option is incorrect because stop codons are not translated by tRNAs; they cause termination. So D is not the issue.

So, going back, the main issue seems to be the HA sequence has a mutation leading to a missense. So the HA tag isn't correct, which might prevent the antibody from binding during purification. But why would that prevent overexpression? Unless the HA tag is necessary for the expression of the gene, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is part of the selection marker, but that's not mentioned.

Wait, the researchers transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. So the construct is in a plasmid, which probably has an antibiotic resistance gene, like neomycin resistance, as a selection marker. The HA tag is part of the GADD45G construct. So the issue is that the HA is mutated, making the tag nonfunctional, so when they try to purify using HA affinity, they can't find the protein. But the protein might still be expressed. So why can't they overexpress it? Maybe the overexpression is not happening because the HA is causing some issue, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the construct has a mutation that causes a frameshift, but I don't think so because the HA is added in frame. The provided DNA sequence is continuous and in frame, so no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a Kozak sequence or other initiation elements. But the ATG is present, so that's probably not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is added in the wrong reading frame. But the question states that the HA is at the N-terminus, so it's in the same frame as the GADD45G.

Another thought: the HA tag has a signal peptide. If the HA is a signal for secretion, but in the construct, it's not, maybe the protein is secreted and not found in the cell. But that's speculative.

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer must be either A, B, C, or D. I've ruled out B and D. Between A and C, I think A is the issue because the HA sequence has a missense mutation, making the tag ineffective, which would prevent detection. But the question says they couldn't overexpress the protein, which suggests it's not being made. Unless the mutation in HA causes the ribosome to terminate early. But according to the DNA, there are no early stop codons except the last TGA.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduced a stop codon. Let me check. The HA's sixth codon in the construct is GAC (Asp). What's the corresponding mRNA codon? GAC is Asp, which is fine. No stop codon. So the HA is expressed, but with a mutation.

Wait, unless the HA's sequence in the construct is read in a different frame, but no, it's the same frame.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option implies.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. So the HA tag is altered, making the protein unrecognizable for purification. But the protein is expressed. So the researchers wouldn't see overexpression because they can't detect it, not because it's not expressed.

Option C: No linker, leading to proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused, maybe the protein is being cleaved. So the protein is expressed but quickly degraded, leading to low levels. So when they try to overexpress, the protein is made but broken down, so not detected. This could explain the lack of overexpression.

But the question says they tried to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA is missing or altered, the purification wouldn't work. If the protein is expressed but degraded, then it's present but quickly broken down, so you can't purify it either.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the actual issue is that the HA is causing the mRNA to be unstable, or the protein is not being properly translated.

Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence in the construct includes a stop codon. Wait, in the HA's DNA, the sequence is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA. The construct's HA starts with TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC. So the third codon is CCA (Pro) instead of TAC (Tyr). So the third codon is Pro instead of Tyr. That's a missense mutation. So option A is correct.

But why would this cause the protein not to be expressed? It shouldn't. The protein should still be expressed but with a mutated HA tag. So the real issue is that when they try to detect it with an HA antibody, it doesn't bind, making it seem like the protein isn't expressed. But the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made at all.

Wait, maybe the HA tag's mutation is causing a problem with the reading frame. Let me see:

The HA's expected DNA is TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA.

But the construct has TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC.

So the first two codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GAC (Asp), etc.

Wait, the third codon in HA is TAC (Tyr), but in the construct, it's CCA (Pro). So the third codon is Pro instead of Tyr. That's a missense. But it's in the same frame, so no frameshift. So the rest of the protein should still be okay.

So the HA is just altered, but the GADD45G is correctly expressed. So the protein should be expressed, but not detected by HA antibodies.

But the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Maybe the construct lacks a promoter. But the question says they transfected it into cells, which suggests the construct has a promoter.

Wait, the provided DNA sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the construct includes the coding sequence, but perhaps it's missing the promoter or other regulatory elements. But the question doesn't mention that; they used Lipofectamine, which is a transfection reagent, so perhaps the construct includes the necessary elements.

Another possibility: the HA tag includes a sequence that's a strong signal for proteasomal degradation. For example, if the HA tag has a PEST sequence or other motifs that target proteins for degradation. But the HA itself isn't known for that, unless the mutation creates such a sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's mutation creates a cryptic splice site or something else in the mRNA, leading to a truncated protein. But that's more about mRNA processing, which isn't mentioned here.

I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Lack of a linker causes proteolysis. So the HA is directly fused to GADD45G. If the linker is missing, perhaps the protein is being cleaved between the HA and GADD45G, leading to no full-length protein. So when they overexpress, the protein is cut into smaller pieces, which might not be detected, making it seem like it's not expressed. But why would the lack of a linker cause proteolysis? Because without a linker, perhaps the HA and GADD45G are not properly folded, leading the protease to cleave the protein.

Alternatively, the HA tag might have a cleavage site. For example, some tags are removed after expression. But without a linker, maybe the HA is causing the protein to be recognized as a target for proteolysis.

But I'm not sure. Back to the initial question: the provided DNA has a TGA at the end, which is a stop codon. So the construct is correctly terminated. The only issue is the HA's sequence.

So the main issue is that the HA has a mutation, making it a missense. So option A is correct.


The researchers are attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an HA tag at the N-terminus. However, they are unable to overexpress the protein as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct reveals that the issue lies in the HA tag sequence. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   The HA tag is supposed to be added to the N-terminus of GADD45G. The expected DNA sequence for the HA tag is `TAC TAC CCA TAC GAT TTA CTG CCA`. However, in the provided construct, the sequence starts with `TAC CCA TAC GAT GAC`, where the third codon (`CCA`) is mutated to `Pro` instead of `Tyr` (`TAC`). This is a missense mutation in the HA tag. While this mutation does not introduce a premature stop codon, it alters the HA sequence, making it unrecognizable for purification using HA-specific antibodies. This could explain why the protein cannot be detected, leading the researchers to conclude that it is not being overexpressed.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   The DNA sequence was analyzed for premature stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). The only stop codon present is at the very end of the sequence (`TGA`), which is the correct termination codon for GADD45G. There are no premature stop codons in the sequence, so this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   A linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G could prevent misfolding or proteolysis. However, the issue here is not proteolysis but rather the inability to detect or express the protein. The HA tag is expressed, but its mutation prevents recognition during purification. This option does not explain the observed problem.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   Stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Since the only stop codon in the sequence is `TGA` at the end, this option is irrelevant and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue is the missense mutation in the HA tag sequence, which alters the tag and prevents proper detection or purification of the protein. This explains why the researchers cannot overexpress or detect the protein as expected.

**Answer: A**
