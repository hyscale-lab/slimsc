Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about comparing the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

So the setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. Small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. B is 1 Tesla. I'm supposed to compare ⟨H⟩, which I think is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic effect, with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen when the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is the wavelength of what? Oh, I remember that's the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. That's the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, n=3 to n=2? Wait, no, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So the H-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, right? I'm a bit rusty on that, but I think that's correct. The wavelength is about 656 nm, but wait, the given value is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Oh wait, that's actually the Balmer-alpha line, which is from n=4 to n=2. Because the Balmer series starts at higher n. So the H-alpha line is indeed about 656 nm, so maybe this is a different line. But regardless, the point is, ΔE is the energy difference corresponding to this wavelength.

So first, I need to calculate ΔE for the hydrogen atom. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h²) * (1/(n²)), where m_e is the electron mass, e is the charge, ε_0 is vacuum permittivity, h is Planck's constant. But maybe it's easier to compute using the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV for the ground state (n=1). The energy levels are E_n = -R / n².

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is the difference between two energy levels. So if the wavelength is λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm, that's 4861 Angstroms. Let me compute the frequency ν using c = λ ν, where c is the speed of light. Planck's equation says E = h ν, so ΔE = hc / λ.

Yes, that's a solid approach. Let me compute that. So h is Planck's constant, 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is 3 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m). Let me calculate that.

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 486.1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 J.

Calculating 1.9878 / 4.861: roughly 0.4088. So ΔE ≈ 0.4088e-18 J.

But wait, converting Joules to eV because it's easier to compare. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 0.4088e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (0.4088 / 0.1602) ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, no, let me correct that: 0.4088e-18 is 4.088e-19 J. Divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV gives approximately 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but hydrogen's energy levels are on the order of 13.6 eV for n=1. So the transition from n=3 to n=2 would have ΔE = E_2 - E_3. E_n = -13.6 / n² eV. So E_2 is -3.4 eV, E_3 is -1.511 eV. So ΔE = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. The magnitude is about 1.89 eV. Hmm, but according to the calculation from wavelength, I got about 2.55 eV. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps my initial approach using wavelength is correct, but wait, maybe the wavelength corresponds to a different transition, not Balmer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, let me do the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 486.1e-9 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 486.1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m.

So hc/λ = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) = 1.9878 / 4.861 * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 /4.861 ≈ 0.4088. So 0.4088e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 0.4088e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (0.4088 / 0.1602) ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but that's higher than the H-alpha line, which is about 1.89 eV. So maybe the wavelength given is for a different transition, like from n=4 to n=2 or something else. But perhaps that's a red herring; the question is about the magnitude, not the specific transition.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV. Wait, but the Balmer-alpha line is at about 486 nm, which corresponds to E_n for n=4 to n=2. So E_2 is -3.4 eV, E_4 is -0.85 eV. ΔE is 2.55 eV. Oh! So that makes sense. So yes, the transition is from n=4 to n=2, which matches the wavelength given. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Okay, now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩? H is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. For paramagnetism, the magnetic interaction is given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. But more accurately, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. And the magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -g μ_B m, where g is the g-factor (approximately 2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m. So the Hamiltonian is H = - μ · B. Since B is in the z-direction, H = - μ_z B.

But wait, for paramagnetic coupling, it's the spin-orbit interaction, but perhaps that's a different term. Alternatively, maybe we're considering the Zeeman effect here. Oh wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. So H = -μ·B.

So, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be for an electron in a particular state with magnetic quantum number m. Wait, but the question says small values of m. So m is small, implying that m is much less than the maximum possible, which for orbital angular momentum is up to l, but perhaps in this case, it's about the spin? Wait, no, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so for a given orbital angular momentum l, m can be -l, ..., l. So small values of m would imply that it's near zero, but perhaps that's not affecting the magnitude much. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the spin magnetic quantum number, but I'm a bit confused. But the question specifies m is small, so perhaps m is close to zero.

But regardless, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m. But wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the energy shift due to the magnetic field in the hydrogen atom, which is the Zeeman effect. So the Zeeman energy is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Or wait, more accurately, the Zeeman shift is given by ΔE = g μ_B m B, where g is the Landé g-factor, but for hydrogen, the ground state, the g-factor is approximately 2. So for hydrogen, the energy shift due to the magnetic field is approximately 2 μ_B m B.

But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = μ·B, but considering the direction, it's H = μ_z B, which would be proportional to m. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m.

Wait, but wait. The paramagnetic coupling term usually refers to the interaction of the spin magnetic moment with the magnetic field. So in that case, the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B S, where S is the spin operator. The expectation value for a state with spin magnetic quantum number s_m would be ⟨H⟩ = -μ_s · B. If the magnetic field is along z, then ⟨H⟩ = -g_s μ_B B s_m.

But wait, the question states that m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so perhaps it's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic coupling refers to the spin-orbit interaction, but that's more about the interaction between spin and orbital angular momentum, not the external field.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between paramagnetism and the Zeeman effect. Let's clarify. The paramagnetic effect for an atom arises from the interaction of its electrons' magnetic moments with an external magnetic field. So for each electron, the magnetic dipole moment is μ = -g μ_B m, where m is the magnetic quantum number (for spin, it's s, but for orbital angular momentum, it's l). So the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B = g μ_B m B.

Wait, but wait: the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum, but I think the exact form depends on the type of moment. For orbital magnetic moment, it's μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_l, where m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number. But if the question is about the paramagnetic coupling, which relates to spin, then μ_spin = g_s μ_B S, where S is the spin angular momentum, and g_s is the spin g-factor (~2).

But the question says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which could be the interaction between the spin and the magnetic field. So the energy would be H = - μ · B. If the magnetic field is along z, then H = -μ_z B = -g μ_B m_s B, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

But wait, the problem statement says 'small values of m', and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Because for a hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number can be up to l, which is n-1. But in the ground state, l=0, so m=0. For the first excited state, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

So if m is small, say m=0, then the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be zero. But if m is small but non-zero, like m=1, but wait, that's only possible if l allows it. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the spin magnetic quantum number, which can only be ±1/2. But the question says m is the orbital quantum number.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed. Let's compute the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So H = μ·B, and μ is (magnetic quantum number) * μ_B.

Wait, for orbital angular momentum, μ = m_l * (eħ)/(2m_e). The expectation value ⟨H⟩ would then be μ * B. So ⟨H⟩ = m_l * (eħ/(2m_e)) * B.

Wait, but that's the energy shift due to the magnetic field. But wait, the term is paramagnetic, so perhaps it's the spin part. So for spin, μ = m_s * g_s μ_B. So the energy would be H = -μ·B = - g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but for hydrogen, the spin of the electron is 1/2, so m_s can be ±1/2.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be ± (1/2) g_s μ_B B.

Given that B is 1 T, and g_s is approximately 2, let's compute this.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is (eħ)/(2m_e). Let me find the value.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

So μ_B = (1.602e-19 C * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg).

Let's compute this:

Numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.693e-53 C·J·s.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So μ_B ≈ 1.693e-53 / 1.8218e-30 ≈ approximately 9.29e-24 J/T.

Wait, but I remember that μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T, so that's correct.

So for spin, H = g_s μ_B m_s B. Since g_s is about 2, and m_s is ±1/2.

So ⟨H⟩ = ± (1/2) * 2 * μ_B * B = ± μ_B * B.

So μ_B * B for B=1 T is 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate the magnitude. So H = -μ·B. For spin up, m_s = +1/2, so H = - ( (1/2) g μ_B ) * B.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, H = -g μ_B m_s B. So with g=2, m_s = ±1/2, B=1 T:

H = -2 * μ_B * (1/2) * 1 T = - μ_B * 1 T.

So the magnitude is μ_B * B = 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but that's the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So ⟨H⟩ is on the order of 9.27e-24 J.

But earlier, ΔE was about 2.55 eV. Let's convert 9.27e-24 J to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. That's 5.79e-5 eV, which is 0.0000579 eV.

Now, ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So comparing ⟨H⟩ and ΔE:

⟨H⟩ ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. How much smaller? Let's see: 2.55 / 5.79e-5 ≈ 44021. So ΔE is about 44,000 times larger than ⟨H⟩.

Wait, that would mean ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. So ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

So the correct option would be C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations?

Wait, when I computed H for spin, I considered m_s = 1/2, but the question says m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is m_l. So for orbital angular momentum, the paramagnetic coupling term would be ⟨H⟩ = μ_l * B, where μ_l is the orbital magnetic moment.

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_l = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (m_l), but wait, the actual expression is μ_l = (μ_B) * m_l, because μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e) * (1/ħ) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of angular momentum. The orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum.

Given that L_z = m_l ħ, so μ_z = (e/(2m_e)) * m_l ħ.

So the energy is H = -μ_z B = -(e/(2m_e)) * m_l ħ B.

Which can be written as H = - ( (eħ)/(2m_e) ) m_l B = - μ_B m_l B.

So for orbital angular momentum, the paramagnetic term is -μ_B m_l B.

Now, m_l can be up to l, but the problem states that m is small, so m_l is small. Let's say m_l is 1, which is the maximum for l=1.

So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * m_l * B.

Wait, but wait: the energy depends on m_l. So for m_l = 1, ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * 1 * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J, same as the spin case when m_s=1/2. So the magnitude is the same as before, around 9.27e-24 J, which is 5.79e-5 eV.

So no matter whether it's spin or orbital, the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.79e-5 eV, which is much smaller than ΔE of 2.55 eV.

So the conclusion is that ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, so option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given setup:

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom. The wavelength of the transition is given as λ = 0.4861 μm. Using the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),

we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m} / 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta E \approx 0.4088 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{0.4088 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For an electron, the magnetic moment is given by:

\[
\mu = g \mu_B m,
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the g-factor (approximately 2 for spin or 1 for orbital angular momentum),
- \( \mu_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_e} \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton,
- \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number (small values are specified in the problem).

The energy shift due to the magnetic field is:

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\mu \cdot B = -g \mu_B m B.
\]

For small \( m \), the magnitude of \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx g \mu_B m B.
\]

Substituting \( g = 2 \), \( \mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \), \( m = 1 \) (maximum small value), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \):

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx (2)(9.27 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) = 1.854 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{1.854 \times 10^{-23}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy is \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), and the paramagnetic coupling term is \( \langle H \rangle \approx 1.16 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \). Comparing the two:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\langle H \rangle} \approx \frac{2.55}{1.16 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 22,000.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \) is approximately 22,000 times larger than \( \langle H \rangle \), meaning:

\[
\langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E.
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**

Answer: C
