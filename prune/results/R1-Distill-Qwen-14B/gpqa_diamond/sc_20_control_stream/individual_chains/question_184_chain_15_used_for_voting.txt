Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break this down piece by piece.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, and the numbering here is a bit tricky. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So in the ring, they are adjacent? Or maybe not. Let me get that right.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and the nitro at 3. So the substituents are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each other. So the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy at 1. Hmm, but how does that affect the synthesis steps?

I need to figure out the order of substituents being introduced. Since benzene is the starting material, I have to go through various electrophilic substitutions. The directing effects of each group will influence where the next substituent attaches.

So, step one: introducing the first substituent. Let's think about the possible options. The substituents are ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). I know that nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, and t-Bu is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group) which is an ortho/para director but due to steric hindrance, may direct more to para.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, tert-butyl chloride would be used with AlCl3 as a catalyst. But Friedel-Crafts is tricky because tert-butyl is a bulky group. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to have issues with very bulky groups because the carbocation can rearrange. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is tert-butyl, which is a tertiary carbocation, so maybe it doesn't rearrange. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to introduce the tert-butyl group via another method, like using a tosylate or something else? Hmm, but the options given seem to have the tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3, which is the standard Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but wait. Nitration is done with HNO3 and H2SO4. Sulfonation with SO3/H2SO4 is another substituent. Ethoxy can be introduced via an ether formation. Let's think about the order. Since ethoxy is a strong activating group, it's better to introduce it early so that subsequent substituents are directed by it. Alternatively, if you introduce a deactivating group early, like nitro, that could block certain positions.

But the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So the order of adding these groups will determine the positions they end up in.

Let me sketch this out. Let's start with benzene.

Option 1: Introduce ethoxy first. Since ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Then introduce the tert-butyl group, which is also activating, and then the nitro group, which is deactivating, meta director.

But wait, since nitro is a meta director, it would be tricky to add it after activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group should be introduced first as a deactivating group, but that would complicate the positions for the other substituents.

Let me think about the positions. The target has the ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and NO2 at 3. So, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The substituents are adjacent to each other. Wait, but that's a bit unusual because in reality, substituents are usually meta or para to each other.

Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Wait, perhaps the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro), so the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions in a way that each is adjacent. But that's a bit crowded. Oh, but the t-Bu is a bulky group, so perhaps it's better to have it in the para position relative to the ethoxy. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitro-1-ethoxybenzene. So, substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So, nitro is at 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1), and t-Bu is at 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1) and adjacent to nitro (position 3). So, that's a possible arrangement.

Now, to plan the synthesis steps. The order of adding substituents matters because each new group will direct the next substitution.

First, let's consider the substituents:

1. Ethoxy (-OEt): Strong activating (ortho/para-directing)
2. tert-Butyl (-C(CH3)3): Weakly activating (ortho/para), but bulky
3. Nitro (-NO2): Deactivating, meta-directing

Since ethoxy is strong activating, perhaps it's best to add it early to direct the other substituents. But nitro is deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions. So, maybe the nitro group should be added last.

Wait, but the substituents are in different positions, so perhaps the order of addition is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro? Or perhaps nitro first, but that would make the ring deactivating, which might complicate adding the other groups.

Alternatively, the nitro group is a meta director, so if added first, the next substituents would go into positions ortho or para to it. But given that the target has the ethoxy and t-Bu in certain positions, perhaps adding the nitro group after the ethoxy and t-Bu would be better.

Alternatively, let's think about the steps each option provides and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps (i to ix). The key steps will be the substitution reactions.

I'll try to map each option's steps to see which sequence makes sense.

Option A:
i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Introducing t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis? Or maybe something else.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → possibly hydrolysis or something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis? Or maybe ethoxy group introduction via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction? Maybe.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of order.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are ethoxy (OEt), t-Bu, and nitro. The ethoxy could be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution (like using an alkoxide), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation, perhaps via a substitution reaction.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituents' positions. The target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So, when adding the substituents, each new group should be added in a position directed by the existing groups.

If the first substituent is ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, then the next substituent (t-Bu) would be in the ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to OEt. But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho to OEt. Then, adding nitro group would require it to be in position 3, which is meta to OEt and adjacent to t-Bu.

But wait, when adding nitro after ethoxy and t-Bu, the existing groups would be OEt and t-Bu. OEt is activating, so it's ortho/para-directing. t-Bu is activating, so ortho/para-directing as well. Where would the nitration occur?

Wait, but nitration is a meta-directing deactivating group. Wait, no, the nitration step uses HNO3 and H2SO4, which is a nitration, which adds a nitro group. But the existing substituents on the ring would direct where the nitro goes.

Wait, but the ring has OEt and t-Bu. Both are activating, so they are ortho/para directors. So when adding the nitro group, it would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but nitro is meta to which substituent? Let's say the ring currently has OEt at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2. When adding nitro, the available positions are 3,4,5,6 (assuming benzene is numbered such that 1 is OEt, 2 is t-Bu). The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, but the current substituents are activating, so the nitro would be directed by the substituents already present.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the order of adding groups.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So first nitro group is added.

Then, ii) Fe/HCl. Wait, Fe in HCl is often used in the reduction of nitro groups (like in the formation of aniline), but that's after nitration.

Hmm, maybe this isn't the right order because adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making subsequent electrophilic substitutions difficult.

But let's think: if I nitrate benzene first, producing nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps nitro is a meta director. Next step is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing agent. But in what context? Maybe reducing a nitro group to an amine? But that's not helping here.

Alternatively, if the first step is nitration, then adding tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts, but nitro is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts difficult because AlCl3 is a catalyst for electrophilic substitution, but the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, I'm not sure if that would work. So perhaps Option D is not the right path.

Looking at Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adding t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+ H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a phenol, but then why? Alternatively, warming with dilute H2SO4 could be a hydrolysis condition for nitro groups to amines, but that's speculative.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps introducing ethoxy via SN2.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

Hmm, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me try to map the steps.

Starting with benzene.

Step i: add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. So benzene becomes t-Bu benzene.

Step ii: nitrate. Now, the t-Bu is an activating group, so the nitration would occur at the ortho or para position relative to t-Bu. So if t-Bu is at position 1, nitration could be at 3 or 4. Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3. So if t-Bu is at 2, then nitro would be at 3 (meta to t-Bu? Or ortho? Wait, t-Bu is activating and ortho/para directing. So nitration would be at ortho or para to t-Bu. So if t-Bu is in position 1, nitration could be in 2 or 4.

Wait, but our target requires nitro in position 3, which would be meta to OEt (position 1). Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is t-Bu in position 2. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu, which is position 2), but wait, that would be meta to where another substituent is.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the order of substituent introduction and their directing effects.

Let me think of the substituents in the target: ethoxy (OEt) at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So when adding substituents, the first group will direct the next one, and the second group will influence the third.

If I add OEt first, then t-Bu would go ortho or para to OEt. Then, nitro would go where?

Alternatively, if I add OEt first, then nitration would occur at meta to OEt, which would be position 3. Then, adding t-Bu would require being in a position that's ortho or para to OEt, but considering the existing nitro group.

Wait, but introducing nitro after OEt would place it in position 3. Then, adding t-Bu would have to go into position 2, which is ortho to OEt and meta to nitro.

Hmm, but let's think about the order: OEt first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Wait, but benzene is OEt at 1. Then nitration would be at 3 (meta to OEt). Then, adding t-Bu would have to be at position 2, which is ortho to OEt. But can that happen? Because after nitration, the ring has OEt (activating) at 1 and nitro (deactivating) at 3.

So when adding t-Bu, the activating group would be OEt at 1, which is ortho/para-directing. The nitro at 3 is deactivating, meta-directing. So the next substitution would be influenced by both groups.

Wait, in such cases, the strongest director (activating) would dominate. So OEt is a strong activating group, so it would direct the incoming t-Bu to its ortho or para positions.

So if OEt is at 1, the t-Bu would go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, t-Bu is at 2.

So first, OEt is introduced into benzene. Then, nitration occurs at 3 (meta to OEt), leading to a 1-OEt, 3-NO2 benzene. Then, adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would go to position 2 (ortho to OEt), but wait, the ring now has OEt at 1 and nitro at 3.

But the ring after OEt and nitro is in positions 1 and 3. The nitro is a deactivating group, so it's not as activating as OEt. So when introducing the t-Bu, the OEt would direct the substitution to its ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). So in this case, t-Bu would go to position 2, which is adjacent to nitro at 3.

So that would place substituents at 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (NO2), which matches the target structure.

So the order would be OEt first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

But looking at the options, I need to see which option follows this order.

Wait, but in the options, the substituents are introduced in different sequences. Let me check each option to see which follows the OEt first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Looking at Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration first.

That's probably not correct because nitro is deactivating and would make Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult for the t-Bu group.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, adding t-Bu first.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Then, the t-Bu is an activating group, so nitration would occur ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say t-Bu is at position 1; nitration would be at 2 or 4.

But in the target, OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So if t-Bu is first at position 1, nitration comes at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But the target has nitro at 3, which is meta to OEt, but in this case, OEt hasn't been added yet. So that's a problem.

So adding t-Bu first, then nitro, would not lead to the correct structure.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Hmm, the sulfonation step (ii) would add a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this is probably not the right path.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → perhaps hydrolysis or another step.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy group.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so steps ii and iii would add nitro and sulfonic acid, which are not in the target. So this is not the correct option.

So, going back, none of the options seem to start with OEt addition. So maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, another approach: The ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. How? Perhaps by having an alkyl halide and doing an SN2 reaction with an ethoxide ion.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, introducing an ethoxy group typically isn't done through an SN2 mechanism. Instead, it's usually introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires activating groups on the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction after some directing groups are in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a benzene ring where an activating group is present, allowing for such a substitution.

Wait, but let me think about the steps in the options. For example, some options have a step where NaOH and EtBr are used (like step vii in option A and B and C and D). That's the Williamson ether synthesis, perhaps, but more likely, it's an SN2 substitution. For example, if the ring has a leaving group like a tosylate, then using NaOH and EtBr would substitute Br with OEt.

But that requires a leaving group already attached to the ring, which would have to be introduced earlier.

So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 substitution, which would require a bromide or other leaving group in the ring.

Wait, but in the initial steps, how would that leaving group get there? It's possible that one of the substituents is a bromide, but that's not part of the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been activated by substituents.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think again about the target structure: OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3.

So the substituents are adjacent to each other. How can this be achieved?

Perhaps, the first substituent is t-Bu. Then, the next substituent is nitro, which is at 3 (meta to t-Bu), but wait, t-Bu is ortho/para directing. So nitro would be at ortho (position 2) or para (position 4), but in the target, nitro is at 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the first substituent is OEt, then nitro is added at 3 (meta to OEt), and then t-Bu is added at 2 (ortho to OEt).

So the order would be OEt → nitro → t-Bu.

But looking at the options, which option does that?

Looking for an option that introduces OEt first. None of the options have OEt as the first substituent. All the options start with t-BuCl/AlCl3 or HNO3.

Wait, but perhaps the OEt is introduced via a substitution after some steps. For example, in option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So in option A, that step would introduce OEt.

So, let's outline Option A's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, the ring has t-Bu and nitro. Nitro is at position 3 (assuming t-Bu is at 1).

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Now, the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but wait, that's typically for aromatic amines. But in this case, after sulfonation, perhaps this step isn't relevant.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to make sense because the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group.

Looking at Option D:

Steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine? So, aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts on aniline? Wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so it would direct substitution.

Wait, if after getting aniline, we do Friedel-Crafts alkylation, t-Bu would be added. But wait, Friedel-Crafts doesn't work on strongly activating rings because the carbocation can't form (due to deactivation by strong activating groups? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts works on activated rings. Aniline is activated, so Friedel-Crafts would proceed.

So, after nitration, reduction gives aniline (NH2 at position 1). Then, Friedel-Crafts adds t-Bu. The NH2 is ortho/para directing, so t-Bu would go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to NH2.

Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. But now, the ring has t-Bu and NH2. Nitration would be directed by NH2 (activating, ortho/para), but it's already at position 1. So nitro would be added at position 2 or 4, but t-Bu is already at position 2 or 4.

Hmm, this seems messy. I'm not sure it would lead to the correct structure.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possibility that the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a bromide. For example, if a bromide is present at a certain position, you can substitute it with ethoxy using NaOH and EtBr.

But how would the bromide get there? It would have to be introduced earlier in the synthesis.

Looking at the options, steps involving NaOH and EtBr are in steps vii (options A, B, C, D). So perhaps in the correct option, the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution after a bromide is present.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a bromide; instead, it has OEt. So the bromide would have to be substituted by OEt.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Introduce a bromide at a certain position.

2. Introduce other substituents.

3. Substitute bromide with OEt.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is introduced via a substitution reaction, not via electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last, via a substitution, using a suitable leaving group.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the steps in each option and see which could possibly lead to the target.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added, probably at position 2 (ortho to NH2).

iv) Nitrate → where? The ring now has NH2 (activating) and t-Bu (activating). Nitration would likely occur at ortho or para to NH2, but if t-Bu is at position 2, and NH2 is at 1, then position 3 is meta to NH2 and adjacent to t-Bu. So nitration could go to position 3.

Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. This would convert NH2 to a diazonium salt. Then, step vi: H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis to form a phenol? Or perhaps introduce another group.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a phenol group. So not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after nitration at position 3, we have nitro groups at 1 and 3. Then, substituting something else.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro first, then t-Bu, then OEt via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the target has three substituents. Let's think about the order that allows each substituent to be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu first. Since it's activating, directs next substituent to ortho or para.

2. Add nitro group in position meta to t-Bu. Wait, no, nitro is deactivating, so it should be added after activating groups.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Add OEt (activating, ortho/para director).

2. Add nitro (deactivating, meta director) → positions 3 or 5 (relative to OEt at 1).

3. Add t-Bu, which would be directed by OEt (ortho or para) and by nitro (meta).

Wait, but if OEt is at 1 and nitro at 3, then t-Bu would go to position 2 (ortho to OEt) or position 4 (para to OEt), but position 4 is para to OEt and meta to nitro (3). So t-Bu could go to 2 or 4.

In the target, t-Bu is at 2, which is ortho to OEt and adjacent to nitro.

So, the order should be OEt → nitro → t-Bu.

But the options don't have OEt introduced first. Let me check the options again.

Looking at all the options, I don't see any that start with OEt. Instead, all the options either start with t-BuCl or nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the OEt is introduced via a substitution step, not via electrophilic substitution.

Wait, for example, if there's a bromide in position 1, and then using NaOH and EtBr would substitute it with OEt.

So, perhaps the steps involve introducing a bromide, then substituting it with OEt.

But how would the bromide be introduced?

Ah, perhaps via a halogenation step, but that would require a directing group. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group to brominate the ring, then substituting Br with OEt.

So, let's think: 

1. Introduce a substituent that directs to the desired position for bromine.

2. Brominate.

3. Substitute Br with OEt.

But I'm not sure if any of the options follow this.

Alternatively, perhaps the OEt is introduced after nitration and alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

- Introduce t-Bu first.

- Then, introduce OEt via substitution.

- Then nitrate.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu.

4. Substitute a bromide with OEt.

But I'm not sure.

Another angle: Looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to NH2).

iv) Nitrate → add nitro at position 3 (meta to NH2, but ortho to t-Bu? Not sure).

Wait, but after adding NH2 and t-Bu, nitration would be directed by NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). So nitro would likely go to position 3 (ortho to t-Bu at 2) or position 4 (para to NH2 at 1).

Alternatively, it could go to position 4, which is para to NH2 and meta to t-Bu.

Hmm, but the target has nitro at position 3.

So, after step iv in option D, nitro would be at position 3.

Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of NH2, which is at position 1.

Wait, but after the nitration in step iv, the ring has NH2 at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. Then, step v would convert NH2 to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol? That would give a phenol group at position 1.

But the target has OEt at position 1. So, after hydrolysis, we have O- at position 1. Then, to make it OEt, perhaps an alkylation step is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps in step vii: NaOH/EtBr → this would perform an SN2 substitution, replacing the hydroxyl group (from the phenol) with OEt.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, after step vi, we have a phenol group (O-) at position 1. Then, step vii would introduce OEt by substituting the OH with OEt.

So, let's map all the steps in option D:

i) Nitration → benzene → nitrobenzene (nitro at 1).

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline (NH2 at 1).

iii) Friedel-Crafts with t-BuCl → add t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to NH2 at 1).

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. The ring has NH2 at 1 and t-Bu at 2. The activating groups (NH2 and t-Bu) would direct nitration. The available positions are 3,4,5,6. NH2 is at 1 (activating, ortho/para), so nitro could go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But t-Bu is at 2, so nitro would go to 4 (para to NH2), but that's position 4, not 3. Alternatively, perhaps nitro is added at position 3, which is meta to NH2 (but NH2 is activating, so meta isn't favored). So this might not lead to the correct position.

Hmm, this seems problematic. Because after step iv, the nitro would be at position 4, not 3.

So, perhaps option D isn't the correct path.

Back to the drawing board. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the nitration steps and the order of substituents.

Alternative approach: The target has OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. The positions are 1,2,3. So, the substituents are adjacent. Let's think about the order in which these substituents can be added such that each is directed properly.

If I add OEt first, then nitro would go to position 3 (meta to OEt). Then, t-Bu would go to position 2 (ortho to OEt).

But how to introduce OEt? Because in the options, OEt isn't introduced first.

Wait, perhaps the OEt is introduced via a substitution reaction using NaOH and EtBr (like step vii in some options). So, to do that, there must be a bromide at the desired position.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce a bromide at the desired position (position 1) via some method.

3. Substitute Br with OEt using NaOH and EtBr.

But in the options, how would that fit?

Looking at option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So, perhaps that's the step where OEt is introduced.

So, let's outline option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added (position 1).

ii) Nitration → nitro added at position 3 (meta to t-Bu, which is activating).

iii) Sulfonation → add SO3 group (position 4?), but target doesn't have that.

Hmm, no, that's not helpful.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu at position 1.

ii) Nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2? So, position 3 becomes NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → where? NH2 is activating, so nitro would go to position 2 or 4.

v) Diazotization → convert NH2 to diazonium.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolyze to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute phenol OH with OEt.

So, after step i: t-Bu at 1.

Step ii: nitro at 3.

Step iii: reduce nitro to NH2 at 3.

Step iv: nitrate again. Now the ring has t-Bu at 1, NH2 at 3. Nitration would be directed by NH2, which is activating. So nitro could go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to NH2 (3).

Assuming it goes to position 2 (ortho to NH2), now the ring has t-Bu at 1, NH2 at 3, nitro at 2.

Step v: diazotization → NH2 at 3 becomes diazonium.

Step vi: H3O+ → hydrolyze to phenol at 3.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr → substitute phenol at 3 with OEt.

So now, the ring has OEt at 3, t-Bu at 1, nitro at 2. But the target has OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration in step iv goes to position 4. Then, the substituents would be t-Bu (1), NH2 (3), nitro (4). Then, substituting NH2 (3) with OEt would give OEt at 3, which isn't the target.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I'm starting to think that the correct option is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the number of nitration steps. The target has only one nitro group. So, options with multiple nitration steps (like options B and D) may not be correct, as it could lead to more nitro groups than desired.

Looking at the options:

Option A has two nitrations (ii and ix).

Option B has nitrations in steps ii and iv.

Option C has steps ii and vi.

Option D has steps i and iv.

Wait, but the target has one nitro group, so the correct option should have only one nitration step. None of the options have only one nitration. Hmm, but that's not possible because some steps may involve other reactions.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced once, but in some options, there are multiple nitration steps. So, that might lead to multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

So, perhaps the correct option is the one where nitration occurs once. But looking at the options, none of them have only one nitration step. So I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the steps in each option:

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro added.

ii) Reduce → NH2.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro.

So, option D results in two nitro groups, which isn't desired. So that's incorrect.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Reduce → NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro.

That adds two nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Sulfonate → SO3 added.

iii) Nitrate → nitro added.

iv) Reduce → something.

v) Diazotize → something.

vi) Nitrate again → another nitro.

Hmm, again, multiple nitro groups.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Sulfonate → SO3 added.

iv) Diazotize → something.

v) acid → something.

vi) H3O+ → something.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → OEt added.

vi) Nitrate again → another nitro.

So, multiple nitro groups.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So all options have multiple nitration steps. That suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group isn't added again but something else. Alternatively, maybe the second nitration step is incorrect, and it's actually another reaction.

Wait, considering that in some steps, nitration is followed by reduction or other steps that remove the nitro group, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is the one where the nitro group is added in the correct position without adding another. But all options have more than one nitration.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct order once again.

The correct order should be:

1. Add ethoxy group first → OEt at position 1.

2. Then, nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to OEt).

3. Then, add t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts → position 2 (ortho to OEt).

So, the sequence would be OEt → nitro → t-Bu.

But looking at the options, none have OEt introduced first. But in option D, the first step is nitration, which would introduce nitro, then reduce to NH2, then add t-Bu, then nitrate again.

But this would result in two nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Wait, but perhaps the nitro group in option D's step i is at position 1, and after reduction, NH2 is at 1. Then, t-Bu is added in position 2. Then, nitrate again at position 3.

So, after step iv in option D, the ring has NH2 at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. Then, step v: diazotization converts NH2 to diazonium. Step vi: H3O+ → phenol at 1. Step vii: NaOH and EtBr → OEt at 1.

So, that would give OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target.

So, in option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu at 2.

iv) Nitrate → nitro at 3.

v) Diazotize → NH2 at 1 → diazonium.

vi) H3O+ → OH at 1 (phenol).

vii) NaOH, EtBr → OEt at 1.

So, that would give the correct structure.

But wait, after step iv, there are two nitro groups: one at 1 and one at 3. Then, when we reduce step v, we're only reducing the nitro at 1 to NH2, but the nitro at 3 remains. Wait, no, because in step ii, we reduced the nitro at 1 to NH2. Then, step iv added nitro at 3, so now the ring has NH2 at 1 and nitro at 3. Then, in step v, we're treating the NH2 at 1 with NaNO2 and HCl, which would convert it to a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis would replace it with OH. Then, step vii would substitute OH with OEt.

So, the final structure would have OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. Which is exactly the target.

But wait, in step iv, the ring has NH2 at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Nitration would occur where? NH2 is activating, ortho/para director. So nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to t-Bu, which is at 2) or position 4 (para to NH2). But depending on the directing, it might end up at 3.

So, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu at 2.

iv) Nitrate → nitro at 3.

v) Diazotize → NH2 at 1 → N2+.

vi) H3O+ → OH at 1.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → OEt at 1.

So, the final structure is OEt(1), t-Bu(2), NO2(3), which matches the target.

So, the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents are introduced in an order that allows proper directing effects on the benzene ring. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The synthesis must follow a logical sequence of steps to achieve this arrangement.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration introduces the nitro group (-NO2) at position 3 (meta to -t-Bu).
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is not part of the target molecule, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration introduces the nitro group (-NO2) at position 3 (meta to -t-Bu).
3. **Step iii**: Reduction converts the nitro group (-NO2) at position 3 to an amine (-NH2).
4. **Step iv**: A second nitration introduces another nitro group, resulting in multiple nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.
5. This option introduces multiple nitro groups and does not match the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is not part of the target molecule, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group (-NO2) at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction converts the nitro group (-NO2) at position 1 to an amine (-NH2).
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) at position 2 (ortho to -NH2).
4. **Step iv**: Nitration introduces the nitro group (-NO2) at position 3 (meta to -NH2 and ortho to -t-Bu).
5. **Step v**: Diazotization converts the amine (-NH2) at position 1 to a diazonium salt.
6. **Step vi**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces it with a hydroxyl group (-OH).
7. **Step vii**: Substitution using NaOH and EtBr replaces the hydroxyl group (-OH) with the ethoxy group (-OEt).

This sequence results in the correct structure: -OEt at position 1, -t-Bu at position 2, and -NO2 at position 3.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The steps ensure proper directing effects and yield the desired product.
