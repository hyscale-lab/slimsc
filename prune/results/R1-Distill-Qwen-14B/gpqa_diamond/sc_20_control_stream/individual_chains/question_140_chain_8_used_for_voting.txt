Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem step by step. I've got to figure out what's going on here, so I'll take it piece by piece.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. Also, there's some info about the melting point of B being close to 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope in one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's break down each part.

First, the reaction releasing gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That probably means W is a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Common gases include O2, H2, maybe NH3, but wait, NH3 isn't a gas in this context. Let me think: the simplest is H2. Or maybe CO2? No, wait. Wait, for CO2: C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. But CO2 would have 22 neutrons (assuming C-12, which has 6 neutrons, and two O-16 which have 8 each. So 6 + 8*2 = 22. Protons: 6 + 16 = 22. Oh! So protons equal neutrons. So CO2 could be W. Or maybe H2O? Let's check: H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2+8=10, neutrons: 0+8*2=8? Wait, that's 8, but 10 protons. No, that doesn't match. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits.

Wait, another option: CH4. Protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons: 6 (from C) +4*2 (from H, which is 0 each) =6. So 10 vs 6. Doesn't work. So CO2 is a good candidate for W.

So gas W is CO2.

Next, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. And B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe water? No, water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). Wait, 277 is 4°C. Hmm, maybe another substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2, but that doesn't make sense because it's a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Wait, maybe G is something like calcium carbonate, which when heated might decompose. But wait, if X is reacting with Y to form a precipitate, perhaps it's a carbonate. Let me think again.

Wait, melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. What about something like a carbonate? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium bicarbonate? No, that's 270-something K. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W (CO2), precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be the metal oxide. The melting point of the metal oxide is about 277 K. Hmm, that's a bit low for a metal oxide. Wait, perhaps B is not a metal oxide but something else. Wait, another thought: maybe B is carbon. But carbon's melting point is higher. Alternatively, could B be sodium bicarbonate (which decomposes upon heating)? Sodium bicarbonate's melting point is around 270 K (like about 300 K?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, another angle: let's think about what X is. The problem says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So possible candidates could be something like a strong base, maybe NaOH? Or perhaps KOH? But wait, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Wait, what about something like Li? No, maybe that's not a reagent used much. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like NH3? No, that's a base but maybe not a reagent in this context. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate? Or a bicarbonate? Or maybe a hydroxide.

Wait, another clue: when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So, the product would be something like a carboxylic acid, perhaps. Wait, no, let me think: a keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. When it reacts with something, maybe a base, the product could be a salt. For example, if a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) reacts with a base, it would form a carboxylate ion. Wait, but the product's formula has two O atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is CO2? Wait, no. Alternatively, the product could be something like a carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to form CO2, a precipitate, and maybe another product. Suppose Y is water. Then, if X is a carbonate, then reacting with water might not make sense. Alternatively, Y could be an acid. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, reacting with an acid would produce CO2 and a salt. But that would make G the salt, perhaps. Then, when G is heated, it might decompose into CO2 and something else. But then what would B be?

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, so the reaction is X + acid → CO2 + precipitate (maybe a metal carbonate reacting with acid to give CO2 and a salt, but that's not a precipitate. Hmm. Or perhaps Y is a base. If Y is a base, and X is a salt, maybe a reaction that forms a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with an acid (like H2SO4) to produce CO2 gas, sodium sulfate (which is soluble, so not a precipitate), and water. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if Y is something else, like maybe a solution of a metal hydroxide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Let's say X is NaOH. Then, if Y is carbon dioxide, the reaction would be 2 NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O. Na2CO3 is a precipitate? No, sodium carbonate is soluble in water. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is a hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has 2 O atoms. So, the product might be something like CO2, but that's just one O atom. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonate, which has three O's. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 O atoms. Maybe the product is a carbonyl group. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. No, but then oxygen count wouldn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, that wouldn't have just two O's either.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, like when a carbonate reacts with a keto acid, but that seems a bit off.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the elements in X.

The question also says that in X, one of the constituent elements has a heavier isotope. So, X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements, meaning that the element must have isotopes. So, possibilities include elements like O, Cl, Na, etc.

Also, the problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, X has two elements, perhaps. Like NaOH (Na and O and H?), but NaOH has three elements. Wait, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So, if X has multiple elements, pick the lightest and heaviest, sum their atomic masses. But wait, the problem says "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Oh, wait, perhaps the wording is that when X has multiple instances of an element, you have to sum all their isotopes' masses. But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's the lightest and heaviest isotopes in X. Wait, no, the wording says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So, for example, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, and H. The lightest is H, heaviest is Na. Then, sum their atomic masses. But wait, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses considering isotopes. Hmm, perhaps I should wait until I figure out what X is.

Going back: the reaction of X with Y gives CO2, a precipitate, which upon heating gives B, with a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, another possibility is that G is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). When heated, NaHCO3 decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be Na2CO3, which has a melting point around 850 K (like 577°C), which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G is something else. Let's think about B's melting point again. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe water ice, but that's 273 K. Hmm, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What about something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's lower. Alternatively, maybe B is something like a carbonate that decomposes into CO2 and a solid with low melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate, but I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the other clues.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is CO2, which has two oxygen atoms, but that would mean X is a base, but that seems odd. Alternatively, the product could be a carbonyl compound.

Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate. Let's say X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Then, reacting with an acid would produce CO2 and sodium salt. But sodium carbonate is soluble, so no precipitate. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal bicarbonate, like sodium bicarbonate. Then, reacting with an acid would produce CO2 and sodium salt, again soluble. Hmm, but the precipitate is G.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid acid, like H2SO4. Then, X is a carbonate, but that might not form a precipitate. Unless X is a carbonate of a metal that isn't very soluble. For example, calcium carbonate reacts with H2SO4 to produce CO2, CaSO4 (which is sparingly soluble?), but I'm not sure. If CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. CaSO4 is slightly soluble, so maybe it precipitates as G. Then, when G (CaSO4) is heated, it might decompose? But CaSO4 has a high melting point. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. Let's say Y is NaOH. Then, X could be CO2. But that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm, not making sense.

Wait, another angle: The product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So, if the keto acid is, say, acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH), reacting with X (maybe a strong base like NaOH) would form a carboxylate. But the product would have more oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, if X is a reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the keto acid to a ketone. But that would require a more complex reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbon source. If a keto acid reacts with X (like carbon), it might form CO2. But that seems a stretch.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and when it reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO2, and a salt which is the precipitate. For example, suppose X is CaCO3 (calcium carbonate). Reacting with H2SO4 would produce CaSO4 (which is slightly soluble, so a precipitate G). Then, when G (CaSO4) is heated, does it decompose? CaSO4 doesn't decompose easily; its decomposition requires high temperatures. So that might not fit.

Back to the melting point of B: 277 K is about 4°C. What about something like ice? But ice's melting point is 273 K. 277 K is a bit higher, so perhaps a different solid. Or maybe a different form of ice, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound entirely.

Wait, another thought: if G is a carbonate and upon heating it releases CO2, then B would be a metal oxide. Let's say, for example, Na2CO3 decomposes into Na2O and CO2. Then, Na2O would be the B. What's the melting point of Na2O? I think it's around 1460°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate. When heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide plus H2O. But again, the metal oxide would have a high melting point.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about what X could be.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Possible candidates: NaOH, KOH, NH3, maybe something like that. But X has a heavier isotope. Wait, perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought: X is a carbonate. Let's say it's sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Then, when it reacts with a liquid Y (maybe an acid), it produces CO2, and a sodium salt. If the sodium salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, if Y is a sulfuric acid, then Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. Now, Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is a liquid base. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two O atoms. Suppose the product is a ketone, which has one O. Or maybe a carbonyl group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate ester or something similar. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a metal bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with a strong acid, like H2SO4, it produces CO2, H2O, and the corresponding sulfate. If the sulfate is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, Ca(HCO3)2 reacts with H2SO4 to form CaSO4 (which precipitates), CO2, and H2O. Then, when CaSO4 is heated, it doesn't decompose easily. So B would be CaSO4, which has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe Y is a base. If X is a carbonate and Y is a base, they might not react. Unless it's a double displacement.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water. If X is a carbonate, maybe it decomposes in water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think about the possible elements in X.

The problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, if X is a diatomic molecule, like O2, but that seems unlikely. Or X could be a compound with two elements, like NaOH (Na, O, H), but that has three elements. Or perhaps X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3), which has Na, C, O. So the lightest element is C (if considering just C, O, Na?), no, C is lighter than O and Na.

Wait, let's think about possible elements in X.

Suppose X is a carbonate, Na2CO3. The elements are Na (atomic number 11, atomic mass ~23), C (12), O (16). The lightest element is C, the heaviest is Na. So their atomic masses sum to 12 +23=35. Looking at the options, option A is 35. So that could be a possibility.

But wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, for Na2CO3, the Na has isotopes, like Na-23 (most common), Na-24, etc. But the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all their isotopes.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate is to take the lightest element's lightest isotope and the heaviest element's heaviest isotope, sum their masses.

For example, in Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O.

Lightest element is C (Z=6, atomic mass ~12).

Heaviest element is Na (Z=11, atomic mass ~23).

So sum is 12 +23=35, which is option A.

But wait, the problem says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that for each element present, all their isotopes are considered, and then you take the lightest and heaviest elements?

Hmm, perhaps for each element in X, we consider the sum of all their isotopes' masses. But that's not the usual approach. Normally, atomic mass is a weighted average based on natural abundance. But perhaps in this problem, they are asking for the sum of all possible isotopes for each element present, then the lightest and heaviest elements are identified based on their atomic numbers, and their total masses summed.

Wait, but isotopes of the same element don't change the element's identity. So for each element in X, sum all the isotopes (their masses), then find the lightest and heaviest elements based on their atomic numbers, not isotopes.

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

So, for each element in X, sum the masses of all isotopes (heavier and lighter). Then, among all elements in X, pick the lightest and heaviest elements, sum their summed masses.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me take an example. Suppose X is Na2CO3.

Elements present: Na, C, O.

For each element:

- Na: sum of all its isotopes' masses. The main isotopes are Na-23 (mass ~23), Na-24 (24), Na-25 (25), etc. But the problem says to sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. But in reality, isotopes have masses like 23, 24, 25, etc. Sum all of them? That's impossible because there are infinitely many isotopes. So perhaps, in the context, only the naturally occurring isotopes are considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: for each element in X, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses and sum them, then proceed.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and they meant to sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element, then add those two sums.

Wait, perhaps the intended approach is to pick the lightest and heaviest elements in X, sum their atomic masses as per their most common isotopes.

So, for X being Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O.

Lightest element: C (12), heaviest: Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

But let me think if there's another possibility. Another possible X could be something else.

Wait, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H.

Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if X is KOH, elements K, O, H. K is 39, sum 39+1=40, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: X is a carbonate with a heavier isotope, but perhaps it's another element. For example, suppose X is MgCO3. Mg has a heavier isotope, Mg-25, Mg-26. The elements are Mg, C, O.

Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Mg (24.3). Sum is 36.3, which is close to option A (35), but not exact. But maybe the question is approximating to whole numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a carbonate but something else. Let's think about another approach.

If the product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms, perhaps it's a carbonate with two O's. Wait, no, carbonate has three O's. Alternatively, maybe the product is CO2, but that's a single molecule with two O's.

Wait, perhaps when a keto acid reacts with X, it forms CO2. So X must be something that can react with a keto acid to produce CO2. For example, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, producing a conjugate base.

Wait, but the product contains two O atoms. So maybe it's a carbonate ion, CO3^2-, but that's three O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has one O. But that doesn't fit two O's. Maybe a diketone? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a methanolic solution, but that's just a guess.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a carbonate ester, like R-O-CO-O-R, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound with two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the product of esterification. For example, a keto acid reacting with an alcohol (X) to form an ester. The ester would have a carbonyl group (O) and an ether linkage (O), so two O's. That could fit.

If X is an alcohol, like methanol (CH3OH), reacting with a keto acid like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH) would produce an ester: CH3COCH2COOCH3. This ester would have two O's (from the ester group). So that fits the clue.

So if X is an alcohol, say methanol, then the product is an ester with two O's. But then, what about the initial reaction with Y?

Wait, but in the initial reaction, X reacts with Y to produce CO2. If X is an alcohol and Y is a carbonate, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a strong acid, but that doesn't fit with the initial reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, reacting with an alcohol Y. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. Let's say X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. The reaction produces CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Let's say X is CO2, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal carbonate. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is something else. Not getting anywhere.

Wait, going back to the first part: gas W is CO2, precipitate G is a carbonate which upon heating gives B. And B's melting point is near 277 K.

Wait, another possibility for B: perhaps B is a bicarbonate. Bicarbonates decompose when heated. For example, NaHCO3 upon heating gives Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But the melting point of NaHCO3 is around 270 K, which is close to 277 K. So that's a possibility.

If B is NaHCO3, then G upon heating gives B. So, G must be something else. Wait, but if G is heated to release B, that seems backward. Wait, perhaps when G is heated, it loses CO2 and becomes B.

Wait, let's think: if G is Na2CO3, heating it doesn't decompose. So that's not it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, if G is NaHCO3, then upon heating, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be Na2CO3, which has a higher melting point.

Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B (a metal oxide) and CO2. But again, the metal oxide would have a higher melting point.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on this part, so let's think differently.

The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If I can figure out what X is, I can find the elements.

Earlier, I thought X could be Na2CO3. So, the elements are Na, C, O.

Sum of lightest (C, 12) and heaviest (Na, 23) is 35, which is option A.

But another option: what if X is something else, like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). The elements are Na, H, C, O.

Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: X is a carbonate of a heavier metal. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Elements are Ca, C, O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum is 52, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, X is potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Elements are K, C, O. Lightest C (12), heaviest K (39). Sum is 51, not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. If X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), then the reaction with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would form a sodium salt of the keto acid's conjugate base. For example, acetoacetic acid reacting with NaHCO3 would form sodium acetate, carbon dioxide, and water. The product (sodium acetate) has O's, but the question says the product has two O atoms. Sodium acetate is CH3COONa, which has two O's in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So, if X is NaHCO3, then the elements are Na, H, C, O.

Lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, not an option. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought X was Na2CO3. Let's consider that.

X is Na2CO3. Reacting with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH). Reacting with Na2CO3, which is a base, would deprotonate the keto acid to form the conjugate base and release CO2. The product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid's conjugate base. The product would have more O's, not two.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the product is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl chloride. For example, if X is COCl2, but that's not a common reagent.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate, and the keto acid is something that upon reaction releases CO2 and forms a salt with two O's. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me summarize what I have so far.

From the question, I think X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3) because when it reacts with an acid, it releases CO2. The precipitate G would be the salt formed, but in the case of Na2CO3 and H2SO4, the product is Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is CO2. But then X would be a gas, not a solid, and the reaction would be different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH, Y is CO2. The reaction would be 2 NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O. But Na2CO3 is soluble, so no precipitate.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate and X is a hydroxide. Not sure.

At this point, I'm not making much progress on the reaction, but perhaps the key is to focus on the part about the elements in X.

If I consider the options, option A is 35, which would be 12 (C) +23 (Na) =35.

So, if X is Na2CO3, that gives me the sum of 35.

Now, the fact that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements: Na has isotopes (like Na-24, Na-25). So that fits.

The product of a keto acid with X would have two O's. If X is Na2CO3, and the product is sodium carbonate (same as X), that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the product is a salt with two O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is CO2, which has two O's. So, when a keto acid reacts with X (Na2CO3), it produces CO2. That would fit the two O's in the product.

Yes, because when a keto acid reacts with a carbonate, it would release CO2. So for example, acetoacetic acid reacting with Na2CO3 would produce CO2 and the corresponding sodium salt. So the product has CO2, which has two O's.

That fits the clue.

So, putting it all together, X is Na2CO3. The elements present are Na, C, O.

Lightest element: C (12).

Heaviest element: Na (23).

Sum: 12+23=35, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to release gas W (CO₂), forms a precipitate G, and releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the product of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):** The molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons, confirming it is CO₂. This indicates that X reacts with Y to produce CO₂.

2. **Precipitate G and B:** When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests G is likely a carbonate, and B could be a metal oxide or bicarbonate. However, the exact identity of B is less critical to solving the problem.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid:** The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests that X could be a carbonate, as carbonates release CO₂ upon reaction with acids or bases, leaving behind a salt or precipitate.

4. **Identity of X:** Based on the clues, X is likely sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). Sodium carbonate is a common reagent in organic chemistry, reacts with acids to release CO₂, and fits the description of incorporating a heavier isotope (e.g., Na-24 or Na-25).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses:** Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) contains the elements sodium (Na), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass ~12), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23). The cumulative atomic masses of these two elements sum to 12 + 23 = 35.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 35, corresponding to carbon (C) and sodium (Na). This matches option A.

**Answer: A**
