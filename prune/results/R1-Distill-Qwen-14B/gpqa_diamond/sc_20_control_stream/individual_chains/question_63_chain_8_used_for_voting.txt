Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule consisting of elements X and Y. They've given me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon needed to switch it to the next possible state.

Hmm, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, unlike the rigid rotor model where the bond length doesn't change, in this model, the bond can stretch, allowing for vibrational energy levels as well as rotational.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). But wait, do rotational and vibrational states have to change together when a photon is absorbed? Or can they change independently?

Wait, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy changes. The energy transitions in a diatomic molecule are usually considered in terms of both rotational and vibrational energy changes. But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so maybe it's the lowest possible energy state, which would be the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So in this case, the initial state is v=0 and J=0.

But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. The next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so what's the next possible state after the fundamental? Well, the next state would probably be the first excited state, but I'm not sure whether that's a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, in terms of energy, vibrational states have a much higher energy spacing than rotational states. Because vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, and rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Since w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is quite high, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones.

So, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher energy state. Since rotational transitions can be lower in energy than vibrational transitions, but wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. Let me see, the moment of inertia is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So the rotational constant B is ħ/(2I), but I think more accurately, B is (h)/(8π² I c), if we're talking about rotational energy in terms of spectroscopy. Wait, maybe I should look at how the energy levels work.

But wait, the question is asking about the photon's momentum. The energy of the photon will cause a transition from the current state to the next. Since the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the photon must provide enough energy to reach the next possible state. But what's the next state possible? The molecule can go to higher vibrational or higher rotational states.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are considered together. So the energy levels are more complex. But for the transition, the photon needs to provide the energy difference between two adjacent states.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can either change its vibrational state or its rotational state when absorbing a photon. But which transition would require the least energy? Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should be the minimal possible to cause any transition.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model (which is the simpler case), transitions between rotational states are allowed, and their energy differences are much smaller than those for vibrational transitions. However, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels account for both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels might be a combination of both.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next state in the energy hierarchy. Let's consider the possible transitions.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the problem is considering a pure rotational transition, a pure vibrational transition, or a combination. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but in the ground rotational state (J=0). So the next state could be J=1, which is a higher rotational state. Alternatively, the next state could be v=1.

But considering that the rotational energy levels are lower in energy than the vibrational ones (since B is small), the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is less than the energy difference between v=0 and v=1. So the photon required to cause a rotational transition would have a lower energy than one needed for a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So perhaps that's the ground state for both vibrations and rotations. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1). But which transition requires less energy?

Let me compute the energy differences.

First, calculate the vibrational energy difference. The energy between v=0 and v=1 is delta E_vib = E_vib(1) - E_vib(0) = [ (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) ] h w = (1) h w.

So delta E_vib = h w, where h is Planck's constant.

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and w is 4e14 rad/s. So delta E_vib = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot(J) = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant, which can be expressed as B = h/(8 pi² I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula is E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) J (J + 1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, let me think. The rotational energy levels in terms of the moment of inertia I are E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2 I), where J is the rotational quantum number.

But ħ is h/(2 pi), so ħ² = h²/(4 pi²). So E_rot = [ J (J+1) * (h²/(4 pi²)) ] / (2 I) ) = [ J (J+1) h² ] / (8 pi² I )

The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = [ (1*2) h²/(8 pi² I) ) ] - 0 = (2 h²)/(8 pi² I) ) = h²/(4 pi² I )

So delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )

I is the moment of inertia, which is for a diatomic molecule, I = mu R², where mu is the reduced mass.

So, mu is (m_x * m_y)/(m_x + m_y). The masses are given in amu, so I need to convert them to kg.

Wait, the mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So mu = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 20/11 is approximately 1.818. So mu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.023e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = mu * R² = 3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.023e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 2e-10 squared is 4e-20. So yeah, 3.023e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.209e-46 kg m².

Now, compute delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

So, delta E_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4 * pi² * 1.209e-46 )

Let me compute the denominator: 4 * (pi^2) ≈ 4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.478.

So denominator is 39.478 * 1.209e-46 ≈ 47.7e-46 = 4.77e-45.

So delta E_rot ≈ 4.39e-67 / 4.77e-45 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that's 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier, the vibrational energy delta E was 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition energy is much smaller than the vibrational.

But wait, that seems way off. Because I thought that the vibrational energy transitions are higher than rotational ones. So, the delta E for a rotational transition is much smaller than the vibrational. So, if the molecule is in the J=0 state, it can absorb a photon with energy equal to delta E_rot and transition to J=1. Alternatively, it could go from v=0 to v=1, which would require a much higher energy.

But what is the next state with the lowest possible energy? Since the next rotational state (J=1) requires less energy than the next vibrational state (v=1), the molecule would preferentially transition to J=1 before v=1. But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So the next possible state is the first excited state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But since J=1 requires less energy, that transition would occur if the photon's energy is sufficient for the J=1 transition. But if the photon's energy is enough for both, but the question is about the minimal possible photon energy, so the photon would cause the transition to the next state, which is the J=1 state.

Wait, but the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the next state in the ordering of energy levels. Since the rotational state J=1 is lower in energy than the vibrational state v=1, the next state would be J=1, because it's the lowest possible higher energy state.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

But wait, in some models, the energy levels are treated as a combination of rotation and vibration. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the energy difference between the (v=0, J=0) state and the next possible state, which could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Whichever requires the least energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model allows transitions that change both J and v. But in that case, the minimal energy transition would be J=0 to J=1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which would require the photon to have energy delta E_rot.

But wait, another thing to consider is that in the rotation-vibration coupling, the energy levels might be quantized in a way that combines both. However, for simplicity, perhaps the problem assumes that the next state is the first rotational state. Or maybe the problem is actually considering a vibration transition, but that's the next possible higher energy state. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the energy levels.

Let me compute both energy differences.

Vibrational delta E: 2.65e-19 J.

Rotational delta E: 9.2e-23 J.

So, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon that the molecule absorbs would need to have energy equal to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), then the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Between these two, which has lower energy? Let's compute the energy of each.

The energy of (v=0, J=1) is E_rot(1) + E_vib(0) = (B * 1 * 2) + ( (0 + 1/2) h w )

Wait, but for the non-rigid rotor model, the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib.

So, E_rot(J) = B J (J+1), and E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2) h w.

So, E(v=0, J=0) = 0 + (1/2) h w.

E(v=0, J=1) = B * 2 + (1/2) h w.

E(v=1, J=0) = 0 + (3/2) h w.

So, comparing E(v=0, J=1) and E(v=1, J=0):

E(v=0, J=1) = B * 2 + (1/2) h w.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) h w.

Which one is lower?

If (B *2 ) + (1/2) h w ) < (3/2) h w, then E(v=0, J=1) is lower.

So, 2 B < (3/2 h w - 1/2 h w) ) → 2 B < h w.

Is that true? Let's compute B and h w.

Earlier, I computed delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I) ) = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but B is the rotational constant, which is E_rot(J) = B J (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot is 2 B. Wait, but in the calculation above, delta E_rot is 2 B (since J goes from 0 to 1, the difference is 2 B).

So delta E_rot is 9.2e-23 J = 2 B → B = 4.6e-23 J.

Then, what is h w? h is 6.626e-34 J·s, w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So, 2 B = 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J.

So 2 B = 9.2e-23 J is much less than h w (2.65e-19 J). So indeed, E(v=0, J=1) = 2 B + (1/2 h w) ) = 9.2e-23 + (5.3e-19/2) → 9.2e-23 + 1.325e-19 J ≈ 1.325e-19 J.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) h w = 3.975e-19 J.

So E(v=0, J=1) is lower than E(v=1, J=0), meaning that the (v=0, J=1) state has lower energy than (v=1, J=0). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon energy of delta E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait another thing. The molecule is initially in (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the first excited state, which would have the next available energy level. If (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0), then yes, it's the next state. Therefore, the photon needs to supply 9.2e-23 J of energy.

But wait, the question is asking for the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, because the options are given in momentum units.

Wait, photons have energy E = p c, where p is momentum, and c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

So, if the energy is 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, that seems very small. None of the options are that small. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 N*s
B) 2.3e-27 N*s
C) 1.1e-27 N*s
D) 1.4e-28 N*s

Wait, N·s is the same as kg·m/s. So the photon's momentum would be in kg·m/s, which is the same as N·s.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the momentum is about 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s. None of the options are that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the transition.

Hmm, maybe I should go back and reevaluate. Perhaps the next state is not a rotational transition, but a vibrational one. Because if the problem is about the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), the next state might be (v=1, J=0). Maybe the question expects the vibrational transition.

Wait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational changes. But in the rigid rotor model, which this is similar to, the vibrational energy is considered separately.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transitions typically involve a change in v by ±1, while rotational transitions involve a change in J by ±1 or ±2. But the selection rules might affect which transitions are allowed.

But even if a rotational transition is allowed, the energy required is much less than a vibrational transition, so the photon needed for a rotational transition would have less energy.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so the next state with the lowest possible energy would require the minimal possible photon energy. So the minimal energy would be a rotational transition, which is smaller than a vibrational one.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which would give a momentum of 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s → 3e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are that low. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference again.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula for B. Let me clarify.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot(J) = (ħ² / (2 I)) J (J+1). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ²/(2 I)) (2) ) → (ħ² * 2) / (2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, correct, so delta E_rot = ( ħ² ) / I.

Wait, ħ is h/(2 pi). So ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

So delta E_rot = (h²/(4 pi²)) / I.

Ah, earlier I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but let's recompute the moment of inertia I.

I = mu R^2, where mu is the reduced mass.

Mass X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converting to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.022e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

So delta E_rot = (h^2) / (4 pi² I )

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 / (4 pi² * 1.209e-46 )

Compute denominator: 4 pi² ≈ 39.478.

39.478 * 1.209e-46 = approx 4.76e-45.

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.76e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So that's about 9.22e-23 J, which is correct.

So the momentum is p = E / c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But wait, the options are all much larger than that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the next state is a combination of both a rotational and vibrational transition. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational state, and just wants the photon to cause a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1.

In that case, the energy difference is delta E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 → 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum would be p = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is a bit lower. But wait, 8.8e-28 isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state (v=1, J=0), which is the first vibrational excited state. That would require delta E_vib = h w.

In that case, the momentum p would be 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is approximately 8.8e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28, but that's about a quarter of the value I calculated. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute delta E_vib.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So delta E_vib is h * w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, p = E / c → 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.834e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both a rotational and a vibrational change. Wait, but the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the least energy increase. So that would be the rotational transition, which requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the moment of inertia is calculated with the average bond length, but perhaps it's considering the bond's length in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, let me recalculate mu again.

mu = (m_x * m_y) / (m_x + m_y) )

m_x = 20 amu, m_y = 2 amu.

mu = (20 * 2) / (22) ) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed because the selection rules require a change in J of ±1, but for the molecule to transition from J=0 to J=1, which is allowed. So that's fine.

But why don't the options match the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rigid rotor model, which ignores the vibrational energy and focuses only on rotational transitions.

Wait, but the question says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So the energy includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to go from the (v=0, J=0) state to (v=0, J=1). The energy difference is delta E_rot = 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 N·s, but again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me double-check.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

mu is 20/11 amu = approx 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

mu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg → approx 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

So I = mu * R² → 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.02e-27 *4e-20 → 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for delta E_rot. Let me recheck.

E_rot(J) = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I )

So delta E between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = ( ħ² * 2 )/(2 I ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, ħ is h/(2 pi), so ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

So delta E_rot = (h²/(4 pi²)) / I → h^2/(4 pi² I )

Yes, that's correct.

h² is (6.626e-34)^2 → about 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 pi² I → 4 * (9.87) * 1.208e-46 → 4*9.87 ≈39.48 → 39.48 * 1.208e-46 ≈47.6e-46 → 4.76e-45.

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 /4.76e-45 → ~9.22e-23 J.

Hmm, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 and v=0 to v=0, and the momentum is calculated using the rotational energy, but the options are not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the transition to the next state with the next possible energy, which would be a vibrational transition, but in that case the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused energy and momentum somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the momentum of a photon is p = E_photon / c.

Wait, but E_photon = delta E, which is either 9.2e-23 J (rotational) or 2.65e-19 J (vibrational).

So for the rotational case: p =9.2e-23 /3e8 → 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

Vibrational case: 2.65e-19 /3e8 → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of the vibrational value. Option D is 1.4e-28, also lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps the energy is not delta E, but some multiple of that. For example, in vibrational transitions, sometimes the selection rules allow for changes in v by ±1, but perhaps if the molecule is in the ground state, it can't go beyond v=0. No, the ground state is v=0, so the first transition is to v=1.

Another possibility is that the model is considering the transition not from (v=0, J=0), but to the next state which is (v=0, J=1), but perhaps I have to include the vibrational energy as well.

Wait, no, in the (v=0, J=1) state, the energy is E_rot + E_vib. E_rot is 2B and E_vib is (1/2)hw.

So, the energy difference from (v=0, J=0) is 2B + (1/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )? No, that's not correct. The initial state is (v=0, J=0), which has E = E_rot(0) + E_vib(0) → 0 + (1/2)hw.

The final state is (v=0, J=1), which has E = E_rot(1) + E_vib(0) → 2B + (1/2)hw.

So the energy difference is (2B + ½ hw) - (½ hw) )= 2B.

So the delta E is 2B = 9.2e-23 J, same as before.

But why is the photon's momentum not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0). So the delta E is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

So the photon's energy would be h w, and the momentum p = h w / c = 6.626e-34 *4e14 / 3e8 → (2.65e-19 ) / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, which are lower than this. Hmm, but none match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational delta E. Let me recalculate delta E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy includes the vibrational effects, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the rotational constant B and then compute the energy.

The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I c ), but perhaps I should use a different formula.

Wait, another formula for B is:

B = (h)/(8 pi² I c )

Wait, no, I think that's for the rotational constants in spectroscopy, where the energy is expressed in terms of wavenumbers.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps the energy in joules is E_rot = h c B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^-1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try an alternative approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the photon's momentum that causes a transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which requires delta E = 2B.

But again, I don't see how that would match the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of the energy. Let's see:

If delta E = 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s, which are much bigger.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of I. Wait, R is in angstroms, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, correct. mu is 3.02e-27 kg, correct.

Wait, perhaps in the formula for delta E_rot, I should have used I in different units. Wait, no, I think that was correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me think again. B is the rotational constant defined as:

B = ħ²/(2 I )

So E_rot = B J (J+1 )

But delta E_rot from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

So B = ħ²/(2 I ) → delta E_rot = 2 * ( ħ²/(2 I )) )= ħ²/I.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, let me compute ħ.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s → ħ = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68 J² s².

So delta E_rot = ħ² / I = 1.113e-68 / 1.209e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J. Same result as before.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational transition, but that would give 8.8e-28 N·s, which is bigger than any of the options except option B and C.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A:1.9e-28

Option B:2.3e-27

Option C:1.1e-27

Option D:1.4e-28

Wait, 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires delta E = h w.

So p = h w / c.

h=6.626e-34 J·s, w=4e14 rad/s.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, this isn't matching any of the options exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state with the next possible energy, which would involve a change in both v and J. But that would require more energy, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the expression for the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the bond as variable, thereby changing the moment of inertia. But in that case, the calculation would be more complicated, involving both vibrational and rotational transitions. But I'm not sure how that would affect the energy required.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition to a higher vibrational state, but I don't see how that would be lower in energy than the rotational transition.

Another possibility: perhaps the mass given is in atomic mass units, but I forgot to convert them to kilograms correctly. Let me check.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mu = 20 * 2 / (20 + 2 ) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

So mu in kg is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor approximation, which would not include the vibrational energy. But the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the next state is (v=0, J=1). Maybe the next state is (v=1, J=0), which requires more energy, but perhaps that's the only allowed transition.

But that would make the required photon energy much higher, as we saw earlier.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum ~3e-31 N·s, and the vibrational transition requires ~8.8e-28 N·s. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 1.1e-27 N·s. That's about 1e-27, which is about 1e4 times larger than the vibrational case. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me re-calculate I.

mu is 3.02e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = mu * R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as the sum of the individual moments? No, that's not correct; the correct formula is I = mu R².

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit? But no, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. Or perhaps they're using the formula for the rotational energy as B J (J+1), where B is expressed in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the expression for B in terms of the vibrational parameters. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering the rotational transition, and the given options are based on that, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 9.2e-23 J is 9.2e-23 kg·m²/s². Momentum is kg·m/s.

So p = E/c → 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h/(8 pi² I c).

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula for B in terms of spectroscopic units (wavenumbers), but when I use this B, then E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

Wait, let me compute B as h/(8 pi² I c).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.209e-46 *3e8 )

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 78.96.

78.96 * 1.209e-46 = 9.55e-45.

9.55e-45 * 3e8 = 2.866e-36.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 2.866e-36 ≈ 2307 cm^-1.

But that's in spectroscopic terms. Then, the rotational energy in joules is E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

Wait, no, if B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1), then E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

h c is about 1.986e-25 J·cm.

So E_rot = 1.986e-25 J·cm * 2307 cm^-1 * J (J+1).

For J=1, E_rot = 1.986e-25 *2307 *2 →  approx 9.2e-22 J.

Which aligns with our previous calculation of delta E_rot being about 9.2e-23 J. Hmm, wait, wait. No, 2307 cm^-1 is for B, but when J=1,

E_rot = h c B (1)(2) = 1.986e-25 J·cm * 2307 cm^-1 *2 → 1.986e-25 * 2307 *2 = 9.2e-22 J.

Which is about 10 times larger than our previous delta E_rot value of 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but that's contradictory. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, because if B is in cm^-1, then the energy E_rot would be E = h c B J (J+1).

So for J=1, E_rot = 1.986e-25 * 2307 * 2 = 9.2e-22 J. But earlier, when I calculated delta E_rot as 9.2e-23 J, I think I confused B and E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula.

Wait, the rotational constant B is usually expressed in cm^-1, where B = h/(8 pi² I c ). So with I = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

Let me compute B again.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

8 pi² I c = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.209e-46 kg·m² * 3e8 m/s.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.209e-46 = 9.55e-45.

9.55e-45 *3e8 = 2.866e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.866e-36 ≈ 2307 cm^-1.

Then, E_rot for J=1 is E_rot = h c B J(J+1) → 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s * 2307 cm^-1 * 2.

Wait, but units: 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So E_rot = h c B J (J+1) → E_rot = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e10 cm/s) * (2307 cm^-1) * 2.

Wait, the cm in 3e10 cm/s and 2307 cm^-1 will cancel out.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 2307 * 2 → compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e10 = 1.9878e-23.

1.9878e-23 * 2307 = 4.58e-20.

4.58e-20 * 2 =9.16e-20 J.

So delta E_rot is approximately 9.16e-20 J.

Wait, that's a different value than before. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Hmm.

Now, the photon's energy would be 9.16e-20 J, and the momentum p = E/c → 9.16e-20 /3e8 =3.05e-28 kg·m/s → 3.05e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is a bit lower but in the same order of magnitude.

But I'm getting a bit confused here because different approaches give me different results. It seems I might have made a mistake in the earlier calculation, perhaps mixing up different units or formulas.

Another approach: perhaps the correct energy to consider is the vibrational energy, which would give a higher momentum. Let me compute that again.

Delta E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

None of the options match this, so perhaps the problem is expecting the rotational energy, and the correct option is D:1.4e-28 N·s, which is close to 1.4e-28.

But according to my most recent calculation, I get 3e-28 N·s. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try calculating B once more.

B = h/(8 pi² I c )

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

I=1.209e-46 kg·m².

c=3e8 m/s.

So 8 pi² I c =8 * (9.8696) * 1.209e-46 *3e8.

Compute 8 *9.8696 → about 78.9568.

78.9568 *1.209e-46 ≈9.55e-45.

9.55e-45 *3e8 →2.865e-36.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.865e-36 → approx 2307 cm^-1.

Now, E_rot for J=1 is E_rot = h c B J(J+1) → h=6.626e-34, c=3e8 m/s, B=2307 cm^-1.

But to compute E_rot, let's convert B into m^-1.

B in m^-1 is 2307 cm^-1 * (1 m / 100 cm) )= 23.07 m^-1.

So E_rot =6.626e-34 *3e8 *23.07 * 2 →6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *23.07 =4.58e-24.

4.58e-24 *2=9.16e-24 J.

So delta E_rot is 9.16e-24 J.

Then, p=9.16e-24 /3e8 =3.05e-32 kg·m/s →3.05e-32 N·s.

Hmm, that's even smaller than before. I'm getting inconsistent results, which suggests I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me compute the rotational energy difference using the formula E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1).

So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

So delta E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ² / I.

Compute ħ² = (h/(2 pi))² → (6.626e-34 /6.2832)^2 → approx (1.055e-34)^2 →1.113e-68 J² s².

I =1.209e-46 kg·m².

So delta E_rot =1.113e-68 / 1.209e-46 → approx 9.21e-23 J.

Then, p =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't include anything that small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of both the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would require even more energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration, and the next state is the first state with higher energy, which is a combination of both. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which requires a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J, but the options don't have that.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the momentum, which is p = E/c.

But perhaps the energy required is the vibrational energy, which is h w, and the momentum is (h w)/(c).

Which would be (6.626e-34 *4e14 ) /3e8 → (2.65e-19)/(3e8) →8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about 4.6 times smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the rigid rotor model and only considering rotation, and the answer is option D:1.4e-28 N·s.

Wait, 1.4e-28 is about 1.6e-28, which is roughly 0.16e-27, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using the rotational energy in J and calculate p.

But I'm really stuck here. None of the options match my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy, and I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute p again.

E =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 / 3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is the rotational transition, but the answer is not among the options, which suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational delta E. Let me compute it again.

Compute I = mu R².

mu =20*2/(20+2) amu =40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

mu =1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.022e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I =3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.022e-27 *4e-20 =1.209e-46 kg·m².

Compute delta E_rot = (h²)/(4 pi² I )

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

4 pi² I =4*(9.8696)*1.209e-46 ≈4*9.8696=39.478; 39.478 *1.209e-46=47.6e-46=4.76e-45.

So delta E_rot=4.39e-67 /4.76e-45≈9.22e-23 J.

p=9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

Hmm, no match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia with the sum of the masses instead of the reduced mass. Let me compute that.

I = m_x * m_y * R²/(m_x + m_y) → that's the same as mu * R², which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as (m_x + m_y) R², which would be incorrect. Let me see:

If I = (20 +2) amu * (2e-10 m )^2 → 22 amu →22 *1.66e-27 kg →3.65e-26 kg.

I =3.65e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2=3.65e-26 *4e-20=1.46e-45 kg·m².

Then delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )=4.39e-67/(4 pi² *1.46e-45 )=4.39e-67/(4*9.87*1.46e-45 )=4.39e-67/(5.87e-45 )=7.48e-23 J.

p=7.48e-23/3e8=2.49e-31 N·s. Still way below the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27 N·s, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated as p = sqrt(2mE), but that's for a classical treatment, which doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum from the kinetic energy.

Wait, photon's energy is E =pc, so p= E/c.

So, if the required energy is delta E_rot =9.2e-23 J, p=3.07e-31 N·s.

Alternatively, for delta E_vib=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't match either.

Wait, looking at option C:1.1e-27 N·s.

Hmm, 1.1e-27 is about 1e-27, which is 1e20 times larger than 1e-31. So perhaps the problem is considering a transition that I'm not accounting for.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next possible state, which includes both a rotational and vibrational change. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which requires delta E = h w.

p= h w /c =6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8=2.65e-19/3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next state in terms of rotational energy, which is (v=0, J=1), so delta E_rot=9.2e-23 J, p=3e-31 N·s.

But without any option matching, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as I = (m_x + m_y) R².

Let me compute that.

m_x + m_y =20 +2=22 amu=22 *1.66e-27 kg=3.65e-26 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I=3.65e-26 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.65e-26 *4e-20=1.46e-45 kg·m².

Then, delta E_rot = (h²)/(4 pi² I )=4.39e-67/(4 pi² *1.46e-45 )=4.39e-67/(5.87e-45 )=7.48e-23 J.

p=7.48e-23/3e8=2.49e-31 N·s.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as I = m_x m_y R²/(m_x + m_y ), which is correct.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

I think I'm stuck and might have to make an educated guess. Considering that the rotational transition requires less energy, and perhaps the problem expects that, but the options don't have that value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Among the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of the vibrational p I calculated. So maybe there's an error in the problem statement or the options.

But without further information, I'll have to make a choice. Since the vibrational transition requires higher energy and the rotational requires lower, and the question asks for the minimal possible energy, the rotational transition is the correct one. However, none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vibrational energy calculation. Let me check.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, none match this exactly, but perhaps I should choose the closest option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B:2.3e-27 N·s. That's about 2.6e-27, which is much larger than our calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute p = (hbar w)/(c), since sometimes in quantum mechanics, they use ħ instead of h.

E = ħ w = (h/(2 pi)) * w.

So E = (6.626e-34 /6.283) *4e14 → approx (1.055e-34) *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p=4.22e-20 /3e8=1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is close to option D:1.4e-28 N·s.

Ah! That's option D.

Wait, so perhaps I should have used ħ instead of h. Let me see.

Yes, because in quantum mechanics, the energy for a photon is often written as E = ħ ω, where ω is the angular frequency.

Yes! So the correct calculation is E_photon = ħ w.

So E_photon = (h/(2 pi)) * w.

Then, p = E_photon / c = (h/(2 pi c)) * w.

So let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 / (2 *3.1416 )) *4e14 → (6.626e-34 /6.2832 ) *4e14 → approx (1.055e-34 ) *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p=4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D:1.4e-28 N·s.

Ah, that's the correct approach! I should have used ħ instead of h in the photon energy calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \(v=0\) and the lowest rotational state \(J=0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a rotational transition (\(v=0, J=1\)) or a vibrational transition (\(v=1, J=0\)). The energy required for these transitions is calculated, and the photon's momentum is derived from the energy difference.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (\(\mu\)):**
   The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y}
   \]
   Substituting \(m_X = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), and \(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (\(I\)):**
   The moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule is given by:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2
   \]
   Substituting \(\mu = 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) and \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   I = 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.209 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)):**
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}}(J) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1),
   \]
   where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\). The energy difference between \(J=0\) and \(J=1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(1) - E_{\text{rot}}(0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(I = 1.209 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.209 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}}(v) = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega,
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\). The energy difference between \(v=0\) and \(v=1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum:**
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c},
   \]
   where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]
   For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the calculated values match the provided options. The closest match to the vibrational transition is **Option D: \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)**, which aligns with the use of \(\hbar\) instead of \(h\) in the energy calculation. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule consisting of elements X and Y. They've given me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon needed to switch it to the next possible state.

Hmm, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, unlike the rigid rotor model where the bond length doesn't change, in this model, the bond can stretch, allowing for vibrational energy levels as well as rotational.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). But wait, do rotational and vibrational states have to change together when a photon is absorbed? Or can they change independently?

Wait, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy changes. The energy transitions in a diatomic molecule are usually considered in terms of both rotational and vibrational energy changes. But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so maybe it's the lowest possible energy state, which would be the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So in this case, the initial state is v=0 and J=0.

But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. The next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so what's the next possible state after the fundamental? Well, the next state would probably be the first excited state, but I'm not sure whether that's a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, in terms of energy, vibrational states have a much higher energy spacing than rotational states. Because vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, and rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Since w is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is quite high, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones.

So, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher energy state. Since rotational transitions can be lower in energy than vibrational transitions, but wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. Let me see, the moment of inertia is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So the rotational constant B is ħ/(2I), but I think more accurately, B is (h)/(8π² I c), if we're talking about rotational energy in terms of spectroscopy. Wait, maybe I should look at how the energy levels work.

But wait, the question is asking about the photon's momentum. The energy of the photon will cause a transition from the current state to the next. Since the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the photon must provide enough energy to reach the next possible state. But what's the next state possible? The molecule can go to higher vibrational or higher rotational states.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are considered together. So the energy levels are more complex. But for the transition, the photon needs to provide the energy difference between two adjacent states.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can either change its vibrational state or its rotational state when absorbing a photon. But which transition would require the least energy? Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should be the minimal possible to cause any transition.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model (which is the simpler case), transitions between rotational states are allowed, and their energy differences are much smaller than those for vibrational transitions. However, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels account for both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels might be a combination of both.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next state in the energy hierarchy. Let's consider the possible transitions.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the problem is considering a pure rotational transition, a pure vibrational transition, or a combination. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but in the ground rotational state (J=0). So the next state could be J=1, which is a higher rotational state. Alternatively, the next state could be v=1.

But considering that the rotational energy levels are lower in energy than the vibrational ones (since B is small), the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is less than the energy difference between v=0 and v=1. So the photon required to cause a rotational transition would have a lower energy than one needed for a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So perhaps that's the ground state for both vibrations and rotations. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1). But which transition requires less energy?

Let me compute the energy differences.

First, calculate the vibrational energy difference. The energy between v=0 and v=1 is delta E_vib = E_vib(1) - E_vib(0) = [ (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) ] h w = (1) h w.

So delta E_vib = h w, where h is Planck's constant.

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and w is 4e14 rad/s. So delta E_vib = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot(J) = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant, which can be expressed as B = h/(8 pi² I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula is E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) J (J + 1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, let me think. The rotational energy levels in terms of the moment of inertia I are E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2 I), where J is the rotational quantum number.

But ħ is h/(2 pi), so ħ² = h²/(4 pi²). So E_rot = [ J (J+1) * (h²/(4 pi²)) ] / (2 I) ) = [ J (J+1) h² ] / (8 pi² I )

The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = [ (1*2) h²/(8 pi² I) ) ] - 0 = (2 h²)/(8 pi² I) ) = h²/(4 pi² I )

So delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )

I is the moment of inertia, which is for a diatomic molecule, I = mu R², where mu is the reduced mass.

So, mu is (m_x * m_y)/(m_x + m_y). The masses are given in amu, so I need to convert them to kg.

Wait, the mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So mu = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 20/11 is approximately 1.818. So mu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.023e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = mu * R² = 3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.023e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 2e-10 squared is 4e-20. So yeah, 3.023e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.209e-46 kg m².

Now, compute delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

So, delta E_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4 * pi² * 1.209e-46 )

Let me compute the denominator: 4 * (pi^2) ≈ 4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.478.

So denominator is 39.478 * 1.209e-46 ≈ 47.7e-46 = 4.77e-45.

So delta E_rot ≈ 4.39e-67 / 4.77e-45 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that's 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier, the vibrational energy delta E was 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition energy is much smaller than the vibrational.

But wait, that seems way off. Because I thought that the vibrational energy transitions are higher than rotational ones. So, the delta E for a rotational transition is much smaller than the vibrational. So, if the molecule is in the J=0 state, it can absorb a photon with energy equal to delta E_rot and transition to J=1. Alternatively, it could go from v=0 to v=1, which would require a much higher energy.

But what is the next state with the lowest possible energy? Since the next rotational state (J=1) requires less energy than the next vibrational state (v=1), the molecule would preferentially transition to J=1 before v=1. But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So the next possible state is the first excited state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But since J=1 requires less energy, that transition would occur if the photon's energy is sufficient for the J=1 transition. But if the photon's energy is enough for both, but the question is about the minimal possible photon energy, so the photon would cause the transition to the next state, which is the J=1 state.

Wait, but the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the next state in the ordering of energy levels. Since the rotational state J=1 is lower in energy than the vibrational state v=1, the next state would be J=1, because it's the lowest possible higher energy state.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

But wait, in some models, the energy levels are treated as a combination of rotation and vibration. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the energy difference between the (v=0, J=0) state and the next possible state, which could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Whichever requires the least energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model allows transitions that change both J and v. But in that case, the minimal energy transition would be J=0 to J=1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which would require the photon to have energy delta E_rot.

But wait, another thing to consider is that in the rotation-vibration coupling, the energy levels might be quantized in a way that combines both. However, for simplicity, perhaps the problem assumes that the next state is the first rotational state. Or maybe the problem is actually considering a vibration transition, but that's the next possible higher energy state. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the energy levels.

Let me compute both energy differences.

Vibrational delta E: 2.65e-19 J.

Rotational delta E: 9.2e-23 J.

So, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon that the molecule absorbs would need to have energy equal to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), then the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Between these two, which has lower energy? Let's compute the energy of each.

The energy of (v=0, J=1) is E_rot(1) + E_vib(0) = (B * 1 * 2) + ( (0 + 1/2) h w )

Wait, but for the non-rigid rotor model, the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib.

So, E_rot(J) = B J (J+1), and E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2) h w.

So, E(v=0, J=0) = 0 + (1/2) h w.

E(v=0, J=1) = B * 2 + (1/2) h w.

E(v=1, J=0) = 0 + (3/2) h w.

So, comparing E(v=0, J=1) and E(v=1, J=0):

E(v=0, J=1) = B * 2 + (1/2) h w.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) h w.

Which one is lower?

If (B *2 ) + (1/2) h w ) < (3/2) h w, then E(v=0, J=1) is lower.

So, 2 B < (3/2 h w - 1/2 h w) ) → 2 B < h w.

Is that true? Let's compute B and h w.

Earlier, I computed delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I) ) = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but B is the rotational constant, which is E_rot(J) = B J (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot is 2 B. Wait, but in the calculation above, delta E_rot is 2 B (since J goes from 0 to 1, the difference is 2 B).

So delta E_rot is 9.2e-23 J = 2 B → B = 4.6e-23 J.

Then, what is h w? h is 6.626e-34 J·s, w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So, 2 B = 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J.

So 2 B = 9.2e-23 J is much less than h w (2.65e-19 J). So indeed, E(v=0, J=1) = 2 B + (1/2 h w) ) = 9.2e-23 + (5.3e-19/2) → 9.2e-23 + 1.325e-19 J ≈ 1.325e-19 J.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) h w = 3.975e-19 J.

So E(v=0, J=1) is lower than E(v=1, J=0), meaning that the (v=0, J=1) state has lower energy than (v=1, J=0). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon energy of delta E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait another thing. The molecule is initially in (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the first excited state, which would have the next available energy level. If (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0), then yes, it's the next state. Therefore, the photon needs to supply 9.2e-23 J of energy.

But wait, the question is asking for the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, because the options are given in momentum units.

Wait, photons have energy E = p c, where p is momentum, and c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

So, if the energy is 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, that seems very small. None of the options are that small. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 N*s
B) 2.3e-27 N*s
C) 1.1e-27 N*s
D) 1.4e-28 N*s

Wait, N·s is the same as kg·m/s. So the photon's momentum would be in kg·m/s, which is the same as N·s.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the momentum is about 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s. None of the options are that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the transition.

Hmm, maybe I should go back and reevaluate. Perhaps the next state is not a rotational transition, but a vibrational one. Because if the problem is about the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), the next state might be (v=1, J=0). Maybe the question expects the vibrational transition.

Wait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational changes. But in the rigid rotor model, which this is similar to, the vibrational energy is considered separately.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transitions typically involve a change in v by ±1, while rotational transitions involve a change in J by ±1 or ±2. But the selection rules might affect which transitions are allowed.

But even if a rotational transition is allowed, the energy required is much less than a vibrational transition, so the photon needed for a rotational transition would have less energy.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so the next state with the lowest possible energy would require the minimal possible photon energy. So the minimal energy would be a rotational transition, which is smaller than a vibrational one.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which would give a momentum of 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s → 3e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are that low. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference again.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula for B. Let me clarify.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot(J) = (ħ² / (2 I)) J (J+1). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ²/(2 I)) (2) ) → (ħ² * 2) / (2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, correct, so delta E_rot = ( ħ² ) / I.

Wait, ħ is h/(2 pi). So ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

So delta E_rot = (h²/(4 pi²)) / I.

Ah, earlier I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but let's recompute the moment of inertia I.

I = mu R^2, where mu is the reduced mass.

Mass X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converting to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.022e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

So delta E_rot = (h^2) / (4 pi² I )

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 / (4 pi² * 1.209e-46 )

Compute denominator: 4 pi² ≈ 39.478.

39.478 * 1.209e-46 = approx 4.76e-45.

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.76e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So that's about 9.22e-23 J, which is correct.

So the momentum is p = E / c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But wait, the options are all much larger than that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the next state is a combination of both a rotational and vibrational transition. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational state, and just wants the photon to cause a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1.

In that case, the energy difference is delta E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 → 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum would be p = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is a bit lower. But wait, 8.8e-28 isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state (v=1, J=0), which is the first vibrational excited state. That would require delta E_vib = h w.

In that case, the momentum p would be 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is approximately 8.8e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28, but that's about a quarter of the value I calculated. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute delta E_vib.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So delta E_vib is h * w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, p = E / c → 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.834e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both a rotational and a vibrational change. Wait, but the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the least energy increase. So that would be the rotational transition, which requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the moment of inertia is calculated with the average bond length, but perhaps it's considering the bond's length in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, let me recalculate mu again.

mu = (m_x * m_y) / (m_x + m_y) )

m_x = 20 amu, m_y = 2 amu.

mu = (20 * 2) / (22) ) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed because the selection rules require a change in J of ±1, but for the molecule to transition from J=0 to J=1, which is allowed. So that's fine.

But why don't the options match the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rigid rotor model, which ignores the vibrational energy and focuses only on rotational transitions.

Wait, but the question says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So the energy includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to go from the (v=0, J=0) state to (v=0, J=1). The energy difference is delta E_rot = 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 N·s, but again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me double-check.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

mu is 20/11 amu = approx 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

mu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg → approx 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

So I = mu * R² → 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.02e-27 *4e-20 → 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for delta E_rot. Let me recheck.

E_rot(J) = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I )

So delta E between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = ( ħ² * 2 )/(2 I ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, ħ is h/(2 pi), so ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

So delta E_rot = (h²/(4 pi²)) / I → h^2/(4 pi² I )

Yes, that's correct.

h² is (6.626e-34)^2 → about 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 pi² I → 4 * (9.87) * 1.208e-46 → 4*9.87 ≈39.48 → 39.48 * 1.208e-46 ≈47.6e-46 → 4.76e-45.

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 /4.76e-45 → ~9.22e-23 J.

Hmm, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 and v=0 to v=0, and the momentum is calculated using the rotational energy, but the options are not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the transition to the next state with the next possible energy, which would be a vibrational transition, but in that case the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused energy and momentum somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the momentum of a photon is p = E_photon / c.

Wait, but E_photon = delta E, which is either 9.2e-23 J (rotational) or 2.65e-19 J (vibrational).

So for the rotational case: p =9.2e-23 /3e8 → 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

Vibrational case: 2.65e-19 /3e8 → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of the vibrational value. Option D is 1.4e-28, also lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps the energy is not delta E, but some multiple of that. For example, in vibrational transitions, sometimes the selection rules allow for changes in v by ±1, but perhaps if the molecule is in the ground state, it can't go beyond v=0. No, the ground state is v=0, so the first transition is to v=1.

Another possibility is that the model is considering the transition not from (v=0, J=0), but to the next state which is (v=0, J=1), but perhaps I have to include the vibrational energy as well.

Wait, no, in the (v=0, J=1) state, the energy is E_rot + E_vib. E_rot is 2B and E_vib is (1/2)hw.

So, the energy difference from (v=0, J=0) is 2B + (1/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )? No, that's not correct. The initial state is (v=0, J=0), which has E = E_rot(0) + E_vib(0) → 0 + (1/2)hw.

The final state is (v=0, J=1), which has E = E_rot(1) + E_vib(0) → 2B + (1/2)hw.

So the energy difference is (2B + ½ hw) - (½ hw) )= 2B.

So the delta E is 2B = 9.2e-23 J, same as before.

But why is the photon's momentum not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0). So the delta E is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

So the photon's energy would be h w, and the momentum p = h w / c = 6.626e-34 *4e14 / 3e8 → (2.65e-19 ) / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, which are lower than this. Hmm, but none match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational delta E. Let me recalculate delta E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy includes the vibrational effects, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the rotational constant B and then compute the energy.

The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I c ), but perhaps I should use a different formula.

Wait, another formula for B is:

B = (h)/(8 pi² I c )

Wait, no, I think that's for the rotational constants in spectroscopy, where the energy is expressed in terms of wavenumbers.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps the energy in joules is E_rot = h c B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^-1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try an alternative approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the photon's momentum that causes a transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which requires delta E = 2B.

But again, I don't see how that would match the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of the energy. Let's see:

If delta E = 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s, which are much bigger.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of I. Wait, R is in angstroms, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, correct. mu is 3.02e-27 kg, correct.

Wait, perhaps in the formula for delta E_rot, I should have used I in different units. Wait, no, I think that was correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me think again. B is the rotational constant defined as:

B = ħ²/(2 I )

So E_rot = B J (J+1 )

But delta E_rot from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

So B = ħ²/(2 I ) → delta E_rot = 2 * ( ħ²/(2 I )) )= ħ²/I.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, let me compute ħ.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s → ħ = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68 J² s².

So delta E_rot = ħ² / I = 1.113e-68 / 1.209e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J. Same result as before.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational transition, but that would give 8.8e-28 N·s, which is bigger than any of the options except option B and C.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A:1.9e-28

Option B:2.3e-27

Option C:1.1e-27

Option D:1.4e-28

Wait, 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires delta E = h w.

So p = h w / c.

h=6.626e-34 J·s, w=4e14 rad/s.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, this isn't matching any of the options exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state with the next possible energy, which would involve a change in both v and J. But that would require more energy, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the expression for the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the bond as variable, thereby changing the moment of inertia. But in that case, the calculation would be more complicated, involving both vibrational and rotational transitions. But I'm not sure how that would affect the energy required.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition to a higher vibrational state, but I don't see how that would be lower in energy than the rotational transition.

Another possibility: perhaps the mass given is in atomic mass units, but I forgot to convert them to kilograms correctly. Let me check.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mu = 20 * 2 / (20 + 2 ) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

So mu in kg is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor approximation, which would not include the vibrational energy. But the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the next state is (v=0, J=1). Maybe the next state is (v=1, J=0), which requires more energy, but perhaps that's the only allowed transition.

But that would make the required photon energy much higher, as we saw earlier.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum ~3e-31 N·s, and the vibrational transition requires ~8.8e-28 N·s. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 1.1e-27 N·s. That's about 1e-27, which is about 1e4 times larger than the vibrational case. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me re-calculate I.

mu is 3.02e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = mu * R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as the sum of the individual moments? No, that's not correct; the correct formula is I = mu R².

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit? But no, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. Or perhaps they're using the formula for the rotational energy as B J (J+1), where B is expressed in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the expression for B in terms of the vibrational parameters. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering the rotational transition, and the given options are based on that, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 9.2e-23 J is 9.2e-23 kg·m²/s². Momentum is kg·m/s.

So p = E/c → 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h/(8 pi² I c).

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula for B in terms of spectroscopic units (wavenumbers), but when I use this B, then E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

Wait, let me compute B as h/(8 pi² I c).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.209e-46 *3e8 )

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 78.96.

78.96 * 1.209e-46 = 9.55e-45.

9.55e-45 * 3e8 = 2.866e-36.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 2.866e-36 ≈ 2307 cm^-1.

But that's in spectroscopic terms. Then, the rotational energy in joules is E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

Wait, no, if B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1), then E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

h c is about 1.986e-25 J·cm.

So E_rot = 1.986e-25 J·cm * 2307 cm^-1 * J (J+1).

For J=1, E_rot = 1.986e-25 *2307 *2 →  approx 9.2e-22 J.

Which aligns with our previous calculation of delta E_rot being about 9.2e-23 J. Hmm, wait, wait. No, 2307 cm^-1 is for B, but when J=1,

E_rot = h c B (1)(2) = 1.986e-25 J·cm * 2307 cm^-1 *2 → 1.986e-25 * 2307 *2 = 9.2e-22 J.

Which is about 10 times larger than our previous delta E_rot value of 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but that's contradictory. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, because if B is in cm^-1, then the energy E_rot would be E = h c B J (J+1).

So for J=1, E_rot = 1.986e-25 * 2307 * 2 = 9.2e-22 J. But earlier, when I calculated delta E_rot as 9.2e-23 J, I think I confused B and E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula.

Wait, the rotational constant B is usually expressed in cm^-1, where B = h/(8 pi² I c ). So with I = 1.209e-46 kg·m².

Let me compute B again.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

8 pi² I c = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.209e-46 kg·m² * 3e8 m/s.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.209e-46 = 9.55e-45.

9.55e-45 *3e8 = 2.866e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.866e-36 ≈ 2307 cm^-1.

Then, E_rot for J=1 is E_rot = h c B J(J+1) → 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s * 2307 cm^-1 * 2.

Wait, but units: 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So E_rot = h c B J (J+1) → E_rot = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e10 cm/s) * (2307 cm^-1) * 2.

Wait, the cm in 3e10 cm/s and 2307 cm^-1 will cancel out.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 * 3e10 * 2307 * 2 → compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e10 = 1.9878e-23.

1.9878e-23 * 2307 = 4.58e-20.

4.58e-20 * 2 =9.16e-20 J.

So delta E_rot is approximately 9.16e-20 J.

Wait, that's a different value than before. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Hmm.

Now, the photon's energy would be 9.16e-20 J, and the momentum p = E/c → 9.16e-20 /3e8 =3.05e-28 kg·m/s → 3.05e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is a bit lower but in the same order of magnitude.

But I'm getting a bit confused here because different approaches give me different results. It seems I might have made a mistake in the earlier calculation, perhaps mixing up different units or formulas.

Another approach: perhaps the correct energy to consider is the vibrational energy, which would give a higher momentum. Let me compute that again.

Delta E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

None of the options match this, so perhaps the problem is expecting the rotational energy, and the correct option is D:1.4e-28 N·s, which is close to 1.4e-28.

But according to my most recent calculation, I get 3e-28 N·s. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try calculating B once more.

B = h/(8 pi² I c )

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

I=1.209e-46 kg·m².

c=3e8 m/s.

So 8 pi² I c =8 * (9.8696) * 1.209e-46 *3e8.

Compute 8 *9.8696 → about 78.9568.

78.9568 *1.209e-46 ≈9.55e-45.

9.55e-45 *3e8 →2.865e-36.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.865e-36 → approx 2307 cm^-1.

Now, E_rot for J=1 is E_rot = h c B J(J+1) → h=6.626e-34, c=3e8 m/s, B=2307 cm^-1.

But to compute E_rot, let's convert B into m^-1.

B in m^-1 is 2307 cm^-1 * (1 m / 100 cm) )= 23.07 m^-1.

So E_rot =6.626e-34 *3e8 *23.07 * 2 →6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *23.07 =4.58e-24.

4.58e-24 *2=9.16e-24 J.

So delta E_rot is 9.16e-24 J.

Then, p=9.16e-24 /3e8 =3.05e-32 kg·m/s →3.05e-32 N·s.

Hmm, that's even smaller than before. I'm getting inconsistent results, which suggests I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me compute the rotational energy difference using the formula E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1).

So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

So delta E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ² / I.

Compute ħ² = (h/(2 pi))² → (6.626e-34 /6.2832)^2 → approx (1.055e-34)^2 →1.113e-68 J² s².

I =1.209e-46 kg·m².

So delta E_rot =1.113e-68 / 1.209e-46 → approx 9.21e-23 J.

Then, p =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't include anything that small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of both the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would require even more energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration, and the next state is the first state with higher energy, which is a combination of both. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which requires a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J, but the options don't have that.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the momentum, which is p = E/c.

But perhaps the energy required is the vibrational energy, which is h w, and the momentum is (h w)/(c).

Which would be (6.626e-34 *4e14 ) /3e8 → (2.65e-19)/(3e8) →8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about 4.6 times smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the rigid rotor model and only considering rotation, and the answer is option D:1.4e-28 N·s.

Wait, 1.4e-28 is about 1.6e-28, which is roughly 0.16e-27, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using the rotational energy in J and calculate p.

But I'm really stuck here. None of the options match my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy, and I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute p again.

E =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 / 3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is the rotational transition, but the answer is not among the options, which suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational delta E. Let me compute it again.

Compute I = mu R².

mu =20*2/(20+2) amu =40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

mu =1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.022e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I =3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.022e-27 *4e-20 =1.209e-46 kg·m².

Compute delta E_rot = (h²)/(4 pi² I )

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

4 pi² I =4*(9.8696)*1.209e-46 ≈4*9.8696=39.478; 39.478 *1.209e-46=47.6e-46=4.76e-45.

So delta E_rot=4.39e-67 /4.76e-45≈9.22e-23 J.

p=9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

Hmm, no match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia with the sum of the masses instead of the reduced mass. Let me compute that.

I = m_x * m_y * R²/(m_x + m_y) → that's the same as mu * R², which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as (m_x + m_y) R², which would be incorrect. Let me see:

If I = (20 +2) amu * (2e-10 m )^2 → 22 amu →22 *1.66e-27 kg →3.65e-26 kg.

I =3.65e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2=3.65e-26 *4e-20=1.46e-45 kg·m².

Then delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )=4.39e-67/(4 pi² *1.46e-45 )=4.39e-67/(4*9.87*1.46e-45 )=4.39e-67/(5.87e-45 )=7.48e-23 J.

p=7.48e-23/3e8=2.49e-31 N·s. Still way below the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27 N·s, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated as p = sqrt(2mE), but that's for a classical treatment, which doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum from the kinetic energy.

Wait, photon's energy is E =pc, so p= E/c.

So, if the required energy is delta E_rot =9.2e-23 J, p=3.07e-31 N·s.

Alternatively, for delta E_vib=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't match either.

Wait, looking at option C:1.1e-27 N·s.

Hmm, 1.1e-27 is about 1e-27, which is 1e20 times larger than 1e-31. So perhaps the problem is considering a transition that I'm not accounting for.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next possible state, which includes both a rotational and vibrational change. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which requires delta E = h w.

p= h w /c =6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8=2.65e-19/3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next state in terms of rotational energy, which is (v=0, J=1), so delta E_rot=9.2e-23 J, p=3e-31 N·s.

But without any option matching, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as I = (m_x + m_y) R².

Let me compute that.

m_x + m_y =20 +2=22 amu=22 *1.66e-27 kg=3.65e-26 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I=3.65e-26 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.65e-26 *4e-20=1.46e-45 kg·m².

Then, delta E_rot = (h²)/(4 pi² I )=4.39e-67/(4 pi² *1.46e-45 )=4.39e-67/(5.87e-45 )=7.48e-23 J.

p=7.48e-23/3e8=2.49e-31 N·s.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as I = m_x m_y R²/(m_x + m_y ), which is correct.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

I think I'm stuck and might have to make an educated guess. Considering that the rotational transition requires less energy, and perhaps the problem expects that, but the options don't have that value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Among the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of the vibrational p I calculated. So maybe there's an error in the problem statement or the options.

But without further information, I'll have to make a choice. Since the vibrational transition requires higher energy and the rotational requires lower, and the question asks for the minimal possible energy, the rotational transition is the correct one. However, none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vibrational energy calculation. Let me check.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, none match this exactly, but perhaps I should choose the closest option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B:2.3e-27 N·s. That's about 2.6e-27, which is much larger than our calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute p = (hbar w)/(c), since sometimes in quantum mechanics, they use ħ instead of h.

E = ħ w = (h/(2 pi)) * w.

So E = (6.626e-34 /6.283) *4e14 → approx (1.055e-34) *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p=4.22e-20 /3e8=1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is close to option D:1.4e-28 N·s.

Ah! That's option D.

Wait, so perhaps I should have used ħ instead of h. Let me see.

Yes, because in quantum mechanics, the energy for a photon is often written as E = ħ ω, where ω is the angular frequency.

Yes! So the correct calculation is E_photon = ħ w.

So E_photon = (h/(2 pi)) * w.

Then, p = E_photon / c = (h/(2 pi c)) * w.

So let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 / (2 *3.1416 )) *4e14 → (6.626e-34 /6.2832 ) *4e14 → approx (1.055e-34 ) *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p=4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D:1.4e-28 N·s.

Ah, that's the correct approach! I should have used ħ instead of h in the photon energy calculation.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \(v=0\) and the lowest rotational state \(J=0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a rotational transition (\(v=0, J=1\)) or a vibrational transition (\(v=1, J=0\)). The energy required for these transitions is calculated, and the photon's momentum is derived from the energy difference.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (\(\mu\)):**
   The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y}
   \]
   Substituting \(m_X = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), and \(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (\(I\)):**
   The moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule is given by:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2
   \]
   Substituting \(\mu = 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) and \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   I = 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.209 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)):**
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}}(J) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1),
   \]
   where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\). The energy difference between \(J=0\) and \(J=1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(1) - E_{\text{rot}}(0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(I = 1.209 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.209 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}}(v) = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega,
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\). The energy difference between \(v=0\) and \(v=1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum:**
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c},
   \]
   where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]
   For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the calculated values match the provided options. The closest match to the vibrational transition is **Option D: \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)**, which aligns with the use of \(\hbar\) instead of \(h\) in the energy calculation. Thus, the correct answer is:
