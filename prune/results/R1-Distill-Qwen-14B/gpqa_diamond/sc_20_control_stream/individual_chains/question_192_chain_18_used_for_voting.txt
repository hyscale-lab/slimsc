Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is somewhere inside the conductor but not at the center.

Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember from my studies that when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when we add the +q, what happens?

Conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have charges on the surfaces. Since the conductor was neutral, adding a positive charge inside the cavity would induce negative charges on the inner surface of the conductor, right? Because the positive charge attracts the electrons. Then, since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a positive charge equal to +q. Or wait, no, because the conductor was initially uncharged. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so it has no net charge. When we add +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q (induced by the +q), so the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the total charge on the conductor's outer surface is +q.

Now, about the electric field outside the conductor. I remember that the electric field outside a charged spherical conductor is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point outside, the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface we choose.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor has a cavity with a charge and an induced charge. But the conductor itself (the material) is neutral. So the net charge on the conductor is zero. Wait no, wait. The conductor was uncharged, and when we add +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must be +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

Wait, but the conductor was initially uncharged. So, the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q. So when we're outside the conductor, the field is due to the +q on the outer surface.

Wait, but point P is outside, so the field E at P should be the same as if the charge were at the center, right? Because for a spherical conductor, the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the conductor's outer surface has charge +q, so the field outside depends only on that.

But wait, the options don't all have L². Looking at the options:

Option B is (1/4πε₀) * q / L². Option D is similar but with l². So which one is correct?

Wait, but the configuration is more complicated because the cavity is not at the center. The charge is inside the cavity, which is situated at a distance s from the center, and the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, with angle theta between l and s.

Wait, so the conductor's outer surface has +q, but the charge distribution is uniform because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. So the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric around the center of the conductor. Therefore, when calculating the electric field at a point outside, you can treat the entire charge as being at the center of the conductor. So the distance from the point P to the center is L, so the field should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor and +q on the outer. So when we look at the field outside, it's just due to the +q on the outer surface. So the field is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the cavity is, the field outside only depends on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.

But wait, the setup is that the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the conductor's center. So the field inside the conductor would be different, but outside it's symmetric.

So for P outside, the distance from the conductor's center is L, so the field is due to the +q at the center, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B matches that.

Alternatively, is there any reason why the position of the cavity would affect the external field? No, because the conductor's charges rearrange to maintain the external field as if all the charge were at the center.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup and Induction**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor due to electrostatic induction. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the induced charge.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a net charge of $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Symmetry**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, which is outside the conductor. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field at $P$ is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center. The position of the cavity inside the conductor and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the external field because the conductor's charges redistribute to ensure uniformity in the external field.

4. **Final Expression**: The electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This matches option **B**.

Thus, the correct answer is:
