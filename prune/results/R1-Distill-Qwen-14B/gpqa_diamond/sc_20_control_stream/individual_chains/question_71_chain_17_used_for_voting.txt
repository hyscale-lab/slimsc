Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. There are five planets in a system, and they're in orbital resonance with their orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The method used to discover them is the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for the temperature part. Anyway, the key point is that the planets are in resonance and have these orbital period ratios.

The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, which I remember is the measure of how much light that hits a planet is reflected. Since albedo is the same for both, it won't affect the calculation.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital radius, R_star is the star's radius, and T_star is the star's effective temperature. But wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the inverse square law for radiation. Another way: the flux received is proportional to L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity. Since the star's luminosity L is related to its radius and temperature (L = 4πR²σT⁴, with σ being the Stefan-Boltzmann constant), maybe I can combine these.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is often written as Te = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here because the star is the same for all planets, so R and T_star would cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but in this problem, are we assuming that all the planets are orbiting the same star? I think yes, because the problem doesn't mention anything else. So the star's properties (like L or R) would be the same for all.

So the formula for equilibrium temperature, without albedo, is:

Te = T_star * ( (L/(16πσ)) / (4πa²) )^(1/4)

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. The simpler formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature scales with the inverse square root of the orbital distance. More precisely, Te is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). Since L and σ are constants for the star, for two planets, the ratio of their temperatures would be sqrt( sqrt(a2/a1) ) or something like that.

Wait, let's think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = ( (L * (1 - abedo) )/(16πσ a²) )^(1/4)

Because the planet absorbs (1 - albedo) times the incident flux. But since the albedo is the same for both planets (given in the problem), we can factor that out when taking the ratio.

So for Planet 4 and Planet 2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be:

Te4 / Te2 = sqrt( sqrt( (a2 / a4) ) )

Wait, let me get the formula right. Let me derive it.

Flux from the star at distance a is F = L/(4πa²).

The planet absorbs this flux, but only (1 - A) where A is the albedo. The power absorbed is F * π r² (r is planet radius) * (1 - A).

The planet radiates as a blackbody, so the power is 4π r² σ Te^4.

Setting them equal:

F * π r² (1 - A) = 4π r² σ Te^4

Simplify:

F (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

F is L/(4π a²), so:

(L/(4π a²)) (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

Multiply both sides by 4π a²:

L (1 - A) = 4π a² *4 σ Te^4

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me do this more carefully.

Wait, the equation is:

(L/(4π a²)) * (1 - A) * π r² = 4 π r² σ Te^4

Simplify:

(L (1 - A) π r² ) / (4 π a²) ) = 4 π r² σ Te^4

Cancel π r² on both sides:

L (1 - A) / (4 a²) ) = 4 σ Te^4

Multiply both sides by 4 a²:

L (1 - A) = 16 π a² σ Te^4

So,

Te^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² )

Take the fourth root:

Te = [ L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4 )

So, for two planets, Te4/Te2 would be:

[ (a2^2 / a4^2) ]^(1/4 ) * [ (L (1-A)) / (16 π σ) ]^(1/4) / [ (L (1-A)) / (16 π σ) ]^(1/4) )

Wait, no, because [ L (1-A) ] and [16 π σ] are the same for both, so when you take the ratio, they cancel.

So:

Te4/Te2 = [ (1/a4²) / (1/a2²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which simplifies to:

Te4/Te2 = ( a2² / a4² )^(1/4 ) = (a2/a4)^(1/2 )

So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Wait, so the temperature ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Alternatively, since a is the orbital radius, we can say that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( (a2) / (a4) )

But wait, the periods are given, not the radii. So I need to relate the periods to the radii.

Since the planets are in circular orbits and presumably orbit the same star, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the radius for circular orbits).

So P² ∝ a³, or a = (P²)^(1/3) * constant.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So a2 = k * P2^(2/3)

a4 = k * P4^(2/3)

So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3 )

Wait, because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3), same for a4.

So the ratio a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3 )

Putting that back into the temperature ratio:

Te4/Te2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) is x^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure.

sqrt( x^(2/3) ) = x^( (2/3) * (1/2) ) = x^(1/3).

Yes, correct. So the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

So Te4/Te2 = ( P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

Now, let's get the values of P2 and P4.

The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2=2*P1, Planet_3 has P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 has P4=3.5*P1, and Planet_5 has P5=5*P1.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5. Let's compute that.

2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2 / (7/2) ) = 2 * 2/7 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So P2/P4 ≈ 0.5714.

Now, take the cube root of this ratio.

Cube root of (4/7) or approximately cube root of 0.5714.

Hmm, what's the approximate value of cube root of 0.57?

I know that cube of 0.8 is 0.512, because 0.8^3 = 0.512.

Cube of 0.82 is approximately (0.82)^3 = 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, then *0.82: 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ 0.551.

Wait, 0.82^3 is about 0.551? Hmm, let me compute 0.82 * 0.82:

0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724.

Then 0.6724 * 0.82:

0.6724 * 0.8 = 0.53792,

0.6724 * 0.02 = 0.013448.

Sum is about 0.551368.

So cube of 0.82 is approximately 0.5514.

But our value is 0.5714, which is a bit higher.

So let's think about the cube root of 0.57.

Let me try 0.82^3= ~0.551, as above.

0.83^3: 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889. Then 0.6889 * 0.83.

Compute 0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, 0.6889 * 0.03=0.020667.

Sum: 0.55112 + 0.020667 = 0.571787.

Ah, that's about 0.5718, which is very close to 0.5714.

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5718, which is almost exactly the value we have for P2/P4.

So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Therefore, the ratio Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the formula again. Because I might have mixed up the ratio.

Wait, Te4 is the temperature of planet 4, and Te2 is planet 2. So the ratio Te4/Te2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3 ). Wait, no, from earlier, the ratio Te4/Te2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, no, wait.

Wait, let me recheck. The formula we derived was (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Because Te4/Te2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So (2/3.5) = 4/7 ≈0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So Te4/Te2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option C is 0.83, option D is 0.75.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when a planet is farther away, the temperature is lower. So Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, right?

Wait, no. Let's check. Because the period is longer for larger a. So since P4 is longer than P2, a4 is larger than a2.

So Planet_4 is farther away than Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_4's equilibrium temperature should be lower than Planet_2's. So Te4 < Te2.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is less than 1.

In our calculation, it came out to about 0.83, which is about 83% of Planet_2's temperature. So that makes sense.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps.

1. The equilibrium temperature formula: Te ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), because Te is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) → a^(-1/2).

So Te is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.

2. Using Kepler's third law: a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3)

3. So a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3).

4. So a2 / a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

5. Temperature ratio: Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2 ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Yes, that's correct.

So computing (2/3.5) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. Cube root of that is about 0.83.

So the ratio is 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the orbital radius. Using Kepler's third law, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the temperature ratio \( \frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}
\]

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, the periods are \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \( \frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Since Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, its equilibrium temperature is lower, consistent with the result.

The correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Wait, but in this problem, are we assuming that all the planets are orbiting the same star? I think yes, because the problem doesn't mention anything else. So the star's properties (like L or R) would be the same for all.

So the formula for equilibrium temperature, without albedo, is:

Te = T_star * ( (L/(16πσ)) / (4πa²) )^(1/4)

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. The simpler formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature scales with the inverse square root of the orbital distance. More precisely, Te is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). Since L and σ are constants for the star, for two planets, the ratio of their temperatures would be sqrt( sqrt(a2/a1) ) or something like that.

Wait, let's think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = ( (L * (1 - abedo) )/(16πσ a²) )^(1/4)

Because the planet absorbs (1 - albedo) times the incident flux. But since the albedo is the same for both planets (given in the problem), we can factor that out when taking the ratio.

So for Planet 4 and Planet 2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be:

Te4 / Te2 = sqrt( sqrt( (a2 / a4) ) )

Wait, let me get the formula right. Let me derive it.

Flux from the star at distance a is F = L/(4πa²).

The planet absorbs this flux, but only (1 - A) where A is the albedo. The power absorbed is F * π r² (r is planet radius) * (1 - A).

The planet radiates as a blackbody, so the power is 4π r² σ Te^4.

Setting them equal:

F * π r² (1 - A) = 4π r² σ Te^4

Simplify:

F (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

F is L/(4π a²), so:

(L/(4π a²)) (1 - A) = 4 σ Te^4

Multiply both sides by 4π a²:

L (1 - A) = 4π a² *4 σ Te^4

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me do this more carefully.

Wait, the equation is:

(L/(4π a²)) * (1 - A) * π r² = 4 π r² σ Te^4

Simplify:

(L (1 - A) π r² ) / (4 π a²) ) = 4 π r² σ Te^4

Cancel π r² on both sides:

L (1 - A) / (4 a²) ) = 4 σ Te^4

Multiply both sides by 4 a²:

L (1 - A) = 16 π a² σ Te^4

So,

Te^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² )

Take the fourth root:

Te = [ L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4 )

So, for two planets, Te4/Te2 would be:

[ (a2^2 / a4^2) ]^(1/4 ) * [ (L (1-A)) / (16 π σ) ]^(1/4) / [ (L (1-A)) / (16 π σ) ]^(1/4) )

Wait, no, because [ L (1-A) ] and [16 π σ] are the same for both, so when you take the ratio, they cancel.

So:

Te4/Te2 = [ (1/a4²) / (1/a2²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which simplifies to:

Te4/Te2 = ( a2² / a4² )^(1/4 ) = (a2/a4)^(1/2 )

So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Wait, so the temperature ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Alternatively, since a is the orbital radius, we can say that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( (a2) / (a4) )

But wait, the periods are given, not the radii. So I need to relate the periods to the radii.

Since the planets are in circular orbits and presumably orbit the same star, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the radius for circular orbits).

So P² ∝ a³, or a = (P²)^(1/3) * constant.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So a2 = k * P2^(2/3)

a4 = k * P4^(2/3)

So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3 )

Wait, because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3), same for a4.

So the ratio a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3 )

Putting that back into the temperature ratio:

Te4/Te2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) is x^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure.

sqrt( x^(2/3) ) = x^( (2/3) * (1/2) ) = x^(1/3).

Yes, correct. So the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

So Te4/Te2 = ( P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

Now, let's get the values of P2 and P4.

The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2=2*P1, Planet_3 has P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 has P4=3.5*P1, and Planet_5 has P5=5*P1.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5. Let's compute that.

2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2 / (7/2) ) = 2 * 2/7 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So P2/P4 ≈ 0.5714.

Now, take the cube root of this ratio.

Cube root of (4/7) or approximately cube root of 0.5714.

Hmm, what's the approximate value of cube root of 0.57?

I know that cube of 0.8 is 0.512, because 0.8^3 = 0.512.

Cube of 0.82 is approximately (0.82)^3 = 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, then *0.82: 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ 0.551.

Wait, 0.82^3 is about 0.551? Hmm, let me compute 0.82 * 0.82:

0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724.

Then 0.6724 * 0.82:

0.6724 * 0.8 = 0.53792,

0.6724 * 0.02 = 0.013448.

Sum is about 0.551368.

So cube of 0.82 is approximately 0.5514.

But our value is 0.5714, which is a bit higher.

So let's think about the cube root of 0.57.

Let me try 0.82^3= ~0.551, as above.

0.83^3: 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889. Then 0.6889 * 0.83.

Compute 0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, 0.6889 * 0.03=0.020667.

Sum: 0.55112 + 0.020667 = 0.571787.

Ah, that's about 0.5718, which is very close to 0.5714.

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.5718, which is almost exactly the value we have for P2/P4.

So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Therefore, the ratio Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the formula again. Because I might have mixed up the ratio.

Wait, Te4 is the temperature of planet 4, and Te2 is planet 2. So the ratio Te4/Te2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3 ). Wait, no, from earlier, the ratio Te4/Te2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, no, wait.

Wait, let me recheck. The formula we derived was (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Because Te4/Te2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So (2/3.5) = 4/7 ≈0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So Te4/Te2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option C is 0.83, option D is 0.75.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when a planet is farther away, the temperature is lower. So Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, right?

Wait, no. Let's check. Because the period is longer for larger a. So since P4 is longer than P2, a4 is larger than a2.

So Planet_4 is farther away than Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_4's equilibrium temperature should be lower than Planet_2's. So Te4 < Te2.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is less than 1.

In our calculation, it came out to about 0.83, which is about 83% of Planet_2's temperature. So that makes sense.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps.

1. The equilibrium temperature formula: Te ∝ (1/a)^(1/2), because Te is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) → a^(-1/2).

So Te is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.

2. Using Kepler's third law: a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3)

3. So a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3).

4. So a2 / a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

5. Temperature ratio: Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2 ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3 )

Yes, that's correct.

So computing (2/3.5) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. Cube root of that is about 0.83.

So the ratio is 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the orbital radius. Using Kepler's third law, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the temperature ratio \( \frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}
\]

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, the periods are \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \( \frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Since Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, its equilibrium temperature is lower, consistent with the result.

The correct answer is:
