Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Then, when X is treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes some reaction to form Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two different liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. 

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they each give a single substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated, maybe an alkane or something without double bonds.

The question is about the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A) 16, B) 18, C) 22, D) 12.

Hmm. Let me think about each part step by step.

First, mixture X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. What liquids make bromine water decolorize? Well, that's typically things with unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes. Because bromine adds across double bonds, causing the solution to decolorize.

So X must have two components, each of which is an alkene or alkyne. Since they're liquids, maybe they are smaller alkenes or perhaps cyclic structures.

Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. The reaction is a disproportionation reaction, meaning one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but since X is a mixture of two liquids, maybe each undergoes some kind of reaction. Hmm, perhaps each component in X is a diene or something that can undergo some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo some addition or other reaction when heated with Pt.

Wait, the product Y is from a disproportionation, which suggests that each component in X might be a single substance that undergoes a disproportionation. But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a different reaction, but in a way that their products form Y as a mixture of two other liquids. But the problem says Y is from the disproportionation of X. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question says that when X is treated with Pt when heated, it undergoes a disproportionation and forms Y. So perhaps X is a single compound, but wait no, X is a mixture of two. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing. Maybe each component of X is a different compound that, when treated with Pt, undergoes a different reaction, but the overall result is Y being a mixture of two new compounds. Maybe each component of X is an alkene that undergoes hydrogenation, but that might not be a disproportionation.

Wait, let's think again. Disproportionation is when a single species both loses and gains electrons. So for example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, each O atom is both oxidized and reduced. But in this case, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of these two liquids undergoes a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, and each of them undergoes a reaction that causes a change in their structure, leading to Y's components.

Wait, maybe each of the components in X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon heating with Pt, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, perhaps each undergoes hydrogenation, but in a way that leads to two different products. But then, in that case, perhaps the alkenes are of different structures, leading to different alkanes in Y.

Wait, but the problem states that Y's mixture doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests Y's components are saturated, i.e., alkanes, because alkanes don't have double bonds to react with bromine.

So, X's components are unsaturated (they can decolorize bromine), Y's are saturated (so no decolorization). So X's components are alkenes or alkynes, and Y's are alkanes.

So, maybe each component in X is an alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes an alkane. But wait, hydrogenation of alkenes would produce alkanes, but if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each would hydrogenate to a different alkane, making Y a mixture of these two alkanes.

But then, what kind of reaction would that be? Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen, but that's just addition, not a disproportionation. Oh, wait, the problem says that Y is formed as a result of a disproportionation. Hmm. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the components in X each are undergoing some kind of structural change, not just hydrogenation. Maybe each component is something like an alkene that undergoes a rearrangement, such as a cyclopropane opening or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the components in X are dienes or something else that could lead to different products upon hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps each of X's components undergoes a different reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, moving on to the next part: when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they each give only one substance Z. So, hydrogenating X gives Z, and hydrogenating Y also gives Z. Since X is a mixture, perhaps each component in X, when hydrogenated, gives Z. Similarly, each component in Y, when hydrogenated, gives Z. But wait, Y is a mixture of two alkanes, which are already saturated. So if you hydrogenate them, they wouldn't react further because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions. Unless under severe conditions, like high pressure or high temperature, perhaps some isomerization happens? But the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So maybe Z is an alkane, and that's all there is to it.

Wait, but if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, then hydrogenating them might not produce anything, or perhaps they are already alkanes. So maybe that's a clue. Because if Y is two alkanes, then hydrogenation of Y would give the same alkanes, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So perhaps when you hydrogenate X, each component in X (the alkenes) becomes Z, and when you hydrogenate Y (which is a mixture of alkanes and maybe another substance?), but wait, Y is formed from X via a reaction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should focus on the data given about substance Z.

Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let me calculate its molecular formula. The hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So 14.28% is roughly 14.28/100 = 0.1428. Let's compute the molecular formula.

Assuming Z is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me try to find integers n and m that satisfy this. Let's rearrange:

m / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = (12n + m)/7.

Multiply both sides by 7:

7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.

So, m is twice n. So the formula is CnH2n. So that's an alkene? Wait, but Z is formed by hydrogenation of both X and Y. Wait, but wait, if X's components are alkenes, then hydrogenating X would add H2 across the double bonds, converting them into alkanes. But the problem says that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of H being 14.28%, which we found to be CnH2n. That would be an alkene, but that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation would make it into an alkane.

Wait, unless I made a mistake. Let me recheck. If Z is a hydrocarbon resulting from hydrogenation, it must be an alkane. Because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, converting alkenes to alkanes. So Z must be an alkane, which would have the formula CnH2n+2. But according to the mass fraction, H is 14.28%, which is 1/7.

So, let's compute again. Let's assume Z is an alkane, so the formula is CnH2n+2.

Mass fraction of H is (2n+2)*1 / [12n + (2n+2)] = (2n+2)/(14n + 2).

We can set this equal to 0.1428 (approx 1/7).

So:

(2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying:

7*(2n +2) = 14n + 2.

14n + 14 = 14n + 2.

Subtract 14n from both sides:

14 = 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So that indicates a problem. So perhaps my assumption that Z is an alkane is wrong, even though it's the product of hydrogenation. Hmm, maybe Z isn't an alkane, but another type of hydrocarbon.

Wait, but the problem says that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which suggests that it's saturated, so alkane. But the calculation leads to a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So:

H% = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So,

7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene, not an alkane. Hmm, but then if Z is an alkene, how could it be the product of hydrogenation? Because hydrogenation would add H2 to alkenes to make alkanes. So this is a contradiction. So maybe I made an error in my approach.

Wait, maybe Z isn't from the hydrogenation of Y's components. Wait, the problem says, "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance Z". That suggests that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. And when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives Z. So if X's components are alkenes, hydrogenating them would give alkanes, which would be Z. But Z's H% suggests an alkene. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait another angle: perhaps X's components are alkenes, and when they're hydrogenated, they become alkanes, but then Z is an alkane. The H% would then have to fit an alkane. Let me recalculate with the alkane formula.

Assume Z is CnH2n+2. H% is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n + 2) = 14.28%.

Set this equal to 1/7:

(2n+2)/(14n + 2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n + 2 = (14n +2)/7 → 7*(2n + 2) = 14n + 2 → 14n +14 =14n +2 → 14=2. That's impossible, so that approach is wrong.

Hmm. So perhaps Z is a cycloalkane or something else. Or maybe the hydrogenation isn't adding H2 but doing something else. Alternatively, perhaps Z is a different kind of compound. Wait, maybe Z is a benzene ring with all the H's, but if so, that would be a cyclohexane, which is an alkane.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Z is toluene? No, because toluene isn't an alkane. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a smaller molecule. Let's try n=1. Then m=2 (from m=2n). So Z would be CH2, which is impossible. n=2: m=4 → C2H4, which is ethylene. H% is (4)/(24+4) =4/28 ≈14.28%. Oh! That's exactly the given value.

So Z is C2H4 (ethylene), but wait, that's an alkene. But how could hydrogenation lead to it? Because ethylene is an alkene, which would normally be hydrogenated to ethane (alkane). But the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So ethylene would react with hydrogen, adding two H's to become ethane. But if Z is ethylene, that's an alkene, and according to the problem, it doesn't react further with hydrogen. That can't be right because ethylene would react with H2 under hydrogenation conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting something wrong. Let me check the calculation again. If n=2, m=4. So molecular formula is C2H4. The molar mass is 28 g/mol. H mass is 4 g. So 4/28 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Yes, that's correct. So Z is C2H4, which is ethylene.

But wait, ethylene is an alkene. So if you hydrogenate ethylene, you get ethane. But the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So Y's components would have to hydrogenate to ethylene. But ethylene is an alkene, which doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of alkanes would not change anything. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Let me rethink. Maybe Z has a lower molecular weight. Let's try n=1: m=2 → C H2 is not a stable molecule. So that's impossible.

n=3: m=6 → C3H6. H% is 6/(36+6)=6/42=14.28%. So that works. So Z could be C3H6. But C3H6 can be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but if Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation, then perhaps it's propene. But then, hydrogenation of propene would give propane, an alkane. But according to the problem, hydrogenation gives Z. So if Z is propene, that's an alkene, which would require that the starting material was something else that upon hydrogenation gives propene. That seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. Then, if X's components are something that, upon hydrogenation, become cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is an alkane, so maybe the hydrogenation of a diene? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y giving Z. So, X is a mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize bromine). When X is hydrogenated, each alkene becomes an alkane. But the problem states that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, hydrogenating X gives Z, and hydrogenating Y gives Z.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes, their hydrogenation would give two alkanes, unless both alkenes hydrogenate to the same alkane Z. That would mean that the two components in X are alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane. So, for example, if X is a mixture of 1-butene and 2-butene, hydrogenation would give butane.

So, perhaps X has two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give the same alkane Z. Similarly, Y is a mixture of two alkanes. But wait, Y is a mixture of two liquids, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z. But wait, if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, they wouldn't hydrogenate further under normal conditions. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are alkyne and something else. Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they can't have triple bonds either. So Y's components must be alkanes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X's components are di-substituted alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give the same alkane. For example, if X has 1-butene and 2-butene, hydrogenating both would give butane. So Z would be butane (C4H10), which is an alkane.

Then, let's check the H% for butane. Butane is C4H10. The molar mass is 58 g/mol. H mass is 10 g. 10/58 ≈ 0.1724 or 17.24%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that doesn't match.

Wait, let's compute for another alkane. Let's see, for ethane (C2H6): H% is 6/(24+6) =6/30=0.2 → 20%. No, that's higher than 14.28%.

For propane (C3H8): H% is 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%. Still higher.

For pentane (C5H12): 12/(60+12)=12/72=16.66%. Closer, but still not 14.28%.

Wait, what about cyclopropane (C3H6)? Its molecular formula is C3H6, which is 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens. The molar mass is 42 g/mol. H% is 6/42=14.28%, which matches.

So Z is cyclopropane, which is an alkane, and its H% is 14.28%. That fits.

So if Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), then what is X? X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclopropane. Wait, but adding H2 to an alkene would only add two hydrogens. For example, if X's components are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, cyclopropane is a ring structure, so perhaps X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps X's components are alkenes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclopropane rings with double bonds elsewhere, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the components in X are more complex structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of X. X is a mixture of two alkenes. Each, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, cyclopropane has a ring of three carbons. So, perhaps each component in X is a cyclopropane with a substituent that is a double bond. Wait, but that's not possible because cyclopropane itself is a saturated ring. Alternatively, perhaps X's components are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, that seems odd. Let's think about cyclopropane as the product. How would that happen? Maybe the alkenes are strained or part of a ring. Hmm, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes are in a position that, when hydrogenated, forms a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are not simple alkenes but something else, like allenes (cumulative dienes) or conjugated dienes. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: since X's components are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclopropane. So, when an alkene reacts with H2 in the presence of a catalyst, it adds H2 across the double bond to form an alkane. So, to form cyclopropane, the starting alkene must have been cyclopropane with a double bond. Wait, but cyclopropane itself doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a larger ring that, upon hydrogenation, becomes a smaller ring. For instance, if X's components are cyclobutene (a 4-membered ring with a double bond), hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, converting it into cyclobutane. But cyclobutane isn't cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are substituted in a way that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. For example, if X has a molecule where a hydrogen is added across a double bond to form a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogen is added, it forms a bridge, leading to a cyclopropane. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes are strained, like norbornene or something else. But I'm not very confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are propenes with substituents, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with an exocyclic double bond. For example, 1-cyclopropene or something similar. But I'm not sure if that's a real compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but allenes (cumulative dienes). If each component is a di-alkene, their hydrogenation would add H2 in such a way as to form cyclopropane. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says that no conjugated multiple bonds are present in the molecules of X's components. So, each component in X is a non-conjugated diene or a single alkene without any conjugation. So perhaps each is a single, isolated double bond.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with a single, isolated double bond (no conjugation). When treated with Pt and heat, undergoes a reaction leading to Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes. Also, the reaction is a disproportionation, which suggests that perhaps each component in X is undergoing a different kind of reaction.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, and each is hydrogenated to form a different alkane, then Y would be a mixture of two alkanes. But the problem says Y is a mixture of two liquids, and each component in Y is the product of a disproportionation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the reaction when X is treated with Pt is not hydrogenation but something else. Since it's a disproportionation, perhaps each molecule in X is a single species that can be oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe each component of X is undergoing a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo a rearrangement when heated. For example, maybe each component is a cyclic diene that rearranges upon heating. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the components in X are undergoing dehydrohalogenation or some elimination, but that doesn't fit with the problem description.

Wait, another thought: since Y is formed via a disproportionation of X, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should instead focus on the fact that Z is cyclopropane, as that seems to fit the H% data. So, if Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), and it's the product of hydrogenation from X and Y, then let's think about what X and Y would be.

Hydrogenation of X gives Z. So X must be a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, each become cyclopropane. But that's not possible because alkenes upon hydrogenation become alkanes. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying Z.

Wait, let me try another approach. If Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H, and it's an alkane, let's try to find another possibility. Let's assume Z is C3H8 (propane). H% is 8/ (36+8) =8/44=18.18%, which is higher than 14.28%. So no.

Wait, maybe Z is a different kind of hydrocarbon, like a cycloalkane with a higher molecular weight. Let's try C4H8. Wait, 8/(48 +8)=8/56=14.28% exactly. So Z could be cyclobutane, which is C4H8. But wait, cyclobutane is an alkane, and its H% is 8/56=14.28%. That fits.

So Z is cyclobutane (C4H8). Now, when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclobutane. So X's components must be alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, become cyclobutane. So, for example, if X's components are 1,3-butadiene? No, wait, 1,3-butadiene is a diene, but adding H2 would give butane, not cyclobutane. Alternatively, if X's components are cyclobutene, which upon hydrogenation would become cyclobutane.

Ah, that makes sense. Cyclobutene (C4H6) is a cyclic alkene. Adding H2 across the double bond would yield cyclobutane (C4H8). So if X is a mixture of cyclobutene and another cyclic alkene, say cyclobutene and another compound that also hydrogenates to cyclobutane. Wait, but cyclobutene is a single compound, so perhaps X is a mixture of two different cyclic alkenes that each hydrogenate to cyclobutane. For example, cyclobutene and another structure.

Wait, but cyclobutene is C4H6. But if X is a mixture of cyclobutene and another cyclic alkene that also, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclobutane, then for each component, the addition of H2 across the double bond would produce cyclobutane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes that each, when hydrogenated, produce cyclobutane, then that's possible. For example, maybe X contains a mixture of cyclobutene and another cyclic alkene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X contains cyclopentene and something else that hydrogenates to cyclobutane. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes that each hydrogenate to cyclobutane. For example, 1,2-dichloroethene and something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids formed from X via a disproportionation. So perhaps X's components each undergo a disproportionation reaction when heated with Pt, leading to Y's components. So, for example, each component in X is a molecule that can both lose and gain electrons (disproportionation).

Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the problem again.

The problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids (alkenes or alkynes) that decolorize bromine water. Y is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine (alkanes or possibly other saturated compounds). When X is heated with Pt, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.

So perhaps each component of X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon heating, undergoes a rearrangement via a metal catalyst. For example, maybe each component undergoes a hydrogen shift or ring formation.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the components in X are allylic alkanes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps they are cumulenes or allenes, which can undergo some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is an alkyne. Because alkyne decolorizes bromine water as well. But the problem says that X's components have no conjugated multiple bonds, which would include triple bonds as well. Wait, no, triple bonds are considered conjugated if they are part of a conjugated system. Wait, but the problem says, "no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X." So perhaps each component in X can't have conjugated double bonds, but they can have triple bonds or isolated double bonds.

Wait, but alkyne hydrogenation would produce alkanes. So, if X's components are alkynes, their hydrogenation would yield alkanes. But the problem says that Y is a mixture of two liquids formed via a disproportionation, not via hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the components in X are alkynes, and the reaction with Pt and heat is a dehydrohalogenation or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration. For example, alkynes can be hydrated to ketones under certain conditions. But that would require specific catalysts and conditions, and the problem states that the reaction is a disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon heating with Pt, undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a terminal alkyne, which under certain conditions can form an enol or undergo some other reaction. But I'm not confident about this.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the fact that Z is cyclobutane (C4H8), which has a H% of 14.28%, and then work backward to find what X's components are.

If Z is C4H8, then X's components must be alkenes that, when hydrogenated, produce C4H8, which is cyclobutane.

So, for example, if X's components are cyclobutene (C4H6), which upon hydrogenation gives cyclobutane (C4H8). But cyclobutene is a single compound, so if X is a mixture of cyclobutene and another compound, perhaps another cyclic alkene, like cyclopentene, but cyclopentene upon hydrogenation would give cyclopentane, not cyclobutane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and another diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the components in X are cyclic dienes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X's components are alkenes with branching, like 2-methylpropene (isobutylene), but when hydrogenated, that would give 2-methylpropane (isobutane), which is C4H10, which doesn't fit with Z being C4H8.

Wait, but Z is C4H8, so perhaps the alkenes in X are C4H6. So, for example, 1,2-dichloroethene or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, each of which is C4H6, which upon hydrogenation become C4H8. So, for example, 1,2-dichloroethene and another C4H6 alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the total number of hydrogen atoms in X's two liquids. So if each component in X is C4H6, then each has 6 H. So two components would have 6*2=12 H. But the options are 12 (D), 16 (A), etc.

But wait, maybe each component in X is C4H6. So two components would contribute 6*2 =12 H in total. But that's option D. But is that correct?

Wait, but according to the problem, Z is C4H8, which would be formed by adding H2 to X's components. So, each component in X must be an alkene with formula C4H6, which upon hydrogenation (adding 2 H's) becomes C4H8.

So if X is a mixture of two C4H6 alkenes, then each has 6 H. So the total would be 6*2=12 H atoms in X's mixture.

Wait, but that would make the total H atoms in X 12, which is option D.

But wait, the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So if each component is C4H6, then each contributes 6 H per molecule. So for each mole of each component, 6 moles of H are present. So for 1 mole of each, total H is 12 moles.

But if that's the case, the answer would be 12, which is option D.

But wait, I should make sure that this fits all the other parts of the problem.

So, let's recap:

- X is a mixture of two C4H6 alkenes, which decolorize bromine.
- When treated with Pt and heat, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, a mixture of two alkanes (C4H10?), which don't decolorize bromine.
- Hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is C4H8 (cyclobutane), with 14.28% H.
- Hydrogenation of Y would give Z as well, but since Y is a mixture of alkanes, this is a bit confusing. Because alkanes typically don't react with H2 under normal conditions. So perhaps Y's components are alkenes as well, but that contradicts the earlier statement that Y doesn't decolorize bromine.

Wait, no, Y is formed from X via a reaction, which is a disproportionation. So perhaps Y's components are alkanes, and their hydrogenation would not change anything. But the problem says that both X and Y when hydrogenated give Z. So Y must be a mixture of compounds that, when hydrogenated, give Z. But if Y is a mixture of alkanes, how can they hydrogenate to Z? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y's components are alkenes as well, but that would mean Y's components would decolorize bromine, which they don't. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X's components are each a di-substituted alkene that, upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement to form Y's alkanes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are something else, like allenes or conjugated dienes, but the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.

Wait, perhaps X's components are each a single alkene without conjugation, such as 1-pentene and 2-pentene. But their hydrogenation would give pentane, which is C5H12. H% is 12/(60+12) =12/72=16.66%, which doesn't match Z's 14.28%.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, and Z's properties.

As earlier, Z is C4H8 (cyclobutane) with H% 14.28%. So X's components must be C4H6 alkenes. If X is a mixture of two C4H6 alkenes, each with 6 H, then total H in X is 12.

So the answer would be 12, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure about Y's components. But given the calculations, this seems to fit.

The problem involves analyzing a chemical reaction sequence to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mixture X**: X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes). These liquids are likely alkenes since they are described as "no conjugated multiple bonds."

2. **Mixture Y**: When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. This suggests that Y contains saturated compounds (alkanes).

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both X and Y, when hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z. Z is identified as cyclobutane (C₄H₈), as its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. This matches the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Hydrogen mass fraction} = \frac{\text{Mass of H}}{\text{Molar mass of Z}} = \frac{8}{56} = 0.1428 \, (14.28\%).
   \]

4. **Structure of X**: Since Z is the product of hydrogenation, X must contain alkenes that hydrogenate to form Z. For Z to be C₄H₈, the components of X must be C₄H₆ alkenes. Two such alkenes, each containing 6 hydrogen atoms, form the mixture X.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: Each component of X contributes 6 hydrogen atoms. Since X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12.
   \]

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **12**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Then, when X is treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes some reaction to form Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two different liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. 

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they each give a single substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated, maybe an alkane or something without double bonds.

The question is about the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A) 16, B) 18, C) 22, D) 12.

Hmm. Let me think about each part step by step.

First, mixture X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. What liquids make bromine water decolorize? Well, that's typically things with unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes. Because bromine adds across double bonds, causing the solution to decolorize.

So X must have two components, each of which is an alkene or alkyne. Since they're liquids, maybe they are smaller alkenes or perhaps cyclic structures.

Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. The reaction is a disproportionation reaction, meaning one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but since X is a mixture of two liquids, maybe each undergoes some kind of reaction. Hmm, perhaps each component in X is a diene or something that can undergo some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo some addition or other reaction when heated with Pt.

Wait, the product Y is from a disproportionation, which suggests that each component in X might be a single substance that undergoes a disproportionation. But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a different reaction, but in a way that their products form Y as a mixture of two other liquids. But the problem says Y is from the disproportionation of X. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question says that when X is treated with Pt when heated, it undergoes a disproportionation and forms Y. So perhaps X is a single compound, but wait no, X is a mixture of two. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing. Maybe each component of X is a different compound that, when treated with Pt, undergoes a different reaction, but the overall result is Y being a mixture of two new compounds. Maybe each component of X is an alkene that undergoes hydrogenation, but that might not be a disproportionation.

Wait, let's think again. Disproportionation is when a single species both loses and gains electrons. So for example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, each O atom is both oxidized and reduced. But in this case, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of these two liquids undergoes a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, and each of them undergoes a reaction that causes a change in their structure, leading to Y's components.

Wait, maybe each of the components in X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon heating with Pt, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, perhaps each undergoes hydrogenation, but in a way that leads to two different products. But then, in that case, perhaps the alkenes are of different structures, leading to different alkanes in Y.

Wait, but the problem states that Y's mixture doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests Y's components are saturated, i.e., alkanes, because alkanes don't have double bonds to react with bromine.

So, X's components are unsaturated (they can decolorize bromine), Y's are saturated (so no decolorization). So X's components are alkenes or alkynes, and Y's are alkanes.

So, maybe each component in X is an alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes an alkane. But wait, hydrogenation of alkenes would produce alkanes, but if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each would hydrogenate to a different alkane, making Y a mixture of these two alkanes.

But then, what kind of reaction would that be? Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen, but that's just addition, not a disproportionation. Oh, wait, the problem says that Y is formed as a result of a disproportionation. Hmm. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the components in X each are undergoing some kind of structural change, not just hydrogenation. Maybe each component is something like an alkene that undergoes a rearrangement, such as a cyclopropane opening or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the components in X are dienes or something else that could lead to different products upon hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps each of X's components undergoes a different reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, moving on to the next part: when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they each give only one substance Z. So, hydrogenating X gives Z, and hydrogenating Y also gives Z. Since X is a mixture, perhaps each component in X, when hydrogenated, gives Z. Similarly, each component in Y, when hydrogenated, gives Z. But wait, Y is a mixture of two alkanes, which are already saturated. So if you hydrogenate them, they wouldn't react further because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions. Unless under severe conditions, like high pressure or high temperature, perhaps some isomerization happens? But the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So maybe Z is an alkane, and that's all there is to it.

Wait, but if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, then hydrogenating them might not produce anything, or perhaps they are already alkanes. So maybe that's a clue. Because if Y is two alkanes, then hydrogenation of Y would give the same alkanes, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So perhaps when you hydrogenate X, each component in X (the alkenes) becomes Z, and when you hydrogenate Y (which is a mixture of alkanes and maybe another substance?), but wait, Y is formed from X via a reaction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should focus on the data given about substance Z.

Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let me calculate its molecular formula. The hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So 14.28% is roughly 14.28/100 = 0.1428. Let's compute the molecular formula.

Assuming Z is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me try to find integers n and m that satisfy this. Let's rearrange:

m / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = (12n + m)/7.

Multiply both sides by 7:

7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.

So, m is twice n. So the formula is CnH2n. So that's an alkene? Wait, but Z is formed by hydrogenation of both X and Y. Wait, but wait, if X's components are alkenes, then hydrogenating X would add H2 across the double bonds, converting them into alkanes. But the problem says that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of H being 14.28%, which we found to be CnH2n. That would be an alkene, but that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation would make it into an alkane.

Wait, unless I made a mistake. Let me recheck. If Z is a hydrocarbon resulting from hydrogenation, it must be an alkane. Because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, converting alkenes to alkanes. So Z must be an alkane, which would have the formula CnH2n+2. But according to the mass fraction, H is 14.28%, which is 1/7.

So, let's compute again. Let's assume Z is an alkane, so the formula is CnH2n+2.

Mass fraction of H is (2n+2)*1 / [12n + (2n+2)] = (2n+2)/(14n + 2).

We can set this equal to 0.1428 (approx 1/7).

So:

(2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying:

7*(2n +2) = 14n + 2.

14n + 14 = 14n + 2.

Subtract 14n from both sides:

14 = 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So that indicates a problem. So perhaps my assumption that Z is an alkane is wrong, even though it's the product of hydrogenation. Hmm, maybe Z isn't an alkane, but another type of hydrocarbon.

Wait, but the problem says that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which suggests that it's saturated, so alkane. But the calculation leads to a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So:

H% = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So,

7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene, not an alkane. Hmm, but then if Z is an alkene, how could it be the product of hydrogenation? Because hydrogenation would add H2 to alkenes to make alkanes. So this is a contradiction. So maybe I made an error in my approach.

Wait, maybe Z isn't from the hydrogenation of Y's components. Wait, the problem says, "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance Z". That suggests that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. And when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives Z. So if X's components are alkenes, hydrogenating them would give alkanes, which would be Z. But Z's H% suggests an alkene. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait another angle: perhaps X's components are alkenes, and when they're hydrogenated, they become alkanes, but then Z is an alkane. The H% would then have to fit an alkane. Let me recalculate with the alkane formula.

Assume Z is CnH2n+2. H% is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n + 2) = 14.28%.

Set this equal to 1/7:

(2n+2)/(14n + 2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n + 2 = (14n +2)/7 → 7*(2n + 2) = 14n + 2 → 14n +14 =14n +2 → 14=2. That's impossible, so that approach is wrong.

Hmm. So perhaps Z is a cycloalkane or something else. Or maybe the hydrogenation isn't adding H2 but doing something else. Alternatively, perhaps Z is a different kind of compound. Wait, maybe Z is a benzene ring with all the H's, but if so, that would be a cyclohexane, which is an alkane.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Z is toluene? No, because toluene isn't an alkane. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a smaller molecule. Let's try n=1. Then m=2 (from m=2n). So Z would be CH2, which is impossible. n=2: m=4 → C2H4, which is ethylene. H% is (4)/(24+4) =4/28 ≈14.28%. Oh! That's exactly the given value.

So Z is C2H4 (ethylene), but wait, that's an alkene. But how could hydrogenation lead to it? Because ethylene is an alkene, which would normally be hydrogenated to ethane (alkane). But the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So ethylene would react with hydrogen, adding two H's to become ethane. But if Z is ethylene, that's an alkene, and according to the problem, it doesn't react further with hydrogen. That can't be right because ethylene would react with H2 under hydrogenation conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting something wrong. Let me check the calculation again. If n=2, m=4. So molecular formula is C2H4. The molar mass is 28 g/mol. H mass is 4 g. So 4/28 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Yes, that's correct. So Z is C2H4, which is ethylene.

But wait, ethylene is an alkene. So if you hydrogenate ethylene, you get ethane. But the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So Y's components would have to hydrogenate to ethylene. But ethylene is an alkene, which doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of alkanes would not change anything. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Let me rethink. Maybe Z has a lower molecular weight. Let's try n=1: m=2 → C H2 is not a stable molecule. So that's impossible.

n=3: m=6 → C3H6. H% is 6/(36+6)=6/42=14.28%. So that works. So Z could be C3H6. But C3H6 can be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but if Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation, then perhaps it's propene. But then, hydrogenation of propene would give propane, an alkane. But according to the problem, hydrogenation gives Z. So if Z is propene, that's an alkene, which would require that the starting material was something else that upon hydrogenation gives propene. That seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. Then, if X's components are something that, upon hydrogenation, become cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is an alkane, so maybe the hydrogenation of a diene? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y giving Z. So, X is a mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize bromine). When X is hydrogenated, each alkene becomes an alkane. But the problem states that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, hydrogenating X gives Z, and hydrogenating Y gives Z.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes, their hydrogenation would give two alkanes, unless both alkenes hydrogenate to the same alkane Z. That would mean that the two components in X are alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane. So, for example, if X is a mixture of 1-butene and 2-butene, hydrogenation would give butane.

So, perhaps X has two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give the same alkane Z. Similarly, Y is a mixture of two alkanes. But wait, Y is a mixture of two liquids, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z. But wait, if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, they wouldn't hydrogenate further under normal conditions. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are alkyne and something else. Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they can't have triple bonds either. So Y's components must be alkanes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X's components are di-substituted alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give the same alkane. For example, if X has 1-butene and 2-butene, hydrogenating both would give butane. So Z would be butane (C4H10), which is an alkane.

Then, let's check the H% for butane. Butane is C4H10. The molar mass is 58 g/mol. H mass is 10 g. 10/58 ≈ 0.1724 or 17.24%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that doesn't match.

Wait, let's compute for another alkane. Let's see, for ethane (C2H6): H% is 6/(24+6) =6/30=0.2 → 20%. No, that's higher than 14.28%.

For propane (C3H8): H% is 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%. Still higher.

For pentane (C5H12): 12/(60+12)=12/72=16.66%. Closer, but still not 14.28%.

Wait, what about cyclopropane (C3H6)? Its molecular formula is C3H6, which is 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens. The molar mass is 42 g/mol. H% is 6/42=14.28%, which matches.

So Z is cyclopropane, which is an alkane, and its H% is 14.28%. That fits.

So if Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), then what is X? X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclopropane. Wait, but adding H2 to an alkene would only add two hydrogens. For example, if X's components are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, cyclopropane is a ring structure, so perhaps X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps X's components are alkenes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclopropane rings with double bonds elsewhere, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the components in X are more complex structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of X. X is a mixture of two alkenes. Each, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, cyclopropane has a ring of three carbons. So, perhaps each component in X is a cyclopropane with a substituent that is a double bond. Wait, but that's not possible because cyclopropane itself is a saturated ring. Alternatively, perhaps X's components are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, that seems odd. Let's think about cyclopropane as the product. How would that happen? Maybe the alkenes are strained or part of a ring. Hmm, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes are in a position that, when hydrogenated, forms a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are not simple alkenes but something else, like allenes (cumulative dienes) or conjugated dienes. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: since X's components are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclopropane. So, when an alkene reacts with H2 in the presence of a catalyst, it adds H2 across the double bond to form an alkane. So, to form cyclopropane, the starting alkene must have been cyclopropane with a double bond. Wait, but cyclopropane itself doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a larger ring that, upon hydrogenation, becomes a smaller ring. For instance, if X's components are cyclobutene (a 4-membered ring with a double bond), hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, converting it into cyclobutane. But cyclobutane isn't cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are substituted in a way that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. For example, if X has a molecule where a hydrogen is added across a double bond to form a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogen is added, it forms a bridge, leading to a cyclopropane. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes are strained, like norbornene or something else. But I'm not very confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are propenes with substituents, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with an exocyclic double bond. For example, 1-cyclopropene or something similar. But I'm not sure if that's a real compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but allenes (cumulative dienes). If each component is a di-alkene, their hydrogenation would add H2 in such a way as to form cyclopropane. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says that no conjugated multiple bonds are present in the molecules of X's components. So, each component in X is a non-conjugated diene or a single alkene without any conjugation. So perhaps each is a single, isolated double bond.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with a single, isolated double bond (no conjugation). When treated with Pt and heat, undergoes a reaction leading to Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes. Also, the reaction is a disproportionation, which suggests that perhaps each component in X is undergoing a different kind of reaction.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, and each is hydrogenated to form a different alkane, then Y would be a mixture of two alkanes. But the problem says Y is a mixture of two liquids, and each component in Y is the product of a disproportionation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the reaction when X is treated with Pt is not hydrogenation but something else. Since it's a disproportionation, perhaps each molecule in X is a single species that can be oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe each component of X is undergoing a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo a rearrangement when heated. For example, maybe each component is a cyclic diene that rearranges upon heating. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the components in X are undergoing dehydrohalogenation or some elimination, but that doesn't fit with the problem description.

Wait, another thought: since Y is formed via a disproportionation of X, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should instead focus on the fact that Z is cyclopropane, as that seems to fit the H% data. So, if Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), and it's the product of hydrogenation from X and Y, then let's think about what X and Y would be.

Hydrogenation of X gives Z. So X must be a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, each become cyclopropane. But that's not possible because alkenes upon hydrogenation become alkanes. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying Z.

Wait, let me try another approach. If Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H, and it's an alkane, let's try to find another possibility. Let's assume Z is C3H8 (propane). H% is 8/ (36+8) =8/44=18.18%, which is higher than 14.28%. So no.

Wait, maybe Z is a different kind of hydrocarbon, like a cycloalkane with a higher molecular weight. Let's try C4H8. Wait, 8/(48 +8)=8/56=14.28% exactly. So Z could be cyclobutane, which is C4H8. But wait, cyclobutane is an alkane, and its H% is 8/56=14.28%. That fits.

So Z is cyclobutane (C4H8). Now, when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclobutane. So X's components must be alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, become cyclobutane. So, for example, if X's components are 1,3-butadiene? No, wait, 1,3-butadiene is a diene, but adding H2 would give butane, not cyclobutane. Alternatively, if X's components are cyclobutene, which upon hydrogenation would become cyclobutane.

Ah, that makes sense. Cyclobutene (C4H6) is a cyclic alkene. Adding H2 across the double bond would yield cyclobutane (C4H8). So if X is a mixture of cyclobutene and another cyclic alkene, say cyclobutene and another compound that also hydrogenates to cyclobutane. Wait, but cyclobutene is a single compound, so perhaps X is a mixture of two different cyclic alkenes that each hydrogenate to cyclobutane. For example, cyclobutene and another structure.

Wait, but cyclobutene is C4H6. But if X is a mixture of cyclobutene and another cyclic alkene that also, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclobutane, then for each component, the addition of H2 across the double bond would produce cyclobutane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes that each, when hydrogenated, produce cyclobutane, then that's possible. For example, maybe X contains a mixture of cyclobutene and another cyclic alkene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X contains cyclopentene and something else that hydrogenates to cyclobutane. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes that each hydrogenate to cyclobutane. For example, 1,2-dichloroethene and something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids formed from X via a disproportionation. So perhaps X's components each undergo a disproportionation reaction when heated with Pt, leading to Y's components. So, for example, each component in X is a molecule that can both lose and gain electrons (disproportionation).

Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the problem again.

The problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids (alkenes or alkynes) that decolorize bromine water. Y is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine (alkanes or possibly other saturated compounds). When X is heated with Pt, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.

So perhaps each component of X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon heating, undergoes a rearrangement via a metal catalyst. For example, maybe each component undergoes a hydrogen shift or ring formation.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the components in X are allylic alkanes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps they are cumulenes or allenes, which can undergo some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is an alkyne. Because alkyne decolorizes bromine water as well. But the problem says that X's components have no conjugated multiple bonds, which would include triple bonds as well. Wait, no, triple bonds are considered conjugated if they are part of a conjugated system. Wait, but the problem says, "no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X." So perhaps each component in X can't have conjugated double bonds, but they can have triple bonds or isolated double bonds.

Wait, but alkyne hydrogenation would produce alkanes. So, if X's components are alkynes, their hydrogenation would yield alkanes. But the problem says that Y is a mixture of two liquids formed via a disproportionation, not via hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the components in X are alkynes, and the reaction with Pt and heat is a dehydrohalogenation or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration. For example, alkynes can be hydrated to ketones under certain conditions. But that would require specific catalysts and conditions, and the problem states that the reaction is a disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon heating with Pt, undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a terminal alkyne, which under certain conditions can form an enol or undergo some other reaction. But I'm not confident about this.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the fact that Z is cyclobutane (C4H8), which has a H% of 14.28%, and then work backward to find what X's components are.

If Z is C4H8, then X's components must be alkenes that, when hydrogenated, produce C4H8, which is cyclobutane.

So, for example, if X's components are cyclobutene (C4H6), which upon hydrogenation gives cyclobutane (C4H8). But cyclobutene is a single compound, so if X is a mixture of cyclobutene and another compound, perhaps another cyclic alkene, like cyclopentene, but cyclopentene upon hydrogenation would give cyclopentane, not cyclobutane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and another diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the components in X are cyclic dienes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X's components are alkenes with branching, like 2-methylpropene (isobutylene), but when hydrogenated, that would give 2-methylpropane (isobutane), which is C4H10, which doesn't fit with Z being C4H8.

Wait, but Z is C4H8, so perhaps the alkenes in X are C4H6. So, for example, 1,2-dichloroethene or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, each of which is C4H6, which upon hydrogenation become C4H8. So, for example, 1,2-dichloroethene and another C4H6 alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the total number of hydrogen atoms in X's two liquids. So if each component in X is C4H6, then each has 6 H. So two components would have 6*2=12 H. But the options are 12 (D), 16 (A), etc.

But wait, maybe each component in X is C4H6. So two components would contribute 6*2 =12 H in total. But that's option D. But is that correct?

Wait, but according to the problem, Z is C4H8, which would be formed by adding H2 to X's components. So, each component in X must be an alkene with formula C4H6, which upon hydrogenation (adding 2 H's) becomes C4H8.

So if X is a mixture of two C4H6 alkenes, then each has 6 H. So the total would be 6*2=12 H atoms in X's mixture.

Wait, but that would make the total H atoms in X 12, which is option D.

But wait, the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So if each component is C4H6, then each contributes 6 H per molecule. So for each mole of each component, 6 moles of H are present. So for 1 mole of each, total H is 12 moles.

But if that's the case, the answer would be 12, which is option D.

But wait, I should make sure that this fits all the other parts of the problem.

So, let's recap:

- X is a mixture of two C4H6 alkenes, which decolorize bromine.
- When treated with Pt and heat, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, a mixture of two alkanes (C4H10?), which don't decolorize bromine.
- Hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is C4H8 (cyclobutane), with 14.28% H.
- Hydrogenation of Y would give Z as well, but since Y is a mixture of alkanes, this is a bit confusing. Because alkanes typically don't react with H2 under normal conditions. So perhaps Y's components are alkenes as well, but that contradicts the earlier statement that Y doesn't decolorize bromine.

Wait, no, Y is formed from X via a reaction, which is a disproportionation. So perhaps Y's components are alkanes, and their hydrogenation would not change anything. But the problem says that both X and Y when hydrogenated give Z. So Y must be a mixture of compounds that, when hydrogenated, give Z. But if Y is a mixture of alkanes, how can they hydrogenate to Z? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y's components are alkenes as well, but that would mean Y's components would decolorize bromine, which they don't. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X's components are each a di-substituted alkene that, upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement to form Y's alkanes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are something else, like allenes or conjugated dienes, but the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.

Wait, perhaps X's components are each a single alkene without conjugation, such as 1-pentene and 2-pentene. But their hydrogenation would give pentane, which is C5H12. H% is 12/(60+12) =12/72=16.66%, which doesn't match Z's 14.28%.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, and Z's properties.

As earlier, Z is C4H8 (cyclobutane) with H% 14.28%. So X's components must be C4H6 alkenes. If X is a mixture of two C4H6 alkenes, each with 6 H, then total H in X is 12.

So the answer would be 12, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure about Y's components. But given the calculations, this seems to fit.


The problem involves analyzing a chemical reaction sequence to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mixture X**: X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes). These liquids are likely alkenes since they are described as "no conjugated multiple bonds."

2. **Mixture Y**: When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. This suggests that Y contains saturated compounds (alkanes).

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both X and Y, when hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z. Z is identified as cyclobutane (C₄H₈), as its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. This matches the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Hydrogen mass fraction} = \frac{\text{Mass of H}}{\text{Molar mass of Z}} = \frac{8}{56} = 0.1428 \, (14.28\%).
   \]

4. **Structure of X**: Since Z is the product of hydrogenation, X must contain alkenes that hydrogenate to form Z. For Z to be C₄H₈, the components of X must be C₄H₆ alkenes. Two such alkenes, each containing 6 hydrogen atoms, form the mixture X.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: Each component of X contributes 6 hydrogen atoms. Since X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12.
   \]

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **12**.
