Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's energy states and what photon momentum is needed for a transition. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in such models, the energy levels consider both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and the next lowest energy state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state.

Wait, the fundamental state for vibrations is the lowest vibrational state, n=0. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, the next state would probably be the next vibrational state, n=1, or maybe a rotational transition? Or perhaps what's considered the next state if we're only looking at a single transition.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, right, so in quantum mechanics, the molecule can transition between states where either the vibrational or rotational quantum numbers change. But the lowest energy transition would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So I need to find what that transition is.

But wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the ground state for rotation would be J=0, and for vibration, n=0. The next state could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Let me consider the energy levels for rotation and vibration. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2) h nu, where nu is the frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) hbar^2 )/( 2I ), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference for a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2 ) h nu = h nu. For rotational transitions, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be [ (2)(3) - 0 ] (hbar^2/(2I)) ) = (6 hbar^2)/(2I) )= 3 hbar^2/(2I). Hmm, but which one is smaller, the vibrational or the rotational transition?

Wait, vibrational transitions typically have higher energy than rotational, so the next state with the lowest possible energy would be a rotational transition. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think about the actual values.

The given parameters are mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So the reduced mass mu would be (20*2)/(20+2) )= (40)/(22) ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, the formula for the reduced mass is mu = (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). So yeah, that would be 20*2/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So when the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational (n=0) and rotational (J=0) state.

So the next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. But which has a lower energy difference?

Let me compute both energy differences.

First, vibrational energy difference: delta E_vibrational = h nu. Wait, since the angular frequency w is given, we can find the frequency nu = w/(2 pi). So nu = 4e14 / (2 pi) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So delta E_vibrational = h nu = 6.626e-34 Js * 6.366e13 Hz ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Now the rotational energy difference. The rotational energy for J=0 is E_0 = 0. For J=1, E_1 = (1*(1+1)) * hbar^2/(2I) ) = (2) * hbar^2/(2I) )= hbar^2/(I).

Wait, the moment of inertia I is mu * R^2. So mu is 1.818 amu, which is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg. So I = mu * R^2 = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 *4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

Now, hbar is h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 Js.

So E_1 = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.196e-46) ) J.

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.196e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 ≈ 9.3e-23 J. So delta E_rotational is about 9.3e-23 J.

Comparing the two: 4.21e-20 J (vibrational) vs 9.3e-23 J (rotational). So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state would be J=1, n=0.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the energy difference for a rotational transition is much smaller than the vibrational one. Therefore, the photon would have to provide the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the order. What if the molecule is in the fundamental state but can transition to a higher rotational state or vibrational state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the lower energy transition.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm. Because the ground state is the lowest, the next state would be the one that's just above it. So the energy difference would be the smallest possible. So between (n=0, J=1) and (n=1, J=0), which has the smaller delta E? The J=1, n=0 transition is lower.

So the photon's energy would be E = delta E_rot = 9.3e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Because the photon's energy is E = p c, but wait, photons also carry momentum p = E/c. So to find the momentum, perhaps we need to calculate p_photon = E_photon / c.

Wait, but wait. Oh, photons have energy E = h f, and momentum p = E/c. So if the energy required is delta E_rot, then p = delta E_rot / c.

Wait, but I have to be careful. The energy of the photon should match the energy difference required. So the energy of the photon is E_photon = delta E, so p_photon = E_photon / c.

Hmm, but wait, in some cases, like in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized, and transitions are between adjacent J states. But for the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are treated as a combination of rotation and vibration. Do the transitions occur between different J states within the same vibrational state, or between vibrational states with J fixed? Or perhaps in the rigid rotor, the rotational energy is considered separately, but when it's non-rigid, maybe the vibrational and rotational are coupled.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about when the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is n=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the state with the smallest energy increment. As calculated, the rotational transition to J=1 is much lower energy (approx 9.3e-23 J) than the vibrational transition (4.21e-20 J). So the photon's energy is 9.3e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), what is the next possible state in energy? The next state could be (n=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition, or (n=1, J=0), which is a vibrational transition. So which one has a lower energy difference?

As calculated, the rotational transition delta E is about 9.3e-23 J, and the vibrational is about 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower. So the photon must provide 9.3e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum is E / c = (9.3e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me calculate that numerically.

E_rot = 9.3e-23 J

p = E_rot / c = 9.3e-23 / 3e8 = 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are anywhere near that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are in the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units are correct.

Wait, 1e-28 Ns is 1e-28 kg·m/s. Our calculation gives 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.1e-31 Ns. Not matching any options. Hmm. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the energy transition. Maybe the molecule can transition from (J=0, n=0) to (J=1, n=0) or (J=0, n=1), but perhaps the next state in energy is the vibrational, not the rotational. But that can't be, because the energy difference was much smaller for the rotational.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the vibrational transition's photon momentum.

E_vibr = 4.2e-20 J.

p_photon = E_vibr / c = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s = 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's matching.

But why is that the answer? Because perhaps the next state is the vibrational, not the rotational. But wait, the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon need to supply more? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the rotational energy calculation.

Let me recalculate E_J.

E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * (hbar²) / (2I )

For J=0: E_0 = 0
For J=1: E_1 = (2) * (hbar²/(2I) ) )= hbar²/(I)

Wait, hbar is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

hbar squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = mu * R^2.

mu = (20 * 2 )/(22 ) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = mu * R² = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

E_J for J=1 is (hbar^2) / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 ≈ 9.3e-23 J.

So that seems correct.

So the rotational transition's energy is 9.3e-23 J, which would imply a photon momentum of 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the photon to cause a transition to a higher vibrational state, not a rotational one. Maybe I misunderstood the model.

Wait, the question says "non-rigid rotor model." In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, which is more like a vibration. So perhaps the model combines rotation and vibration, and the energy levels are quantized considering both.

Wait, but in that case, the energy levels would be a combination of rotational and vibrational. So perhaps the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

In the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational (n=0) and lowest rotational (J=0). The next state would be either n=1 or J=1.

So the energy difference between n=0, J=0 and n=1, J=0 would be delta E_vibrational = h nu = 4.21e-20 J.

Alternatively, the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 in the same vibrational state (n=0) is delta E_rot = 9.3e-23 J.

So the next possible state would be the one with the lower energy difference, which is the rotational one. So the photon should have E_photon = 9.3e-23 J.

But wait, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a purely rotational transition, ignoring the vibrational part. Or perhaps the model is such that the energy levels are quantized in a way that the next state is a combination of both.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can transition to a state where both J increases and n increases, but that's probably not the case for the "lowest possible energy" transition.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition where the molecule goes into the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. The "next state with the lowest possible energy" refers to the state with the smallest possible energy above the current.

So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state (n=0, J=0) and the next state (either n=1 or J=1) whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, but as calculated, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is E_rot.

So the momentum p = E/c = 9.3e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.1e-31 kg m/s = 3.1e-31 N·s.

Wait, but none of the options match. The options are all around 1e-28 or 1e-27 Ns.

So perhaps I made an error in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for rotational energy.

Wait, the formula for rotational energy levels is E_J = (J(J+1) hbar² )/(2I )

For J=1: E_1 = (2) * hbar²/(2I) )= hbar²/(I).

Wait, let me recalculate I.

I = mu * R^2.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 amu.

20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg, which is 3.32e-26 kg.

Wait, no, mu is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * amu.

So mu = (40) / 22 * 1.66e-27 kg.

40/22 is about 1.818.

So mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

I = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

hbar is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

hbar squared: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_J for J=1: (hbar²)/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 = approximately 9.3e-23 J.

So that's correct.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. Let me recalculate the vibrational E.

Given w = 4e14 rad/s.

Frequency nu = w/(2pi) = 4e14 / (6.2832) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

E_vibrational transition (n=0 → n=1) is h nu = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

So p_photon = E/c = 4.21e-20 / 3e8 = 1.403e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's the same as this calculation.

So why is this happening? Because maybe the rotational transition is not possible, or perhaps the model doesn't allow such a transition. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. But in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length is not fixed, so perhaps the rotational energy levels are not quantized as in the rigid rotor.

Wait, but the question states that the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps it's a combined model, and the allowed transitions involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, as the main contributor to the energy change when a photon is absorbed.

Wait, if the photon has to provide the energy for the next state, and the next state is the lowest possible energy, which could be a vibrational transition, then the photon's momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, which would be the next state. So why is the answer matching the vibrational?

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state in terms of energy level, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So the "next state" is the one with the next higher energy, which could be either vibrational or rotational.

But the next state in energy would be the one with the smallest delta E. So if delta E_rot is smaller than delta E_vibr, then the rotational transition is the next.

But in that case, the calculated photon momentum would be 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the model expects the question to consider only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rigid rotor model, in which case the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_J = (J (J+1) hbar^2 )/(2I ), and the next state is J=1. So delta E_rot is 9.3e-23 J.

But again, that doesn't match any options.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as the sum of both rotational and vibrational contributions, and the next state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which could be either a change in J or n.

But in that case, the energy difference would be the minimum of delta E_rot and delta E_vibr. As delta E_rot is smaller, the photon's momentum would be based on delta E_rot.

But I don't see an option matching that.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, which is similar to the vibrational energy's photon momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the rotational energy because I forgot to account for the centrifugal distortion, but I don't think that would change the order of magnitude.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), and the next state is the first excited state, which is (n=1, J=0). So the energy difference would be the vibrational delta E.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because in terms of energy, the rotational transition would require less energy, so it would come before the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are ordered such that the first excited state is J=1, n=0, but the problem is that the rotational transition's energy is lower, so it's the first possible.

But if the question states that the molecule is switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, then the photon must supply the energy for the smallest delta E, which is the rotational.

Hmm. So I'm confused because the calculation with the rotational transition doesn't match any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me try again.

E_J for J=1 is (2) * (hbar^2/(2I)) )= (hbar^2)/(I).

hbar^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68.

I = mu * R².

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = 40/22 amu = 1.818 amu.

20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

I = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 *4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

So E_J = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 = approximately 9.3e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.3e-23 J, which gives p_photon = 9.3e-23 / 3e8 = 3.1e-31 Ns.

But options don't have this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the energy difference between the rotational levels and not considering the vibrational.

Wait, but in that case, the photon's energy is 9.3e-23 J, which gives 3.1e-31 N·s. None of the options are close.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total energy, which includes both rotational and vibrational. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the rotational part only, ignoring the vibrational. So the photon's momentum is based on the rotational delta E.

But again, the calculation leads to 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps the given options are in a different unit or I made a miscalculation. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s. My calculation for the vibrational transition gives 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the model expects that the next state is the vibrational one, not the rotational. But why would that be the case?

Maybe because the vibrational energy is quantized, and transitions are allowed only between certain states, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the molecule's energy in the context of the rigid rotor only, not the rotation-vibration model. But the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, perhaps the model combines both, and the energy levels are a sum of rotational and vibrational.

Wait, so the fundamental state is (n=0, J=0), and the next state could be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0), whichever has the lower energy. But as previously calculated, the energy delta for J=1 is smaller than for n=1.

So the photon should provide the energy for J=1 transition.

But again, the calculation leads to a momentum not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the model. Let me think again.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model treats the bond as having variable length, so the moment of inertia varies, and this affects the rotational energy levels. But I'm not sure how that changes the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the molecule is a rigid rotor and that the transition is purely rotational.

But the question says non-rigid, so that's probably not the case.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The correct answer is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So perhaps the model expects that the next state is a vibrational transition, despite the rotational being lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for E_J.

Wait, E_J = (J (J+1) hbar² )/(2I )

So for J=1, E_1 = (2) * hbar²/(2I) = hbar²/(I).

But perhaps I forgot to convert the units correctly.

Wait, let me re-calculate I.

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = (40)/(22) = 1.818 amu.

mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 2.99e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = mu R^2 = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

hbar = 1.05457e-34 J s.

hbar² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_J = hbar² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 = approx 9.3e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So I'm confident in the calculation, but it's not matching the options. So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next state with the next higher energy, which would be the vibrational state, but that would be incorrect because the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a typo, but that's beyond my control.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the energy difference. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the transition from J=0 to J=1 requires a photon of energy delta E = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = E_J=1.

But wait, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1)) hbar²/(2I).

So E_J=1 = (2) hbar²/(2I) )= hbar²/(I), which is the same as before.

So I'm not missing any factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as if it's the change in the molecule's momentum, but that doesn't make sense, because the photon's momentum is what causes the transition.

Wait, maybe I should think about the selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So the molecule can go from J=0 to J=1.

But perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the selection rules are different, but I don't think that changes the energy calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure why.

If delta E is 4.21e-20 J, then p_photon is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is not quantized as in the rigid rotor, or perhaps because the problem is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to the next vibrational state, which is the first possible state when considering only vibrational transitions.

But in that case, the rotational transition would have a lower energy. So perhaps the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational.

So the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vibr.

E_rot = (J (J+1) hbar² )/(2I )

E_vibr = (n + 1/2) h nu.

So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0.

The next possible state could be either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1). Which has a lower energy?

E1 = E_vibr (n=1) = (1 + 1/2) h nu = (3/2) h nu.

E2 = E_rot (J=1) = (1*2 hbar²)/(2I) )= (2 hbar²)/(2I) )= hbar²/I.

Which is smaller between E1 and E2?

E1 = (3/2) h nu = (3/2)*6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ (3/2) *4.21e-20 ≈ 6.316e-20 J.

E2 = 9.3e-23 J.

So E2 is much smaller. So the next state is (n=0, J=1), requiring a photon of 9.3e-23 J.

Which again, doesn't match any options.

But perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning to the next vibrational state, assuming that the rotational state is already at J=0, the lowest, so the next state is vibrational.

But that would be incorrect because the rotational transition requires less energy.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the only one matching my vibrational calculation is option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. So perhaps that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (\( n = 0 \)) and the lowest rotational state (\( J = 0 \)).

3. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a **rotational transition** (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)) or a **vibrational transition** (\( n = 0 \to n = 1 \)).

---

### Rotational Energy Transition:
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_J = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's energy states and what photon momentum is needed for a transition. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in such models, the energy levels consider both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and the next lowest energy state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state.

Wait, the fundamental state for vibrations is the lowest vibrational state, n=0. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, the next state would probably be the next vibrational state, n=1, or maybe a rotational transition? Or perhaps what's considered the next state if we're only looking at a single transition.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, right, so in quantum mechanics, the molecule can transition between states where either the vibrational or rotational quantum numbers change. But the lowest energy transition would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So I need to find what that transition is.

But wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the ground state for rotation would be J=0, and for vibration, n=0. The next state could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Let me consider the energy levels for rotation and vibration. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2) h nu, where nu is the frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) hbar^2 )/( 2I ), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference for a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2 ) h nu = h nu. For rotational transitions, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be [ (2)(3) - 0 ] (hbar^2/(2I)) ) = (6 hbar^2)/(2I) )= 3 hbar^2/(2I). Hmm, but which one is smaller, the vibrational or the rotational transition?

Wait, vibrational transitions typically have higher energy than rotational, so the next state with the lowest possible energy would be a rotational transition. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think about the actual values.

The given parameters are mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So the reduced mass mu would be (20*2)/(20+2) )= (40)/(22) ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, the formula for the reduced mass is mu = (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). So yeah, that would be 20*2/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So when the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational (n=0) and rotational (J=0) state.

So the next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. But which has a lower energy difference?

Let me compute both energy differences.

First, vibrational energy difference: delta E_vibrational = h nu. Wait, since the angular frequency w is given, we can find the frequency nu = w/(2 pi). So nu = 4e14 / (2 pi) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So delta E_vibrational = h nu = 6.626e-34 Js * 6.366e13 Hz ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Now the rotational energy difference. The rotational energy for J=0 is E_0 = 0. For J=1, E_1 = (1*(1+1)) * hbar^2/(2I) ) = (2) * hbar^2/(2I) )= hbar^2/(I).

Wait, the moment of inertia I is mu * R^2. So mu is 1.818 amu, which is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg. So I = mu * R^2 = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 *4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

Now, hbar is h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 Js.

So E_1 = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.196e-46) ) J.

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.196e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 ≈ 9.3e-23 J. So delta E_rotational is about 9.3e-23 J.

Comparing the two: 4.21e-20 J (vibrational) vs 9.3e-23 J (rotational). So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state would be J=1, n=0.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the energy difference for a rotational transition is much smaller than the vibrational one. Therefore, the photon would have to provide the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the order. What if the molecule is in the fundamental state but can transition to a higher rotational state or vibrational state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the lower energy transition.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm. Because the ground state is the lowest, the next state would be the one that's just above it. So the energy difference would be the smallest possible. So between (n=0, J=1) and (n=1, J=0), which has the smaller delta E? The J=1, n=0 transition is lower.

So the photon's energy would be E = delta E_rot = 9.3e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Because the photon's energy is E = p c, but wait, photons also carry momentum p = E/c. So to find the momentum, perhaps we need to calculate p_photon = E_photon / c.

Wait, but wait. Oh, photons have energy E = h f, and momentum p = E/c. So if the energy required is delta E_rot, then p = delta E_rot / c.

Wait, but I have to be careful. The energy of the photon should match the energy difference required. So the energy of the photon is E_photon = delta E, so p_photon = E_photon / c.

Hmm, but wait, in some cases, like in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized, and transitions are between adjacent J states. But for the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are treated as a combination of rotation and vibration. Do the transitions occur between different J states within the same vibrational state, or between vibrational states with J fixed? Or perhaps in the rigid rotor, the rotational energy is considered separately, but when it's non-rigid, maybe the vibrational and rotational are coupled.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about when the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is n=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the state with the smallest energy increment. As calculated, the rotational transition to J=1 is much lower energy (approx 9.3e-23 J) than the vibrational transition (4.21e-20 J). So the photon's energy is 9.3e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), what is the next possible state in energy? The next state could be (n=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition, or (n=1, J=0), which is a vibrational transition. So which one has a lower energy difference?

As calculated, the rotational transition delta E is about 9.3e-23 J, and the vibrational is about 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower. So the photon must provide 9.3e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum is E / c = (9.3e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me calculate that numerically.

E_rot = 9.3e-23 J

p = E_rot / c = 9.3e-23 / 3e8 = 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are anywhere near that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are in the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units are correct.

Wait, 1e-28 Ns is 1e-28 kg·m/s. Our calculation gives 3.1e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.1e-31 Ns. Not matching any options. Hmm. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the energy transition. Maybe the molecule can transition from (J=0, n=0) to (J=1, n=0) or (J=0, n=1), but perhaps the next state in energy is the vibrational, not the rotational. But that can't be, because the energy difference was much smaller for the rotational.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the vibrational transition's photon momentum.

E_vibr = 4.2e-20 J.

p_photon = E_vibr / c = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s = 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's matching.

But why is that the answer? Because perhaps the next state is the vibrational, not the rotational. But wait, the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon need to supply more? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the rotational energy calculation.

Let me recalculate E_J.

E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * (hbar²) / (2I )

For J=0: E_0 = 0
For J=1: E_1 = (2) * (hbar²/(2I) ) )= hbar²/(I)

Wait, hbar is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

hbar squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = mu * R^2.

mu = (20 * 2 )/(22 ) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = mu * R² = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

E_J for J=1 is (hbar^2) / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 ≈ 9.3e-23 J.

So that seems correct.

So the rotational transition's energy is 9.3e-23 J, which would imply a photon momentum of 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the photon to cause a transition to a higher vibrational state, not a rotational one. Maybe I misunderstood the model.

Wait, the question says "non-rigid rotor model." In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, which is more like a vibration. So perhaps the model combines rotation and vibration, and the energy levels are quantized considering both.

Wait, but in that case, the energy levels would be a combination of rotational and vibrational. So perhaps the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

In the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational (n=0) and lowest rotational (J=0). The next state would be either n=1 or J=1.

So the energy difference between n=0, J=0 and n=1, J=0 would be delta E_vibrational = h nu = 4.21e-20 J.

Alternatively, the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 in the same vibrational state (n=0) is delta E_rot = 9.3e-23 J.

So the next possible state would be the one with the lower energy difference, which is the rotational one. So the photon should have E_photon = 9.3e-23 J.

But wait, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a purely rotational transition, ignoring the vibrational part. Or perhaps the model is such that the energy levels are quantized in a way that the next state is a combination of both.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can transition to a state where both J increases and n increases, but that's probably not the case for the "lowest possible energy" transition.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition where the molecule goes into the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. The "next state with the lowest possible energy" refers to the state with the smallest possible energy above the current.

So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state (n=0, J=0) and the next state (either n=1 or J=1) whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, but as calculated, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is E_rot.

So the momentum p = E/c = 9.3e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.1e-31 kg m/s = 3.1e-31 N·s.

Wait, but none of the options match. The options are all around 1e-28 or 1e-27 Ns.

So perhaps I made an error in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for rotational energy.

Wait, the formula for rotational energy levels is E_J = (J(J+1) hbar² )/(2I )

For J=1: E_1 = (2) * hbar²/(2I) )= hbar²/(I).

Wait, let me recalculate I.

I = mu * R^2.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 amu.

20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg, which is 3.32e-26 kg.

Wait, no, mu is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * amu.

So mu = (40) / 22 * 1.66e-27 kg.

40/22 is about 1.818.

So mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

I = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

hbar is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

hbar squared: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_J for J=1: (hbar²)/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 = approximately 9.3e-23 J.

So that's correct.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. Let me recalculate the vibrational E.

Given w = 4e14 rad/s.

Frequency nu = w/(2pi) = 4e14 / (6.2832) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

E_vibrational transition (n=0 → n=1) is h nu = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

So p_photon = E/c = 4.21e-20 / 3e8 = 1.403e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's the same as this calculation.

So why is this happening? Because maybe the rotational transition is not possible, or perhaps the model doesn't allow such a transition. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. But in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length is not fixed, so perhaps the rotational energy levels are not quantized as in the rigid rotor.

Wait, but the question states that the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps it's a combined model, and the allowed transitions involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, as the main contributor to the energy change when a photon is absorbed.

Wait, if the photon has to provide the energy for the next state, and the next state is the lowest possible energy, which could be a vibrational transition, then the photon's momentum would be 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, which would be the next state. So why is the answer matching the vibrational?

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state in terms of energy level, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So the "next state" is the one with the next higher energy, which could be either vibrational or rotational.

But the next state in energy would be the one with the smallest delta E. So if delta E_rot is smaller than delta E_vibr, then the rotational transition is the next.

But in that case, the calculated photon momentum would be 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the model expects the question to consider only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rigid rotor model, in which case the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_J = (J (J+1) hbar^2 )/(2I ), and the next state is J=1. So delta E_rot is 9.3e-23 J.

But again, that doesn't match any options.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as the sum of both rotational and vibrational contributions, and the next state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which could be either a change in J or n.

But in that case, the energy difference would be the minimum of delta E_rot and delta E_vibr. As delta E_rot is smaller, the photon's momentum would be based on delta E_rot.

But I don't see an option matching that.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, which is similar to the vibrational energy's photon momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the rotational energy because I forgot to account for the centrifugal distortion, but I don't think that would change the order of magnitude.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), and the next state is the first excited state, which is (n=1, J=0). So the energy difference would be the vibrational delta E.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because in terms of energy, the rotational transition would require less energy, so it would come before the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are ordered such that the first excited state is J=1, n=0, but the problem is that the rotational transition's energy is lower, so it's the first possible.

But if the question states that the molecule is switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, then the photon must supply the energy for the smallest delta E, which is the rotational.

Hmm. So I'm confused because the calculation with the rotational transition doesn't match any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me try again.

E_J for J=1 is (2) * (hbar^2/(2I)) )= (hbar^2)/(I).

hbar^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68.

I = mu * R².

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = 40/22 amu = 1.818 amu.

20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

I = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 *4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

So E_J = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 = approximately 9.3e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.3e-23 J, which gives p_photon = 9.3e-23 / 3e8 = 3.1e-31 Ns.

But options don't have this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the energy difference between the rotational levels and not considering the vibrational.

Wait, but in that case, the photon's energy is 9.3e-23 J, which gives 3.1e-31 N·s. None of the options are close.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total energy, which includes both rotational and vibrational. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the rotational part only, ignoring the vibrational. So the photon's momentum is based on the rotational delta E.

But again, the calculation leads to 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps the given options are in a different unit or I made a miscalculation. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s. My calculation for the vibrational transition gives 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the model expects that the next state is the vibrational one, not the rotational. But why would that be the case?

Maybe because the vibrational energy is quantized, and transitions are allowed only between certain states, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the molecule's energy in the context of the rigid rotor only, not the rotation-vibration model. But the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, perhaps the model combines both, and the energy levels are a sum of rotational and vibrational.

Wait, so the fundamental state is (n=0, J=0), and the next state could be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0), whichever has the lower energy. But as previously calculated, the energy delta for J=1 is smaller than for n=1.

So the photon should provide the energy for J=1 transition.

But again, the calculation leads to a momentum not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the model. Let me think again.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model treats the bond as having variable length, so the moment of inertia varies, and this affects the rotational energy levels. But I'm not sure how that changes the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the molecule is a rigid rotor and that the transition is purely rotational.

But the question says non-rigid, so that's probably not the case.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The correct answer is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So perhaps the model expects that the next state is a vibrational transition, despite the rotational being lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for E_J.

Wait, E_J = (J (J+1) hbar² )/(2I )

So for J=1, E_1 = (2) * hbar²/(2I) = hbar²/(I).

But perhaps I forgot to convert the units correctly.

Wait, let me re-calculate I.

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = (40)/(22) = 1.818 amu.

mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 2.99e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = mu R^2 = 2.99e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.99e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.196e-46 kg m².

hbar = 1.05457e-34 J s.

hbar² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_J = hbar² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.196e-46 = approx 9.3e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So I'm confident in the calculation, but it's not matching the options. So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next state with the next higher energy, which would be the vibrational state, but that would be incorrect because the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a typo, but that's beyond my control.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the energy difference. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the transition from J=0 to J=1 requires a photon of energy delta E = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = E_J=1.

But wait, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1)) hbar²/(2I).

So E_J=1 = (2) hbar²/(2I) )= hbar²/(I), which is the same as before.

So I'm not missing any factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as if it's the change in the molecule's momentum, but that doesn't make sense, because the photon's momentum is what causes the transition.

Wait, maybe I should think about the selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So the molecule can go from J=0 to J=1.

But perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the selection rules are different, but I don't think that changes the energy calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure why.

If delta E is 4.21e-20 J, then p_photon is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is not quantized as in the rigid rotor, or perhaps because the problem is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to the next vibrational state, which is the first possible state when considering only vibrational transitions.

But in that case, the rotational transition would have a lower energy. So perhaps the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational.

So the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vibr.

E_rot = (J (J+1) hbar² )/(2I )

E_vibr = (n + 1/2) h nu.

So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0.

The next possible state could be either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1). Which has a lower energy?

E1 = E_vibr (n=1) = (1 + 1/2) h nu = (3/2) h nu.

E2 = E_rot (J=1) = (1*2 hbar²)/(2I) )= (2 hbar²)/(2I) )= hbar²/I.

Which is smaller between E1 and E2?

E1 = (3/2) h nu = (3/2)*6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ (3/2) *4.21e-20 ≈ 6.316e-20 J.

E2 = 9.3e-23 J.

So E2 is much smaller. So the next state is (n=0, J=1), requiring a photon of 9.3e-23 J.

Which again, doesn't match any options.

But perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning to the next vibrational state, assuming that the rotational state is already at J=0, the lowest, so the next state is vibrational.

But that would be incorrect because the rotational transition requires less energy.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the only one matching my vibrational calculation is option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. So perhaps that's the intended answer.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (\( n = 0 \)) and the lowest rotational state (\( J = 0 \)).

3. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a **rotational transition** (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)) or a **vibrational transition** (\( n = 0 \to n = 1 \)).

### Rotational Energy Transition:
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_J = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}
\]
where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js} \) and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

1. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 2.99 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (2.99 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.196 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

3. **Energy Difference for \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)**:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.196 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.3 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.3 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
   \]
   This value does not match any of the given options.

---

### Vibrational Energy Transition:
The vibrational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu
\]
where \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \).

1. **Frequency**:
   \[
   \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
   \]

2. **Energy Difference for \( n = 0 \to n = 1 \)**:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibr}} = E_1 - E_0 = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:
   \[
   p_{\text{vibr}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibr}}}{c} = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]

---

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)) than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vibr}} \)). However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p_{\text{rot}} \)) does not match any of the given options. The vibrational transition momentum (\( p_{\text{vibr}} \)) matches **Option D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)).

Given the options, it appears the question expects the vibrational transition to be considered, even though the rotational transition has a smaller energy difference. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
