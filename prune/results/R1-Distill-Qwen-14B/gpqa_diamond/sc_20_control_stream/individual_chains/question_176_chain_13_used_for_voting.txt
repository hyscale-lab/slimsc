Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about measuring observables P and Q in a given state. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the state of the system at time t is a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—those are the components. So the state vector is probably a 3-dimensional vector because the matrices are 3x3. Let me write that down: the state vector |ψ> is [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). But the state vector isn't normalized. Hmm, but maybe the problem doesn't require normalization for the probabilities because the probabilities will take care of it. Or perhaps it's assumed to be normalized. I'm a bit confused here.

Next, the operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
    [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

And the operator Q is:

Q = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, -1]
]

The question is about measuring P first and then measuring Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, we measure P, and if we get 0, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, we measure Q on that new state.

So the approach is: first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Then, find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. Then, given that the state collapses to that eigenvector, find the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, but P's matrix looks a bit like a permutation matrix. Let me see. The diagonal elements are zero. Hmm. So P is a Hermitian matrix because the elements are real, so it's an observable.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

P - λ I is:
[
[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]
]

The determinant would be:

|P - λ I| = -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it another way. Alternatively, considering that P is a 3x3 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/sqrt(2) on the off-diagonal except for some positions.

Wait, looking at the matrix P, it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the structure of the matrix. The first row of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], so it's non-zero only in the second element. Similarly, the second row has non-zero elements in the first, second, and third positions. The third row is similar to the first.

Wait, perhaps the matrix has a pattern. Let me think about the symmetry. Maybe the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a spin-1 operator or something similar... Hmm, maybe not necessary. Let me try to find the eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation for P is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Expanding the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ] 

Wait, let me compute it correctly. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row.

The (1,1) element is -λ, the minor for that is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:
[
[-λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ]
]
Which is (λ^2 - (1/2)).

Then, the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the minor is the determinant of the matrix:
[
[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, -λ]
]
Which is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ/(sqrt(2)).

But since the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * minor. So that term is -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/(sqrt(2))) = (λ/(2)).

The (1,3) element is 0, so no contribution.

So the determinant is (-λ) * (λ^2 - 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/(sqrt(2))) * (-1)^(1+2) ?

Wait, perhaps I should better structure the expansion.

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So for our P - λ I matrix:

a = -λ, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = 0
d = 1/sqrt(2), e = -λ, f = 1/sqrt(2)
g = 0, h = 1/sqrt(2), i = -λ

So determinant = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

Which becomes:

(-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Compute each term:

First term: (-λ)[(λ^2) - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) - 0 ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ/2 )

Third term is 0.

So determinant is (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) + (λ/2).

Expanding that:

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ.

Set this equal to zero:

-λ^3 + λ = 0
λ(-λ^2 + 1) = 0
So λ = 0, λ^2 = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, so P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Hmm, that's interesting. So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the operator's matrix for P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable, which aligns with having real eigenvalues.

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors for P, specifically for the eigenvalue 0 because the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P.

So to find the eigenvectors, we need to solve (P - 0 I)|v> = 0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: (0 - 0)v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (0 - 0) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + (0 - 0)v3 = 0 → same as row 1, so v2 must be 0.

So from row 1: v2=0.

From row 2: v1 = -v3.

v3 is a free variable.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1; 0; v3] = v3 [ -1; 0; 1 ].

So the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1). Let me check that.

Wait, if I plug this into P, does it equal 0?

P * [ -1; 0; 1 ].

Compute each component:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(1) = 0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 +1)/sqrt(2) = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(1) = 0.

So yes, it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

But wait, I thought eigenvectors can be scaled. So any multiple of (-1,0,1) is an eigenvector for P=0.

Thus, the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (-1,0,1). So the eigenvector is proportional to this.

Wait, but the state we have is [-1; 2;1]. We need to compute the inner product between this state and the eigenvector of P=0 to find the probability.

Wait, but the state vector is not normalized. So first, I should normalize it.

The original state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2;1].

Alternatively, since the probabilities depend on the square of the amplitude, perhaps I can proceed without normalizing, but I think it's better to proceed with the normalized state.

So, the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |0> = [ -1; 0; 1 ].

We can normalize |0> as well because it's an eigenvector. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is |0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].

So the amplitude is the inner product of |ψ> and |0>, right?

Wait, |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Compute the inner product:

⟨0 | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] · (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(12))) [ 1 + 0 + 1 ]

= (2)/(sqrt(12)) )

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but the question says that after measuring P=0, we then measure Q and want the probability that Q=-1.

So now the state collapses to |0>, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ] up to normalization. But wait, the normalized |0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].

When we measure Q, which has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1, as per its diagonal matrix.

So the operator Q's eigenstates are along the standard basis vectors.

Because Q is diagonal, its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

- For eigenvalue 1: [1;0;0]

- For eigenvalue 0: [0;1;0]

- For eigenvalue -1: [0;0;1]

So to find the probability of getting Q=-1, we compute the inner product between the state |0> (after P=0 measurement) and the eigenvector | -1> = [0;0;1].

But let's compute it properly.

The state after P=0 is |0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ]

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is | -1 ⟩ = [0;0;1 ]

So the amplitude is ⟨ -1 | 0 ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ 0, 0, 1 ] · [ -1; 0; 1 ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 +1*1 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) *1.

So the probability is |1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait. No, because the state |0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ], so the third component is 1/sqrt(2). The | -1> state is [0;0;1]. So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * 1. So the square is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. So the probability to get Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait a minute. So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities?

No, because the state collapses after the first measurement. So the probability is (probability P=0) multiplied by (probability Q=-1 given P=0).

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait, am I making a mistake here? Because the state after P=0 is |0>, which is a normalized vector. Then, when measuring Q, the probability for each outcome is based on the inner product squared.

So, in |0>, the third component is 1/sqrt(2). So the probability of Q=-1 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but let me double-check everything.

First, the state vector is given as [-1;2;1], which has a norm squared of 6. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) times that vector.

The eigenvector for P=0 is [ -1;0;1], which when normalized is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1;0;1 ].

The inner product between the state and |0> is (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 +1*1 ] =  (1/sqrt(12)) * (1 + 0 +1) )= 2/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12)/6 = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3). So the probability is 1/3.

Then, after measuring P=0, the state is |0> = [ -1;0;1 ] / sqrt(2).

When measuring Q, which has eigenvectors [1;0;0], [0;1;0], [0;0;1] for eigenvalues 1,0,-1.

The inner product between |0> and | -1> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 +1*(1) )) = (1/sqrt(2)) * 1. So the square is 1/2.

So the probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps because Q and P don't necessarily commute, the order of measurements matters. But in this case, the first measurement is P, so the state is projected onto P's eigenstates, and Q is measured on that state.

So I think my earlier conclusion is correct.

The state of the system is given as the column vector \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which has a norm squared of \( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \). Thus, the normalized state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 1, 0, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is \( |0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which normalizes to \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |0\rangle \):

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + 1(1) \right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, the probability of \( P = 0 \) is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle 0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors \( |1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively. The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product between \( |0\rangle \) and \( |-1\rangle \):

\[
\langle -1 | 0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1.
\]

Thus, the probability of \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \langle -1 | 0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
