Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the GFP isn't showing up in the mice. Let me break it down step by step.

So the setup is that someone created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive, so that part should be expressed. Then, between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Oh, right, loxP sites are used for recombination. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the gene downstream to be expressed. 

Similarly, the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein in the same mRNA as the ligand, but under a different initiation context. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. Then, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, I think it's used for different Cre variants or maybe for specific recombination under certain conditions. 

So the vector is set up such that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So ligand and mCherry are co-expressed from the same transcript, but only when the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed from another transcript, again when the stop is removed.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. After transfection, they ran a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin loading, which means their loading controls are working. So the proteins are being expressed and detected, presumably.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and Cre is under the control of SOX10, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green because the receptor is fused to eGFP. But no green signal. Why?

So the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression in the mouse? They would still express the proteins, just not autocrine. Not sure how this would cause no GFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it might not be trafficked to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the Western blot would show the protein is expressed, right? Because the blot would detect the presence regardless of localization. Unless the GFP isn't being made. Wait, but the Western blot is testing for the overexpressed proteins, not the GFP. Hmm. Maybe in the Western blot, they're using antibodies against the ligand and receptor. So if the GFP is not expressed, but the receptor is, the blot would detect it. But the question says the blot showed signals proportional to actin, suggesting that the proteins were expressed. So maybe the GFP isn't expressed but the receptor is. But the Western blot is about the overexpressed proteins, which in this case are the ligand and the receptor. So perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed, but the receptor is. So if the stop cassette wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the presence of Cre should excise the cassettes.

Wait, but the stop cassette for the ligand is loxP and for the receptor is lox2272. Cre is the recombinase that typically acts on loxP sites. Lox2272 is a mutant lox site that Cre can still act on, but sometimes requires a longer time or higher expression. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant that's less efficiently recombined by Cre compared to loxP. So in the vector, the ligand is under a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is under a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So when Cre is introduced, it should remove the stop cassettes. But if the Cre is active, it would excise both? Or maybe the ligand's cassette is loxP and the receptor's is lox2272. So if the Cre is active, it should excise both. But if the Cre isn't active in the right cells, then the stops remain, and the constructs aren't expressed.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse where Cre is under the control of SOX10, so Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like in the peripheral nervous system, maybe? So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in those cells, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes and allowing expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the experiment, when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Let's think about the bicistronic construct. The construct is designed so that the ligand is first, with the stop cassette, then mCherry. The receptor is downstream with an IRES, then the stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. The vector is bicistronic, so it's one transcript. The first ORF is the ligand, under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP). Then comes the IRES, which drives the second ORF, the receptor. That ORF is followed by a lox2272 stop cassette.

So the expression would be: in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry because the stop is in between, but the stop is under a loxP cassette. The receptor would be expressed as a fusion with eGFP only if the lox2272 stop is excised. Wait, noâ€”no, the ligand's stop is loxP. So the first ORF is ligand, then the stop, then mCherry? Or is the ligand ORF followed by a stop cassette, then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, then another stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait the description says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry; the receptor is at 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a stop cassette (lox2272). So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop -> mCherry. Then IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop -> eGFP.

Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the structure is: CBA promoter, ligand ORF, loxP stop, mCherry. Then, IRES, receptor ORF, lox2272 stop, eGFP.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the arrangement wrong. The ligand is at 5', followed by a stop cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor, then another stop, then eGFP.

So the vector is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP stop -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop -> eGFP.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. It's a bicistronic vector, so two ORFs in one transcript. The first ORF is the ligand, under the CBA promoter. After the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP). Then comes the IRES, which allows a second ORF to be read. The second ORF is the receptor, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) and then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, it cuts the loxP and lox2272 sites. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is under SOX10, so it's active in neural crest cells, which is where the ligand and receptor are normally expressed. 

But the GFP isn't showing up. Why? Let's think about the possible issues.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then during translation, the receptor wouldn't be expressed because the stop codon is in the way. But if the stop was excised, then the receptor would be expressed. So if the lox2272 wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why?

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. Cre can recognize both, but perhaps lox2272 requires a different Cre or has lower efficiency. I think that lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but requires more time or higher expression levels. So maybe in this case, the lox2272 cassette wasn't excised because Cre wasn't active enough or wasn't expressed in the cells. Or perhaps the construct isn't properly recombined.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't driving expression of the receptor-eGFP. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But IRES should allow internal initiation, so maybe that's not it.

In the Western blot, they see signals for the overexpressed proteins. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed. But in the mice, when they look for eGFP, there's no signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. 

Wait, but the Western blot was done on primary astrocytes transfected with the plasmid. So that's a different expression system. They saw that the proteins are expressed. But in the transgenic mice, perhaps the eGFP isn't getting expressed.

So, when they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes. But maybe the Cre isn't working, or the excision isn't happening.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background, then crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the presence of Cre would excise the stops, but perhaps there's an issue with the lox sites.

Another possibility is that the IRES is not functioning properly, but I'm not certain.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the reading frame is messed up. Wait, the construct is designed so that the receptor is in frame with eGFP. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Alternatively, if there's a frameshift, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

But why would the stop cassette not being excised matter? Because without excision, the stop codon would prevent the expression of eGFP. So if the lox2272 sites are not recombined, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So in the confocal, you wouldn't see the green signal.

But why isn't the Cre excising the lox2272 sites?

Well, Cre is usually active under the control of the SOX10 promoter in neural crest cells. Maybe the construct isn't properly set up to be excised in those cells. Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 variant isn't efficiently recombined by Cre. So perhaps the lox2272 site isn't being cut, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. I think lox sites have specific directions, so if they're in the wrong orientation, Cre won't excise them. So for a stop cassette, the lox sites are in a certain direction, so that when Cre cuts, the stop is removed. If the sites are in the wrong orientation, the stop remains.

Wait, the question says that between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the loxP sites flank the stop. So it's loxP, then stop, then loxP. Similarly for the receptor, it's lox2272, stop, lox2272.

When Cre is present, it should cut the lox sites and delete the stop, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

So if the lox2272 sites are in the correct orientation, the stop cassette would be excised, and the eGFP would be expressed. But if the sites are in the wrong orientation, the stop remains.

Another possibility is that the lox sites weren't properly inserted. But the question doesn't mention any issues with the construct's design, so perhaps it's more about the Cre activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. But the presence of the stop cassette in the way would prevent that.

Hmm, but the Western blot was done on primary astrocytes transfected with the vector. They saw the proteins, so the construct works in that cell type. But in the mouse, the expression isn't happening.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is in the genome, so the expression would depend on the presence of Cre to remove the stops. So if the Cre isn't active, the stops remain, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which should be expressed in the neural crest cells.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which is in the wild-type background. They cross to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and one copy of SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, Cre should be expressed, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes.

But perhaps the construct isn't efficiently recombined in the mouse. Maybe the lox2272 sites aren't being cut as efficiently as loxP sites. I remember that lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but requires a longer time or higher expression levels. If the Cre isn't active enough or isn't expressed in sufficient amounts in the cells, the lox2272 sites might not be excised, leaving the stop in place and preventing eGFP expression.

So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised, so the receptor and eGFP aren't co-expressed. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at the options, option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. But that seems like a problem with the construct design, not with the Cre excision. Alternatively, if the stop cassette remains, the eGFP isn't even initiated.

Wait another thought: if the stop cassette remains, the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed at all because the stop codon is in the way. So the Western blot would show the receptor if it's expressed, but if the stop remains, the receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, implying that the proteins are expressed. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Alternatively, the Western blot might have detected the ligand and receptor, but not eGFP. But since the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, maybe the expression is different.

Wait, the setup says in the mouse, they look for the eGFP. But the construct's eGFP is only expressed when the stop is excised. If the stop remains, eGFP isn't expressed. So if the Cre isn't working, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why isn't Cre working? Well, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't being recognized. Or the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot indicated that the ligand and receptor are expressed, so probably the IRES is working.

Hmm, another thought: the stop cassette for the receptor is using lox2272, which is a variant. The Cre might not be able to efficiently excise this site, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason for no GFP is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the stop is still present, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But that would be a construct design issue. Another possibility is that the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, meaning the stop isn't excised, so no eGFP.

But the options don't directly address the lox sites. Option D is about the frame, which would relate to the presence of the stop.

Wait, another angle. The construct is designed so that when the stop is excised, the receptor is in frame with eGFP, allowing their co-expression. If the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed. So if the Cre isn't excising the lox2272 sites, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why isn't Cre excising them? Because the lox2272 variant might not be as efficiently cut by Cre as loxP. So perhaps under the conditions in the mouse, the Cre isn't active enough to cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains.

But the question is asking for the most likely reason. The options are A to D. 

Option B says the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, perhaps it's not reaching the cell surface, so the GFP isn't visible. But Western blot would still show the protein is present. However, if the stop is present, the GFP isn't made, so the Western blot wouldn't detect it either. But the question says that the Western blot on transfected cells worked, indicating that the construct works when expressed in vitro, but not in the transgenic mice.

Wait, but the construct in the mouse is in the genome. If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't made, so nothing shows up under the confocal.

So why isn't the stop excised? The most likely option is that the Cre isn't excising the lox2272 sites. But the options don't directly address this. Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would imply that even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor, leading to no expression. But that's more about construct design.

Wait, another point: the stop cassettes are in the correct reading frame? If the lox sites are properly recombined, the stop is removed, and the downstream sequences (mCherry or eGFP) are in frame with the upstream ORF. So if the stop isn't excised, the downstream isn't expressed. If the stop is excised but the frame is wrong, the fusion protein would be out of frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

But the Western blot would still detect the receptor, right? Because the stop is only between the ORF and the fluorescent protein.

Wait, no. The ligand is fused to mCherry, so the stop is between ligand and mCherry. The Receptor is fused to eGFP, with a stop between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't excised, the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF, and the receptor and eGFP are their own ORF. So the presence of the stop just affects whether the fluorescent protein is expressed. The ligand and receptor themselves are expressed regardless, as their ORFs are before the stops.

Wait, but the Western blot is detecting the overexpressed proteins. So if the stops are in place, the ligand and receptor are expressed as their own proteins, but the mCherry and eGFP aren't. So the Western blot would show the ligand and receptor, but not the fluorescent proteins.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal. But the Western blot in the initial experiment (on astrocytes) would have shown the ligand and receptor, which they did. So in the mouse, the same should hold: ligand and receptor are expressed, but not the fluorescent proteins. But why would the eGFP not be expressed?

Because the lox2272 sites aren't recombined, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression. So the most likely reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, looking at the options, the only one that relates to this is option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But wait, if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't even expressed. So maybe the stops are still there.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. But the IRES should drive internal initiation, so the receptor should be expressed if the stop is removed.

Wait, another thought. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, so the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under the IRES, so it's expressed as a separate ORF. But if the stop cassettes aren't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is expressed as its own ORF. So the Western blot would show the receptor being expressed, but not the eGFP.

But in the mouse, they look for eGFP, which isn't present because the stop isn't excised. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So the options are:

A) Paracrine relationship. Unrelated to expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Unlikely, because Western blot would detect the protein.

C) Missing enhancer. But the CBA promoter is strong.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop remains, they're not even expressed.

Wait, but if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, so D isn't the issue. The issue is that the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why isn't the stop removed?

Ah, perhaps the construct wasn't properly recombined. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells, but that's about the SOX10-Cre mice.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't compatible with Cre. So Cre isn't cutting them.

But the options don't have that. So the closest option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the construct design, not the recombination. So perhaps the issue is that the stop wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address that; the best fit is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the question: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion proteins. But if the lox2272 isn't recombined, the eGFP isn't expressed.

The reason why no green is observed is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 sites weren't recombined. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, which says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that would be a problem only if the stop was excised but the frame is wrong. But if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is a different issue.

Another angle: perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because the stop remains. So the reason is that the stop isn't excised, which is due to the lox2272 not being recombined. But the options don't address this, so we have to pick the best possible option.

The other options: A says paracrine. If it were paracrine, the proteins would still be expressed, just not acting on the same cell. But the fluorescence wouldn't necessarily be affected unless it's on the cell surface. But the Western blot shows expression, so it's not an issue of expression.

B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. But that would affect localization, but the Western blot would still detect the protein. So the blot would show the receptor, but the GFP wouldn't be visible. But in the mouse, the Western blot isn't done; the confocal is used. So if the protein is made but stuck in the Golgi, the GFP wouldn't fluoresce. But again, the Western blot on transfected cells worked, so the construct is functional.

So the likely reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly relate, so the best fit is D, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent protein fusions (mCherry and eGFP) flanking stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272). The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The construct was introduced into mice, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to excise the stop cassettes, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy. The goal is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Construct and Experimental Setup:
1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry.
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP.
   - The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, allowing separate translation of the two ORFs.

2. **Function of Cre**:
   - Cre recombinase excises the stop cassettes, enabling expression of the fluorescent protein fusions (mCherry and eGFP).
   - LoxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for Cre, but lox2272 is a variant that may require more efficient or prolonged Cre activity for excision.

3. **Mouse Model and Expression**:
   - The construct is homozygous in a wild-type background and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10-Cre ensures Cre expression in neural crest-derived cells, where the ligand and receptor are normally expressed.
   - If the stop cassettes are excised, the receptor-eGFP fusion should be expressed and visible under confocal microscopy.

4. **Observations**:
   - Western blot on transfected astrocytes showed signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the ligand and receptor are expressed.
   - No green signal was observed in the confocal microscopy of the transgenic mice, suggesting that eGFP is not expressed.

### Evaluation of the Options:
- **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
  This refers to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor, but it does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The lack of fluorescence is unrelated to the paracrine relationship. **Not the correct answer.**

- **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
  If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would affect localization but not necessarily its expression. The Western blot would still detect the receptor, and the issue would not specifically prevent eGFP expression. **Not the correct answer.**

- **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
  The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no evidence that an enhancer is missing, and the Western blot confirms that the ligand and receptor are expressed. **Not the correct answer.**

- **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
  If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion protein. However, this would only occur if the stop cassette had been excised but the reading frames were misaligned. The more likely explanation is that the stop cassette (lox2272) was not excised, preventing eGFP expression entirely. While this option partially addresses the issue, it does not fully explain why the stop cassette was not excised. **Not the correct answer.**

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of green signal is that the lox2272 stop cassette was not excised, preventing eGFP expression. However, none of the options explicitly address this issue. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression, even though the primary issue lies in the failure of Cre to excise the lox2272 cassette.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the GFP isn't showing up in the mice. Let me break it down step by step.

So the setup is that someone created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive, so that part should be expressed. Then, between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Oh, right, loxP sites are used for recombination. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the gene downstream to be expressed. 

Similarly, the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein in the same mRNA as the ligand, but under a different initiation context. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. Then, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, I think it's used for different Cre variants or maybe for specific recombination under certain conditions. 

So the vector is set up such that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So ligand and mCherry are co-expressed from the same transcript, but only when the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed from another transcript, again when the stop is removed.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. After transfection, they ran a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin loading, which means their loading controls are working. So the proteins are being expressed and detected, presumably.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and Cre is under the control of SOX10, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green because the receptor is fused to eGFP. But no green signal. Why?

So the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression in the mouse? They would still express the proteins, just not autocrine. Not sure how this would cause no GFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it might not be trafficked to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the Western blot would show the protein is expressed, right? Because the blot would detect the presence regardless of localization. Unless the GFP isn't being made. Wait, but the Western blot is testing for the overexpressed proteins, not the GFP. Hmm. Maybe in the Western blot, they're using antibodies against the ligand and receptor. So if the GFP is not expressed, but the receptor is, the blot would detect it. But the question says the blot showed signals proportional to actin, suggesting that the proteins were expressed. So maybe the GFP isn't expressed but the receptor is. But the Western blot is about the overexpressed proteins, which in this case are the ligand and the receptor. So perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed, but the receptor is. So if the stop cassette wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the presence of Cre should excise the cassettes.

Wait, but the stop cassette for the ligand is loxP and for the receptor is lox2272. Cre is the recombinase that typically acts on loxP sites. Lox2272 is a mutant lox site that Cre can still act on, but sometimes requires a longer time or higher expression. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant that's less efficiently recombined by Cre compared to loxP. So in the vector, the ligand is under a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is under a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So when Cre is introduced, it should remove the stop cassettes. But if the Cre is active, it would excise both? Or maybe the ligand's cassette is loxP and the receptor's is lox2272. So if the Cre is active, it should excise both. But if the Cre isn't active in the right cells, then the stops remain, and the constructs aren't expressed.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse where Cre is under the control of SOX10, so Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like in the peripheral nervous system, maybe? So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in those cells, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes and allowing expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the experiment, when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Let's think about the bicistronic construct. The construct is designed so that the ligand is first, with the stop cassette, then mCherry. The receptor is downstream with an IRES, then the stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. The vector is bicistronic, so it's one transcript. The first ORF is the ligand, under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP). Then comes the IRES, which drives the second ORF, the receptor. That ORF is followed by a lox2272 stop cassette.

So the expression would be: in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry because the stop is in between, but the stop is under a loxP cassette. The receptor would be expressed as a fusion with eGFP only if the lox2272 stop is excised. Wait, noâ€”no, the ligand's stop is loxP. So the first ORF is ligand, then the stop, then mCherry? Or is the ligand ORF followed by a stop cassette, then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, then another stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait the description says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry; the receptor is at 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a stop cassette (lox2272). So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop -> mCherry. Then IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop -> eGFP.

Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the structure is: CBA promoter, ligand ORF, loxP stop, mCherry. Then, IRES, receptor ORF, lox2272 stop, eGFP.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the arrangement wrong. The ligand is at 5', followed by a stop cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor, then another stop, then eGFP.

So the vector is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP stop -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop -> eGFP.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again. It's a bicistronic vector, so two ORFs in one transcript. The first ORF is the ligand, under the CBA promoter. After the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP). Then comes the IRES, which allows a second ORF to be read. The second ORF is the receptor, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) and then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, it cuts the loxP and lox2272 sites. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is under SOX10, so it's active in neural crest cells, which is where the ligand and receptor are normally expressed. 

But the GFP isn't showing up. Why? Let's think about the possible issues.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then during translation, the receptor wouldn't be expressed because the stop codon is in the way. But if the stop was excised, then the receptor would be expressed. So if the lox2272 wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why?

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. Cre can recognize both, but perhaps lox2272 requires a different Cre or has lower efficiency. I think that lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but requires more time or higher expression levels. So maybe in this case, the lox2272 cassette wasn't excised because Cre wasn't active enough or wasn't expressed in the cells. Or perhaps the construct isn't properly recombined.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't driving expression of the receptor-eGFP. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But IRES should allow internal initiation, so maybe that's not it.

In the Western blot, they see signals for the overexpressed proteins. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed. But in the mice, when they look for eGFP, there's no signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. 

Wait, but the Western blot was done on primary astrocytes transfected with the plasmid. So that's a different expression system. They saw that the proteins are expressed. But in the transgenic mice, perhaps the eGFP isn't getting expressed.

So, when they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes. But maybe the Cre isn't working, or the excision isn't happening.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background, then crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the presence of Cre would excise the stops, but perhaps there's an issue with the lox sites.

Another possibility is that the IRES is not functioning properly, but I'm not certain.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the reading frame is messed up. Wait, the construct is designed so that the receptor is in frame with eGFP. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Alternatively, if there's a frameshift, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

But why would the stop cassette not being excised matter? Because without excision, the stop codon would prevent the expression of eGFP. So if the lox2272 sites are not recombined, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So in the confocal, you wouldn't see the green signal.

But why isn't the Cre excising the lox2272 sites?

Well, Cre is usually active under the control of the SOX10 promoter in neural crest cells. Maybe the construct isn't properly set up to be excised in those cells. Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 variant isn't efficiently recombined by Cre. So perhaps the lox2272 site isn't being cut, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. I think lox sites have specific directions, so if they're in the wrong orientation, Cre won't excise them. So for a stop cassette, the lox sites are in a certain direction, so that when Cre cuts, the stop is removed. If the sites are in the wrong orientation, the stop remains.

Wait, the question says that between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the loxP sites flank the stop. So it's loxP, then stop, then loxP. Similarly for the receptor, it's lox2272, stop, lox2272.

When Cre is present, it should cut the lox sites and delete the stop, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

So if the lox2272 sites are in the correct orientation, the stop cassette would be excised, and the eGFP would be expressed. But if the sites are in the wrong orientation, the stop remains.

Another possibility is that the lox sites weren't properly inserted. But the question doesn't mention any issues with the construct's design, so perhaps it's more about the Cre activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. But the presence of the stop cassette in the way would prevent that.

Hmm, but the Western blot was done on primary astrocytes transfected with the vector. They saw the proteins, so the construct works in that cell type. But in the mouse, the expression isn't happening.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is in the genome, so the expression would depend on the presence of Cre to remove the stops. So if the Cre isn't active, the stops remain, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which should be expressed in the neural crest cells.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which is in the wild-type background. They cross to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and one copy of SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, Cre should be expressed, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes.

But perhaps the construct isn't efficiently recombined in the mouse. Maybe the lox2272 sites aren't being cut as efficiently as loxP sites. I remember that lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but requires a longer time or higher expression levels. If the Cre isn't active enough or isn't expressed in sufficient amounts in the cells, the lox2272 sites might not be excised, leaving the stop in place and preventing eGFP expression.

So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised, so the receptor and eGFP aren't co-expressed. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at the options, option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. But that seems like a problem with the construct design, not with the Cre excision. Alternatively, if the stop cassette remains, the eGFP isn't even initiated.

Wait another thought: if the stop cassette remains, the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed at all because the stop codon is in the way. So the Western blot would show the receptor if it's expressed, but if the stop remains, the receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, implying that the proteins are expressed. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Alternatively, the Western blot might have detected the ligand and receptor, but not eGFP. But since the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, maybe the expression is different.

Wait, the setup says in the mouse, they look for the eGFP. But the construct's eGFP is only expressed when the stop is excised. If the stop remains, eGFP isn't expressed. So if the Cre isn't working, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why isn't Cre working? Well, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't being recognized. Or the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot indicated that the ligand and receptor are expressed, so probably the IRES is working.

Hmm, another thought: the stop cassette for the receptor is using lox2272, which is a variant. The Cre might not be able to efficiently excise this site, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason for no GFP is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the stop is still present, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But that would be a construct design issue. Another possibility is that the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, meaning the stop isn't excised, so no eGFP.

But the options don't directly address the lox sites. Option D is about the frame, which would relate to the presence of the stop.

Wait, another angle. The construct is designed so that when the stop is excised, the receptor is in frame with eGFP, allowing their co-expression. If the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed. So if the Cre isn't excising the lox2272 sites, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why isn't Cre excising them? Because the lox2272 variant might not be as efficiently cut by Cre as loxP. So perhaps under the conditions in the mouse, the Cre isn't active enough to cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains.

But the question is asking for the most likely reason. The options are A to D. 

Option B says the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, perhaps it's not reaching the cell surface, so the GFP isn't visible. But Western blot would still show the protein is present. However, if the stop is present, the GFP isn't made, so the Western blot wouldn't detect it either. But the question says that the Western blot on transfected cells worked, indicating that the construct works when expressed in vitro, but not in the transgenic mice.

Wait, but the construct in the mouse is in the genome. If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't made, so nothing shows up under the confocal.

So why isn't the stop excised? The most likely option is that the Cre isn't excising the lox2272 sites. But the options don't directly address this. Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would imply that even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor, leading to no expression. But that's more about construct design.

Wait, another point: the stop cassettes are in the correct reading frame? If the lox sites are properly recombined, the stop is removed, and the downstream sequences (mCherry or eGFP) are in frame with the upstream ORF. So if the stop isn't excised, the downstream isn't expressed. If the stop is excised but the frame is wrong, the fusion protein would be out of frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

But the Western blot would still detect the receptor, right? Because the stop is only between the ORF and the fluorescent protein.

Wait, no. The ligand is fused to mCherry, so the stop is between ligand and mCherry. The Receptor is fused to eGFP, with a stop between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't excised, the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF, and the receptor and eGFP are their own ORF. So the presence of the stop just affects whether the fluorescent protein is expressed. The ligand and receptor themselves are expressed regardless, as their ORFs are before the stops.

Wait, but the Western blot is detecting the overexpressed proteins. So if the stops are in place, the ligand and receptor are expressed as their own proteins, but the mCherry and eGFP aren't. So the Western blot would show the ligand and receptor, but not the fluorescent proteins.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal. But the Western blot in the initial experiment (on astrocytes) would have shown the ligand and receptor, which they did. So in the mouse, the same should hold: ligand and receptor are expressed, but not the fluorescent proteins. But why would the eGFP not be expressed?

Because the lox2272 sites aren't recombined, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression. So the most likely reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, looking at the options, the only one that relates to this is option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But wait, if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't even expressed. So maybe the stops are still there.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. But the IRES should drive internal initiation, so the receptor should be expressed if the stop is removed.

Wait, another thought. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, so the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under the IRES, so it's expressed as a separate ORF. But if the stop cassettes aren't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is expressed as its own ORF. So the Western blot would show the receptor being expressed, but not the eGFP.

But in the mouse, they look for eGFP, which isn't present because the stop isn't excised. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So the options are:

A) Paracrine relationship. Unrelated to expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Unlikely, because Western blot would detect the protein.

C) Missing enhancer. But the CBA promoter is strong.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop remains, they're not even expressed.

Wait, but if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, so D isn't the issue. The issue is that the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why isn't the stop removed?

Ah, perhaps the construct wasn't properly recombined. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells, but that's about the SOX10-Cre mice.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't compatible with Cre. So Cre isn't cutting them.

But the options don't have that. So the closest option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the construct design, not the recombination. So perhaps the issue is that the stop wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address that; the best fit is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the question: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion proteins. But if the lox2272 isn't recombined, the eGFP isn't expressed.

The reason why no green is observed is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 sites weren't recombined. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, which says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that would be a problem only if the stop was excised but the frame is wrong. But if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is a different issue.

Another angle: perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because the stop remains. So the reason is that the stop isn't excised, which is due to the lox2272 not being recombined. But the options don't address this, so we have to pick the best possible option.

The other options: A says paracrine. If it were paracrine, the proteins would still be expressed, just not acting on the same cell. But the fluorescence wouldn't necessarily be affected unless it's on the cell surface. But the Western blot shows expression, so it's not an issue of expression.

B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. But that would affect localization, but the Western blot would still detect the protein. So the blot would show the receptor, but the GFP wouldn't be visible. But in the mouse, the Western blot isn't done; the confocal is used. So if the protein is made but stuck in the Golgi, the GFP wouldn't fluoresce. But again, the Western blot on transfected cells worked, so the construct is functional.

So the likely reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly relate, so the best fit is D, but I'm not entirely confident.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent protein fusions (mCherry and eGFP) flanking stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272). The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The construct was introduced into mice, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to excise the stop cassettes, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy. The goal is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Construct and Experimental Setup:
1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry.
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP.
   - The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, allowing separate translation of the two ORFs.

2. **Function of Cre**:
   - Cre recombinase excises the stop cassettes, enabling expression of the fluorescent protein fusions (mCherry and eGFP).
   - LoxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for Cre, but lox2272 is a variant that may require more efficient or prolonged Cre activity for excision.

3. **Mouse Model and Expression**:
   - The construct is homozygous in a wild-type background and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10-Cre ensures Cre expression in neural crest-derived cells, where the ligand and receptor are normally expressed.
   - If the stop cassettes are excised, the receptor-eGFP fusion should be expressed and visible under confocal microscopy.

4. **Observations**:
   - Western blot on transfected astrocytes showed signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the ligand and receptor are expressed.
   - No green signal was observed in the confocal microscopy of the transgenic mice, suggesting that eGFP is not expressed.

### Evaluation of the Options:
- **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
  This refers to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor, but it does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The lack of fluorescence is unrelated to the paracrine relationship. **Not the correct answer.**

- **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
  If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would affect localization but not necessarily its expression. The Western blot would still detect the receptor, and the issue would not specifically prevent eGFP expression. **Not the correct answer.**

- **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
  The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no evidence that an enhancer is missing, and the Western blot confirms that the ligand and receptor are expressed. **Not the correct answer.**

- **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
  If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion protein. However, this would only occur if the stop cassette had been excised but the reading frames were misaligned. The more likely explanation is that the stop cassette (lox2272) was not excised, preventing eGFP expression entirely. While this option partially addresses the issue, it does not fully explain why the stop cassette was not excised. **Not the correct answer.**

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of green signal is that the lox2272 stop cassette was not excised, preventing eGFP expression. However, none of the options explicitly address this issue. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression, even though the primary issue lies in the failure of Cre to excise the lox2272 cassette.

**Answer: D**
