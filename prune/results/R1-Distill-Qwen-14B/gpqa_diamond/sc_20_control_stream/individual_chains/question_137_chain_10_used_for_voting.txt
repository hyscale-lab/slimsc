Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator, right? And a synchrocyclotron is a special kind. The question is about how many revolutions a proton makes after being accelerated.

Alright, the problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It goes through two accelerations to reach 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Synchrocyclotrons use an oscillating electric field to accelerate particles, and the frequency of this field is adjusted to match the particle's changing frequency as it gains energy. Oh right, because as the particle's speed increases, its cyclotron frequency decreases. So the oscillator's frequency ν(α) must change with the particles' momentum to keep them in sync.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν(α) t + Φ0). My notes say that the voltage alternates, so the particles are accelerated each time the voltage is in the right phase. The phase Φ0 here is π/4, which is 45 degrees. I'm not sure how that plays into the number of revolutions, though.

The proton starts at rest (or nearly so), and after two accelerations, its kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or does it go through multiple cycles? Maybe each half-cycle provides an acceleration. Oh, wait, in cyclotrons, each time the electric field reverses, the particles get a kick. But I'm not sure how that translates to the total energy gained.

I think the main idea is that each time the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron, it gets a little more energy. So the number of revolutions needed to reach the desired energy would depend on the voltage and the energy per revolution.

Wait, the kinetic energy gained per revolution is related to the voltage. I remember that the energy gained per revolution in an accelerator is approximately eU0, where e is the charge of the proton and U0 is the peak voltage. But wait, in a cyclotron, the effective accelerating voltage is the peak voltage multiplied by sin(theta), maybe, where theta is the phase angle. Oh, because the voltage is applied sinusoidally, so the average voltage might matter.

Wait, but since the initial kinetic energy is negligible, we can approximate T ≈ e U0 * number of revolutions. Or wait, is it e U0 per revolution? Or is it e U0 * something like the phase factor?

Wait, let me think again. The energy gained per revolution in a cyclotron is e U0, assuming the voltage is applied each time the particle passes through the gap. Since the voltage is alternating, the particles are accelerated every half-cycle, so each full cycle (one revolution) gives them energy e U0. But wait, the initial phase is π/4, so maybe that affects the first acceleration. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the energy gained per revolution is e U0. So the total energy is e U0 multiplied by the number of revolutions N. So N ≈ T / (e U0).

Wait, the kinetic energy T is given as 950 MeV. So T = e U0 * N. Let's plug in the numbers.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs. U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So e U0 is (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = about 3.044e-15 J. Wait, but 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 190,000 eV is 190 keV? Wait, wait, no: U0 is 190 kV, so e U0 is 190,000 eV * e * V? No, wait, the energy is e multiplied by the voltage. So yeah, e * U0 is 190 kV * e, which is 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. So each revolution gives 190 keV.

Wait, but the total energy is 950 MeV. Oh, wait, 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. So if each revolution gives 190 keV, the number of revolutions N is 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000 revolutions. But wait, the options are 1864, 5300, 3536, 2500. So 5000 is close to option B, which is 5300. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. I think in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage changes as the proton gains energy. Because the cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field and the mass and charge of the particle. As the proton's speed increases, the radius of its orbit increases, and the frequency decreases. So the accelerating voltage's frequency ν(α) is adjusted to match the proton's changing frequency.

But how does that affect the number of revolutions? Maybe the actual number of revolutions is higher because the time taken for each revolution decreases as the proton's speed increases. Wait, no, because the voltage is adjusted so that each time the proton comes into the gap, the voltage is at the right phase. So the timing is matched, but the number of revolutions needed to reach a certain energy is still based on the energy gained per revolution.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the particles spiral outwards, and each time they cross the gap, they get a kick. The number of revolutions is the number of times they go around the ring before exiting. But the energy per revolution is the same in a conventional cyclotron because the magnetic field is constant. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particles gain energy, allowing them to reach higher energies. Hmm, but in this problem, perhaps the magnetic field is kept constant, and the frequency of the accelerating voltage is adjusted to match the proton's cyclotron frequency as it gains energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic effects. The problem says T ≈ 950 MeV. At such high energies, relativistic effects are significant. The relativistic mass increase would affect the cyclotron frequency. So the cyclotron frequency is given by ω = (q B)/(γ m), where γ is the Lorentz factor. So as the proton gains energy, γ increases, and ω decreases, requiring the accelerating frequency ν to decrease.

But how does this affect the number of revolutions? Hmmm. Maybe the number of revolutions is the same as in the non-relativistic case because the frequency is adjusted. But wait, no, because the time between each acceleration changes as the cyclotron frequency changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to compute the number of revolutions based on the energy gained per revolution, considering that the energy per revolution is not exactly e U0, but depends on the phase.

Wait, the initial phase is π/4. So the first acceleration occurs at a phase angle of π/4. But I'm not sure how that affects the total number of revolutions. Maybe it affects the effective voltage, but perhaps the overall number is not too much affected.

Wait, another approach: the total energy gained is the sum of the energies from each acceleration. Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e U0 sin(theta), where theta is the phase angle when it arrives. But since the phase is adjusted to match the particle's motion, perhaps each acceleration contributes a full e U0 of energy, so the initial phase doesn't matter in the total count. Or maybe the number of revolutions is just the total energy divided by e U0.

So going back, the proton's kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Each revolution gives 190 keV. So N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV/rev = 5000 rev. But the options are 5300 (B), which is close. But why isn't it exactly 5000? Maybe because of the way the phase is set. Wait, the initial phase is π/4. So maybe that affects the first acceleration. Let me think.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Φ0). The proton is injected at t=0. The acceleration occurs when the voltage is at a certain phase. But I'm not quite sure about the exact condition. The electric field must be in the right direction to accelerate the proton when it comes around. So the phase might affect the first acceleration, but for a large number of revolutions, perhaps it averages out.

Alternatively, maybe each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains a certain amount of energy. But perhaps the initial phase leads to an extra half-revolution or something.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the time taken for each revolution. The cyclotron frequency is ω = q B/(γ m). But as the proton gains energy, γ increases, so ω decreases, making each revolution take longer? Or wait, no: higher energy means higher velocity, so the time for each revolution would actually decrease. But since the accelerating voltage's frequency is adjusted to match ω, the time between each acceleration would change.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick with the first approach: N ≈ T/(e U0). Let's compute that.

T = 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

Each revolution gives e U0 = 190 keV.

So N = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

Looking at the options, B is 5300, which is close. So why the discrepancy? Maybe because the actual energy per revolution isn't exactly 190 keV, but a bit less, so more revolutions are needed. Or perhaps the initial phase affects the first acceleration, leading to a partial revolution contributing less energy, so you need a few more revolutions to make up for it.

Wait, another consideration: The voltage given is U(t), but in reality, the effective accelerating voltage is the peak voltage multiplied by the sine of the phase angle. Because the voltage is applied in phase with the particle's motion. If the initial phase is π/4, then the first acceleration is when the voltage is at maximum, so maybe that's not the case. Or maybe the effective voltage is U0 * cos(Φ0), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the effective voltage per revolution is U0 (since the phase is π/4, which is 45 degrees), but if the initial phase is π/4, then the first acceleration is at half the maximum voltage. So maybe each revolution gives e U0 * cos(Φ0), but no, that doesn't make sense because the phase is only the initial condition.

Hmm, maybe the number of revolutions is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, but perhaps the energy per revolution is e U0. Let me recalculate.

e * U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 2.88e-14 J. But 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so this is 190e3 eV, which is 190 keV. So each revolution gives 190 keV.

So 950 MeV / 190 keV = 950,000 keV / 190 keV/rev = approximately 5000 revolutions.

So the closest option is B) 5300.

Wait, but why isn't it exactly 5000? Maybe because of relativistic effects or because the initial acceleration doesn't give the full 190 keV. Let me see.

At T=950 MeV, the total energy is approximately 950 MeV, and the rest mass of the proton is about 938 MeV. So the proton is highly relativistic. The kinetic energy is T = (γ - 1) m c². So γ = (T + m c²)/m c² = (950 + 938)/938 ≈ 1.997. So γ is about 2.

Hmm, in the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But at γ ≈2, the relativistic effects are significant. So the energy per revolution might not be exactly e U0. Perhaps the actual energy per revolution is less, meaning more revolutions are needed.

Wait, but wait. In a cyclotron, the energy gained per revolution is e U0. But when the particle is moving relativistically, the momentum is γ m v, and the cyclotron frequency depends on the momentum. So the frequency ν is (q B)/(2 π γ m). So as the particle gains energy, γ increases, and ν decreases. But the accelerating voltage's frequency is adjusted to match ν, so each time the particle comes around, it gets a full e U0 of energy.

So perhaps the initial approach holds, and the number of revolutions is approximately 5000. But the options don't have 5000, they have 5300. So maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me do the math again. 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. U0 is 190 keV. So 950,000 / 190 = 5000 exactly. So why is option B 5300? Hmm, perhaps because the initial acceleration doesn't give the full e U0. Because at t=0, the phase is π/4, so the voltage is U0 * cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707 U0. So the first acceleration gives e U0 * cos(π/4) ≈ 136.9 keV. Then, each subsequent acceleration gives full 190 keV.

So the first revolution gives 136.9 keV, and the others give 190 keV. So the total energy would be 136.9 + 190*(N-1). So setting 136.9 + 190*(N-1) = 950,000.

Wait, 950,000 = 136.9 + 190(N-1)

So 950,000 -136.9 = 190(N-1)

949,863.1 ≈ 190(N-1)

N-1 ≈ 949,863.1 / 190 ≈ 5000. So N ≈ 5001.

Hmm, so approximately 5001 revolutions. But that's still close to 5000. So why is the option 5300?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the formula for the number of revolutions isn't as straightforward because the phase affects the initial acceleration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the proton must complete each revolution before the next acceleration, which might add some extra revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N = T/(e U0) * (something), considering that each acceleration doesn't give the full e U0. Or maybe the phase shift affects the number of required revolutions.

Wait, another approach: the energy gained per revolution is e U0, but in reality, because the phase is π/4, the initial acceleration is only partial. So the total number of revolutions needed is (T / (e U0)) * (something). But I'm not sure exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the energy per revolution is e U0 * (1 - cos Φ0), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Φ0). The electric field accelerates the proton when the voltage is in the correct phase. The maximum acceleration occurs when the voltage is maximum, but when the proton arrives at the gap. So the effective voltage for each acceleration is the voltage at the moment the proton arrives. The initial phase might affect whether the first acceleration is at maximum or not.

But wait, for the first acceleration at t=0, the voltage is U(0) = U0 cos(Φ0) = U0 * cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 136.9 kV. So the first energy gain is e * U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Then, each subsequent acceleration occurs when the voltage is at the correct phase, which would be at the same phase as the cyclotron frequency. But the cyclotron frequency is changing, so the phase might not be the same each time.

Wait, perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions, as the frequency is adjusted to match the proton's motion. So the first acceleration's lower voltage might be compensated by the frequency adjustment. So, maybe the proton still gains approximately e U0 per revolution on average.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by T/(e U0) = 950,000 keV / 190 keV/rev = 5000. But since the first rev only gives 136.9 keV, and the rest give 190, maybe the calculation is (950,000 - 136.9) / 190 + 1 ≈ 5000.

But that gives 5000. So why is the option B 5300? Maybe I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is more accurately N = T/(e U0) * (something). Let me think about the relation between the energy and number of revolutions.

In a cyclotron, the kinetic energy gained is approximately N e U0, where N is the number of revolutions. So if T is 950 MeV, and each rev gives 190 keV, N is 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

But perhaps the correct approach is to consider the time taken for each revolution and sum up the energies. Because the frequency is adjusted, the time per revolution changes.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the time between each acceleration is such that the phase of the voltage matches the arrival of the particle. So each acceleration imparts a full e U0 of energy, regardless of the phase. So the initial phase would only affect the first acceleration, but the number of revolutions would still be T/(e U0) = 5000.

But again, the answer options don't have 5000. The closest is B) 5300.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each half-revolution is an acceleration. Because in a cyclotron, the voltage alternates each half-period, so perhaps each half-revolution gives an acceleration. Wait, no, in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across the gap, and the particles are accelerated each time they cross the gap, which is once per revolution. So each full revolution gives one acceleration, which gives e U0 of energy.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the total number of revolutions using the formula for the synchrocyclotron.

The accelerating voltage's frequency ν is adjusted to match the proton's cyclotron frequency. The cyclotron frequency is given by ω = (q B)/(γ m), but since ν is adjusted, the condition is 2π ν = ω (which is the condition for the voltage to be in phase when the proton arrives at the gap).

The number of revolutions N is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution. So N = T/(e U0) = (950e3 keV)/(190 keV) ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is option B:5300. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check:

U0 is 190 kV, so 190,000 volts. e is 1.6e-19 C. So e U0 is 190,000 * 1.6e-19 = 3.04e-14 J. Converting to eV: 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = 190,000 eV = 190 keV. So that's correct.

T is 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

950,000 /190 is 5000.

But the options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

So the correct answer isn't among the options. Hmm, but that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the energy per revolution. Maybe in a synchrocyclotron, the energy per revolution isn't e U0, but e U0 multiplied by the sine of the phase. Or perhaps the number of revolutions is more because the voltage is applied multiple times per revolution.

Wait, maybe the number of revolutions is the total energy divided by the product of e, U0, and some factor. Let me think differently. Maybe the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron is N = (T) / (e U0) * (2π/Φ0). No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another approach: The energy gained per turn is e U0 (1 - cos Φ0) or something like that. Because the maximum voltage is U0, but the initial phase is Φ0, so the effective voltage might be U0 (1 - cos Φ0). Or wait, perhaps the average voltage is U0 (1 - cos Φ0)/2. Hmm, because the average of cos(θ) over a full cycle is zero, but when you're starting at a certain phase, perhaps the effective voltage is U0 (1 - cos Φ0)/something.

Wait, maybe the effective voltage per revolution is e U0 (1 - cos Φ0), given the initial phase. Because the first acceleration is at phase Φ0, and each subsequent acceleration is at the same phase.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So the voltage starts at U0 * cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Then, after each revolution, the proton comes back to the gap when the voltage is at the same phase, but because the frequency is adjusted, the phase is maintained.

Wait, perhaps the voltage at each acceleration is the same as the initial phase. So each time the proton is accelerated, the voltage is cos(Φ0) * U0. So each revolution gives e U0 cos(Φ0) of energy.

So the total energy T = e U0 cos(Φ0) * N.

So N = T / (e U0 cos Φ0 )

Plugging in the numbers:

T = 950e3 keV = 950,000 keV.

e U0 cos(Φ0) = 190 keV * cos(π/4) ≈ 190 * 0.7071 ≈ 134.35 keV.

So N = 950,000 / 134.35 ≈ 7066 revolutions. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton is accelerated, it gets e U0 of energy because the phase is adjusted each time. So the initial phase doesn't matter because the frequency is set to match the proton's motion. So each acceleration gives e U0, leading back to 5000 revolutions.

But since the options don't have 5000, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron, which is N = (T) / (e U0) * (γ)/(γ_initial). But since γ_initial is 1 (negligible kinetic energy), so γ is about 2.

So N ≈ 5000 * 2 = 10,000. But that's also not an option.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the relation between the magnetic field and the energy. But without knowing the magnetic field, that might not be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula where the number of revolutions is given by N = (T) / (e U0) multiplied by the ratio of the final to initial frequencies. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is N = (T)/(e U0) * (gamma) / (gamma_initial). If the initial gamma is 1, and final gamma is about 2, then N would be 5000 * 2 = 10,000. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (T)/(e U0) * (something else). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time taken for each revolution. The cyclotron frequency is ω = (q B)/(γ m). The period T_rev is 2π/ω = 2π γ m/(q B). As the proton gains energy, γ increases, so the period increases. But the accelerating voltage's frequency ν is adjusted to match ω, so the time between each acceleration is the same as the revolution time.

Wait, but each time the proton is accelerated, it gains energy e U0. So the number of revolutions would still be T/(e U0), which is 5000.

But since none of the options is 5000, perhaps the actual formula is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the voltage given is the amplitude, and the effective voltage is lower, requiring more revolutions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct number is 3536, which is option C. Let me see: 190 keV * 3536 ≈ 671,840 keV = 671.84 MeV. That's less than the required 950 MeV. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is considering that each revolution gives e U0, but the initial phase affects the first acceleration, so the first gives e U0 * cos(Φ0), and the rest give e U0. So let me compute that.

Total energy T = e U0 cos(Φ0) + (N-1) e U0.

So N = (T - e U0 cosΦ0) / (e U0) + 1.

Plugging the numbers: T=950e3 keV, e U0=190 keV, cos(Phi0)=sqrt(2)/2≈0.7071.

So N = (950e3 - 190*0.7071) / 190 +1.

Calculate 190 * 0.7071 ≈ 134.35 keV.

So 950e3 - 134.35 ≈ 949,865.65 keV.

Divide by 190: 949,865.65 / 190 ≈5000.

Plus 1: about 5001. So approximately 5000. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to consider that the phase doesn't matter in the long run, and the number of revolutions is 5000. Since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is B) 5300 because it's the closest.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the units. Let me check U0: the problem says U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So e U0 is 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. Correct.

Another thought: Maybe the number of revolutions is calculated using the relation N= (T )/(e U0) multiplied by (gamma +1). Because at high energies, the relativistic effects might require more revolutions.

Wait, when T=950 MeV, the gamma is about (950 + 938)/938 ≈ 1.997, so gamma ≈2. So N = 5000 * 2 = 10,000. No, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of revolutions is approximately T/(e U0) multiplied by the ratio of (gamma +1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula N = T/(e U0) * (1 / sin(theta)), where theta is some phase angle. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The energy per revolution is e U0. So the number of revolutions is 950,000 keV / 190 keV/rev = 5000. The closest option is B) 5300. But why? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps the initial phase leads to an extra partial revolution.

Wait, perhaps the initial acceleration occurs at phase Φ0, which is π/4, so the first acceleration gives e U0 * sin(Φ0) or something. So the first energy gain is different. Let me think.

The electric field E(t) is related to the voltage by E(t) = -dU/dt. The acceleration is F = e E(t). The acceleration experienced by the proton is e dU/dt. But integrating F over time gives the momentum change.

But perhaps the effective energy gain per revolution is e U0, so the initial phase doesn't change the total number of revolutions. So the answer is 5000, but since it's not an option, I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the time taken for each revolution. The cyclotron frequency is ω = (q B)/(γ m). The time per revolution is T_rev = 2π/(ω) = 2π γ m/(q B).

But since the frequency ν of the accelerating voltage is adjusted to match ω, the time between each acceleration is T_rev.

The number of revolutions N is the total time divided by T_rev.

But I don't know B, so I'm stuck.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula N = T/(e U0) * (gamma), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the same as the number of times the proton crosses the gap, which is the same as the number of revolutions.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time. I'll go with the initial approach: N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV/rev ≈5000. The closest option is B)5300. So I'll choose B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we start by analyzing the energy gained per revolution. The proton is accelerated by the oscillating voltage \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \). The proton's kinetic energy increases from negligible initial energy to \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Assumptions and Formula
1. The energy gained per revolution is approximately \( e U_0 \), where \( e \) is the elementary charge and \( U_0 \) is the peak voltage.
2. The total number of revolutions \( N \) is given by:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0}
   \]
   where \( T_1 \) is the total kinetic energy, \( e U_0 \) is the energy gained per revolution, and \( N \) is the number of revolutions.

### Calculation
1. Convert the total kinetic energy \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \) to keV:
   \[
   T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV}.
   \]
2. The energy gained per revolution is:
   \[
   e U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV}.
   \]
3. Substitute into the formula for \( N \):
   \[
   N = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV/rev}} \approx 5000 \, \text{revolutions}.
   \]

### Refinement
The initial phase \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) affects the first acceleration. The voltage at \( t = 0 \) is:
\[
U(0) = U_0 \cos(\Phi_0) = U_0 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = U_0 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 136.9 \, \text{kV}.
\]
Thus, the first acceleration gives less than the full \( 190 \, \text{keV} \). To account for this, the total number of revolutions is slightly adjusted:
\[
N = \frac{T_1 - e U_0 \cos(\Phi_0)}{e U_0} + 1.
\]
Substituting \( T_1 = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \), \( e U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV} \), and \( e U_0 \cos(\Phi_0) \approx 136.9 \, \text{keV} \):
\[
N = \frac{950,000 - 136.9}{190} + 1 \approx 5000.
\]

### Closest Option
The calculated value of \( N \) is approximately \( 5000 \), and the closest option provided is \( 5300 \). This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or additional considerations not explicitly stated in the problem.

ANSWER: B
