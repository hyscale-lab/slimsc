Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. The stars are Star_1 and Star_2. Both have masses more than our Sun, but I'm not sure if their masses matter here. The problem gives me some elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, but I'm not too clear on how that's used. 

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, so for the Sun, nFe/H is 3.16e-5 and Mg/H is 1e-5. So Mg is less abundant than Fe in the Sun by a factor of about 3.16.

I need to find [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2] or the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2?

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's Si_1/Si_2.

But how do I get that from the given data?

Let me think about the abundance ratios. The notation [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log_Sun(nX/nY). So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities, relative to the Sun.

So let's break down the data:

First, for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(Fe/H)_1 - log(Fe/H)_sun =0 → log(Fe/H)_1 = log(Fe/H)_sun.

So Fe is same as Sun in Star_1.

Now, for Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(Mg/Si)_2 - log(Mg/Si)_sun =0.3 → log(Mg/Si)_2 =0.3 + log(Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(Mg/H)_2 = log(Mg/H)_sun.

Wait, but how do I relate this to Si?

Hmm, perhaps I should express all the elements in terms of H.

Let me consider Star_1 first.

In Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H.

From the Sun's data, Fe/H is 3.16e-5. So Star_1's Fe/H is same as Sun's.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But wait, what's [Si/Fe]_sun? Let's compute it.

In the Sun, nSi/nFe = ?

Wait, I have nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH.

But I don't have nSi directly. Maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun. Wait, [Si/Fe] is the logarithm of (nSi/nFe) relative to the Sun. But how?

Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is:

[X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

So for the Sun, [X/Y] would be zero, of course.

Wait, but how to find the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps write all the ratios in terms of H, then find the ratios of Si in each star.

Let me try this.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H.

So, Fe_1 = (Fe/Sun) * Fe_sun = same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

Because [X/Y]_star = log(X/Y star) - log(X/Y sun) = 0.3.

Wait, no. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

Wait, no. Let me correct:

[X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_sun = [X/Y].

So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

But I don't know Si_sun/Fe_sun. Wait, from the Sun's data, what's [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. The question only gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Oh, wait, maybe I can compute it.

Wait, I have nFe = 3.16e-5 nH.

But I need nSi. I don't have nSi from the Sun's data. Hmm. So perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, let's see.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0. So Fe_1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) +0.3.

But let's denote [Si/Fe]_sun as S. Then log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) = S.

So log(Si_1/Fe_1) = S +0.3.

But I need Si_1 in terms of H. Let me express Si_1 as (Si_1/Fe_1) * Fe_1.

Since Fe_1 = Fe_sun, and Si_1 = (10^{S +0.3}) * Fe_1.

But Fe_1 = Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 nH.

So Si_1 = 10^{S+0.3} * 3.16e-5 nH.

But wait, I don't know S, which is [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can express all ratios in terms of H.

Let me think: for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, so Fe_1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun / 10^{S} ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The [Si/Fe] ratio for Star_1 is 0.3, which means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher by 10^0.3 compared to the Sun.

So, (Si_1)/(Fe_1) = 10^{0.3} * (Si_sun)/(Fe_sun).

But since Fe_1 = Fe_sun (because [Fe/H]_1=0), we have:

Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

So, the amount of Si in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of Si in the Sun.

Wait, but I don't know Si_sun's value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Si/H]_sun.

Because Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

But Si_1 is measured relative to Fe, which is same as Sun.

Wait, perhaps I need to relate Si to H.

Let me write [Si/H]_1 = log(Si_1/H) - log(Si_sun/H).

Wait, [Si/H]_1 would be log(Si_1 / H) - log(Si_sun / H).

But I don't have [Si/H]_1 given. Hmm, I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should express Si in terms of Fe and then Fe in terms of H.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) * Fe_1.

But Fe_1 is Fe_sun, so:

Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) * Fe_sun = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

So Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

Thus, [Si/H]_1 = log(Si_1/H) - log(Si_sun/H) = log(10^{0.3} * Si_sun / H) - log(Si_sun /H) = 0.3.

Wait, that can't be right because 10^{0.3} is a multiplicative factor, not additive.

Wait, no: log(a * b) = log a + log b. So [Si/H]_1 would be log(10^{0.3} * (Si_sun/H)) ) → log(10^{0.3}) + log(Si_sun/H) → 0.3 + log(Si_sun/H).

But [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_sun.

Hmm, but I don't have [Si/H]_sun. So maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can focus on Star_2 and see if I can find [Si/H]_2.

Star_2's data:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(Mg_2/Si_2) = 0.3 + log(Mg_sun/Si_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun.

So, Mg_2 = Mg_sun.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have:

Mg_2 / Si_2 = 10^{0.3} * (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

But Mg_2 is Mg_sun, so:

Mg_sun / Si_2 = 10^{0.3} * (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

Divide both sides by Mg_sun:

1/Si_2 =10^{0.3} * (1/Si_sun) → Si_2 = Si_sun / 10^{0.3}.

So, Si_2 = 10^{-0.3} * Si_sun.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(Si_2/H) - log(Si_sun/H) = log(10^{-0.3} * (Si_sun/H)) ) → log(10^{-0.3}) + log(Si_sun/H) → -0.3 + [Si/H]_sun.

So, [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

But again, I don't know [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But I don't have the Sun's nSi data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) = [Si/Fe]_sun.

But I don't know that value either.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] or [Si/H]. Maybe I can relate the two stars' silicon abundances by expressing both in terms of the Sun's abundance.

So, for Star_1: Si_1 =10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

For Star_2: Si_2 =10^{-0.3} * Si_sun.

So, the ratio Si_1/Si_2 = (10^{0.3} * Si_sun) / (10^{-0.3} * Si_sun) )= 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9 or 4.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

So, the ratio is Star_1's Si divided by Star_2's Si, which is about 3.98, so option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check.

Wait, for Star_1: Si_1 =10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

Star_2: Si_2 =10^{-0.3} * Si_sun.

So ratio Si1/Si2 =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

So, the answer would be option A, ~3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. The key steps are as follows:

1. **For Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^{0.3} times the ratio in the Sun. Thus, Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

2. **For Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies that the ratio of Mg to H in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies that the ratio of Mg to Si in Star_2 is 10^{0.3} times the ratio in the Sun. Rearranging, Si_2 = Si_sun / 10^{0.3}.

3. **Ratio of Silicon**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \text{Si}_{\odot}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \text{Si}_{\odot}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
     \]
   - Calculating \(10^{0.6}\), we find it is approximately 3.98, which rounds to 3.9.

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, so for the Sun, nFe/H is 3.16e-5 and Mg/H is 1e-5. So Mg is less abundant than Fe in the Sun by a factor of about 3.16.

I need to find [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2] or the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2?

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's Si_1/Si_2.

Let me think about the abundance ratios. The notation [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log_Sun(nX/nY). So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities, relative to the Sun.

So let's break down the data:

First, for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(Fe/H)_1 - log(Fe/H)_sun =0 → log(Fe/H)_1 = log(Fe/H)_sun.

So Fe is same as Sun in Star_1.

Now, for Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(Mg/Si)_2 - log(Mg/Si)_sun =0.3 → log(Mg/Si)_2 =0.3 + log(Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(Mg/H)_2 = log(Mg/H)_sun.

Wait, but how do I relate this to Si?

Hmm, perhaps I should express all the elements in terms of H.

Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is:

So for the Sun, [X/Y] would be zero, of course.

Wait, but how to find the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps write all the ratios in terms of H, then find the ratios of Si in each star.

Let me try this.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H.

So, Fe_1 = (Fe/Sun) * Fe_sun = same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

Because [X/Y]_star = log(X/Y star) - log(X/Y sun) = 0.3.

Wait, no. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

Wait, no. Let me correct:

[X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_sun = [X/Y].

So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = 0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

But I don't know Si_sun/Fe_sun. Wait, from the Sun's data, what's [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. The question only gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Oh, wait, maybe I can compute it.

Wait, I have nFe = 3.16e-5 nH.

But I need nSi. I don't have nSi from the Sun's data. Hmm. So perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, let's see.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0. So Fe_1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) = log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) +0.3.

But let's denote [Si/Fe]_sun as S. Then log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) = S.

So log(Si_1/Fe_1) = S +0.3.

But I need Si_1 in terms of H. Let me express Si_1 as (Si_1/Fe_1) * Fe_1.

Since Fe_1 = Fe_sun, and Si_1 = (10^{S +0.3}) * Fe_1.

But Fe_1 = Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 nH.

So Si_1 = 10^{S+0.3} * 3.16e-5 nH.

But wait, I don't know S, which is [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can express all ratios in terms of H.

Let me think: for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, so Fe_1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun / 10^{S} ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The [Si/Fe] ratio for Star_1 is 0.3, which means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher by 10^0.3 compared to the Sun.

So, (Si_1)/(Fe_1) = 10^{0.3} * (Si_sun)/(Fe_sun).

But since Fe_1 = Fe_sun (because [Fe/H]_1=0), we have:

Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

So, the amount of Si in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of Si in the Sun.

Wait, but I don't know Si_sun's value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Si/H]_sun.

Because Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

But Si_1 is measured relative to Fe, which is same as Sun.

Wait, perhaps I need to relate Si to H.

Let me write [Si/H]_1 = log(Si_1/H) - log(Si_sun/H).

Wait, [Si/H]_1 would be log(Si_1 / H) - log(Si_sun / H).

But I don't have [Si/H]_1 given. Hmm, I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should express Si in terms of Fe and then Fe in terms of H.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) * Fe_1.

But Fe_1 is Fe_sun, so:

Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) * Fe_sun = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

So Si_1 = 10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

Thus, [Si/H]_1 = log(Si_1/H) - log(Si_sun/H) = log(10^{0.3} * Si_sun / H) - log(Si_sun /H) = 0.3.

Wait, that can't be right because 10^{0.3} is a multiplicative factor, not additive.

Wait, no: log(a * b) = log a + log b. So [Si/H]_1 would be log(10^{0.3} * (Si_sun/H)) ) → log(10^{0.3}) + log(Si_sun/H) → 0.3 + log(Si_sun/H).

But [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_sun.

Hmm, but I don't have [Si/H]_sun. So maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can focus on Star_2 and see if I can find [Si/H]_2.

Star_2's data:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(Mg_2/Si_2) = 0.3 + log(Mg_sun/Si_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun.

So, Mg_2 = Mg_sun.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have:

Mg_2 / Si_2 = 10^{0.3} * (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

But Mg_2 is Mg_sun, so:

Mg_sun / Si_2 = 10^{0.3} * (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

Divide both sides by Mg_sun:

1/Si_2 =10^{0.3} * (1/Si_sun) → Si_2 = Si_sun / 10^{0.3}.

So, Si_2 = 10^{-0.3} * Si_sun.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(Si_2/H) - log(Si_sun/H) = log(10^{-0.3} * (Si_sun/H)) ) → log(10^{-0.3}) + log(Si_sun/H) → -0.3 + [Si/H]_sun.

So, [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

But again, I don't know [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But I don't have the Sun's nSi data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) = [Si/Fe]_sun.

But I don't know that value either.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] or [Si/H]. Maybe I can relate the two stars' silicon abundances by expressing both in terms of the Sun's abundance.

So, for Star_1: Si_1 =10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

For Star_2: Si_2 =10^{-0.3} * Si_sun.

So, the ratio Si_1/Si_2 = (10^{0.3} * Si_sun) / (10^{-0.3} * Si_sun) )= 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9 or 4.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

So, the ratio is Star_1's Si divided by Star_2's Si, which is about 3.98, so option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check.

Wait, for Star_1: Si_1 =10^{0.3} * Si_sun.

Star_2: Si_2 =10^{-0.3} * Si_sun.

So ratio Si1/Si2 =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

So, the answer would be option A, ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. The key steps are as follows:

2. **For Star_2**:

   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies that the ratio of Mg to Si in Star_2 is 10^{0.3} times the ratio in the Sun. Rearranging, Si_2 = Si_sun / 10^{0.3}.

3. **Ratio of Silicon**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \text{Si}_{\odot}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \text{Si}_{\odot}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
     \]
   - Calculating \(10^{0.6}\), we find it is approximately 3.98, which rounds to 3.9.

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9. 

Answer: A
