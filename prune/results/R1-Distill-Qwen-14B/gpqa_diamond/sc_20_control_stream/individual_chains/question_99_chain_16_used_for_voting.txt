Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and two characterization techniques were used: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR shows several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, there are two specific complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different compounds, all of which seem to be substituted butanoic acids or similar structures.

Let me first break down the FTIR data. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching, which is present in carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid since it's around that region. So the compound must have a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR data: the absence of vinyl hydrogens means there are no double bonds, so all the structures should be saturated. Also, the splitting patterns are a bit complex. Let me think about each splitting.

A doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq) would come from a proton that's coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons. Each coupling would split the signal further. Similarly, a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt) is another complex splitting, maybe from a proton coupled with multiple neighboring groups.

Looking at the options, all the compounds have a COOH group at the end. Let's list them:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like a central CH2 connected to two substituents (C2H5 and CH3?), wait wait, not quite. Let me parse it: The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 and a CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the central two carbons each have two substituents. Let me see: the molecule is CH3-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no. Looking at the formula, the first part is CH3C(H)(C2H5), which is a CH2 group attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 (ethyl) group. So it's like, a central part with two CH groups each substituted with ethyl and methyl groups. Hmm, maybe it's a geminal diethyl group or something else? Or perhaps it's a branching point.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like a four-carbon chain, with each of the middle two carbons bearing substituents. Let me think in terms of the NMR signals.

Wait, the problem says there are several peaks in the NMR, none being vinyl. So, all are aliphatic protons. The splitting could be due to neighboring groups.

In the NMR, the splitting patterns are complex. Let's think: a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests a proton that's split by three different neighboring groups. Each coupling is with a different set, so each would add a splitting.

For example, if a proton is next to three different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant. Alternatively, it could be a result of coupling with two or more sets, each causing their own splits.

Wait, maybe the structure has a central CH group which is connected to several other CH groups. Let me think about each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, this is a four-carbon chain with two CH groups each substituted with a CH3. So the third carbon has a CH group attached to a CH3, and the fourth carbon (second to COOH) is another CH group attached to a CH3. So the chain is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but wait, that would make it a five-carbon chain if the COOH is on the fifth carbon. Alternatively, maybe the COOH is on the fourth, making it four carbons. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me count the carbons.

Option D: The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So it's:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, that would be five carbons in the chain. Because COOH is the fifth. So the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
Carbon 5: COOH.

So the structure is like that. So the NMR would have protons on carbons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. But wait, carbon 5 is COOH, which doesn't have any protons attached. So, the protons are on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Wait, but wait. The COOH is at the end, so the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH? No, wait. Wait, the formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Let me write the structure step by step.

The compound is: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), and carbon 4 is also CH(CH3). So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the chain longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The main chain is four carbons, with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(CH3)(H)-CH(CH3)-COOH. No, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw each option's structure.

Let me list the four options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the main chain is four carbons with substituents on carbons 2 and 3.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the substituents are on carbons 3 and 4.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So substituents on carbons 2 and 3.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So substituents on carbons 3 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the middle. Let me think about each structure's possible NMR signals.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens suggests no double bonds, which matches all options since they all have single bonds.

The question mentions two specific splitting patterns: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt). That's pretty complex. So perhaps these protons are each coupled to multiple neighboring protons.

Let me think about which structure would lead to such complex splitting.

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the chain as:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: COOH.

But wait, in five carbons, the substituents on carbons 3 and 4.

So, the protons on carbon 3 (CH(CH3)) and 4 (CH(CH3)) would each have neighboring protons.

But wait, in the NMR, each proton's splitting depends on the neighboring groups.

Looking for a proton that might be next to several different sets of protons. Let's think about the CH(CH3) groups.

Carbon 3: CH(CH3) is attached to carbon 2 (CH2) and carbon 4 (CH(CH3)).

So the protons on carbon 3 are each adjacent to the protons on carbon 2 and carbon 4.

Similarly, the protons on carbon 4 are adjacent to carbon 3 and carbon 5 (which is COOH, so no protons).

Wait, but the protons on carbon 3 would be neighboring to the CH2 group (carbon 2) and the CH(CH3) group (carbon 4).

So, the protons on carbon 3 (each CH has two H's) would be split by the protons on carbon 2 and carbon 4.

Wait, but each CH(CH3) group has two hydrogens. So each of those H's would split into multiple peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are causing the complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the central carbons (carbons 3 and 4) each have two substituents (CH3 and another group), leading the H's on those carbons to be split by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, looking for a structure where a particular proton is split by multiple neighboring groups with different J values.

Let me think about each option's structure and the possible NMR signals:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH group attached to an ethyl group and another substituent. Let me see:

Carbon 2: CH attached to C2H5 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH group with two ethyl groups (no, wait, each has one ethyl and one H). So, each CH has two substituents: one ethyl and one CH from the next carbon.

In this case, the protons on carbon 2 would be adjacent to the ethyl group (which might not split since they're on adjacent carbons, but wait, ethyl groups are larger and their protons are farther away. Wait, but splitting occurs through coupling between adjacent protons. So if a proton on carbon 2 is adjacent to the protons on carbon 1 (CH3) and carbon 3 (CH), then it would split based on those.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each proton's neighboring protons.

Protons on a given carbon can couple with protons on adjacent carbons. So for a CH group, each proton may couple with protons on the neighboring carbons.

In option A, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(C2H5)-

Carbon 3: CH(C2H5)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: COOH.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbon 2 has a CH with a C2H5 substituent, and carbon 3 is similar. So, for the protons on carbon 2, what are the neighboring groups?

Carbon 1: CH3 (three H's), but they are on the adjacent carbon. So the H's on carbon 2 would couple with the H's on carbon 1.

Wait, but carbon 1 is a CH3, which has three equivalent H's. So the H's on carbon 2 would each be split by the three H's on carbon 1, leading to a quartet (n+1, n=3). But wait, each H on carbon 2 is also adjacent to the H's on carbon 3.

Wait, carbon 2: each H is on a CH group attached to a C2H5 and a CH from carbon 3.

So, the H on carbon 2 would be next to the H on carbon 3. So, the splitting would be a doublet from the adjacent H on carbon 3 and a triplet from the three H's on carbon 1. Wait, so the coupling could lead to a triplet of doublets, but the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 2 are coupled with the H's on carbon 1 (three H's, so quartet), and with the H's on carbon 3 (two H's, so triplet), and also with any other groups.

Wait, if a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different J value, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, or more if more couplings. But in the question, the splitting is a doublet of triplets of quartets, suggesting three different coupling constants.

So perhaps a proton is coupled with three different groups.

Wait, maybe in option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3, each with a CH(CH3) group.

The protons on carbon 2 would be adjacent to the CH3 on carbon 1 and the CH(CH3) on carbon 3.

So the H on carbon 2 could couple with the H's on carbon 1 (CH3, which is three H's, so quartet) and the H's on carbon 3 (two H's, triplet). So the splitting would be a quartet of triplets, or a triplet of quartets, leading to a doublet of something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on carbon 2 is also coupled with the H's on carbon 4 (CH2 group), which has two H's. So that would add another split.

Wait, carbon 4 is CH2, so two H's. So, if the H on carbon 2 is coupled with carbon 1 (3H, quartet), carbon 3 (2H, triplet), and carbon 4 (2H, triplet?), but wait, I'm not sure if H's on carbon 2 couple with those on carbon 4. Because they are two carbons away (carbon 2 is next to 1 and 3; 3 is next to 4). So the H on 2 would be adjacent to H on 3, which is adjacent to H on 4. But through-space coupling is unlikely; it's through bonds. So H on 2 would couple with H on 3, but not directly with H on 4.

So, the H on carbon 2 would have two couplings: from carbon 1 (3H) and carbon 3 (2H). So the splitting would be a triplet from carbon 3 (n=2) and a quartet from carbon 1 (n=3), so the signal would be a quartet of triplets. Which doesn't exactly fit the question's description, but maybe another group has more couplings.

Wait, the question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A doublet would mean two peaks, perhaps from one coupling. The triplet suggests another coupling, and the quartet another. So, perhaps a proton is coupled with three different sets of neighbors, each with different J values.

Let me think about option A again: each CH on carbons 2 and 3 is attached to an ethyl group. So, the H's on carbon 2 would be adjacent to carbon 1's CH3 (three H's), and carbon 3's CH. So, maybe each H on 2 is split by the three H's on 1 (quartet) and the two H's on 3 (triplet). That gives a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets.

But the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps a proton in the structure is coupled with three different groups. For example, in a structure where a CH group is adjacent to two other CH groups, each with two H's. Wait, that could lead to a more complex splitting. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe a central CH group is coupled with two different CH groups on either side. For example, if you have a CH2-CH-CH-CH2 structure, the middle CH's H would be coupled with both adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this structure, the H's on the third carbon (CH(CH3)) are adjacent to the CH2 group (carbon 2) and the CH(CH3) group (carbon 4).

So, the H's on carbon 3 would be next to the two H's on carbon 2 (CH2), and next to the two H's on carbon 4 (CH(CH3)).

So, each H on carbon 3 would couple with the two H's on carbon 2 (so a triplet) and with the two H's on carbon 4 (another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? No, wait, each coupling adds a split. So, each H on 3 would have J1 with H's on 2 (n=2 → triplet), and J2 with H's on 4 (n=2 → triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? Wait, no. The splitting from two different J values would be a doublet of triplets (each triplet from one coupling and each doublet from another). Or perhaps more accurately, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 are split by more than two groups.

Wait, another approach: each coupling is with a different set of protons. If a proton is adjacent to three different sets of protons, each with a different J, then the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, etc.

So, perhaps in option A, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to three different groups: the CH3 on carbon 1, the CH on carbon 3, and perhaps any other substituents.

Wait, let me think about option A again. The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the H on carbon 2 is attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group and a CH (carbon 3) group.

So, the H on carbon 2 would be adjacent to:

- The three H's on carbon 1 (CH3) → quartet splitting.

- The two H's on carbon 3 (CH) → triplet splitting.

- Any other H's? Carbon 3 is a CH with a C2H5 group. So, perhaps the ethyl groups have their own H's, but those are on adjacent carbons, so they wouldn't split the H's on carbon 2.

Wait, but the ethyl groups are attached to carbons 2 and 3, but the H's on carbon 2 are on the same carbon as the ethyl group. So, would the ethyl group's H's (which are on the next carbon, carbon 2's substituent) cause any splitting? No, because coupling occurs between H's on adjacent carbons. So the H's on carbon 2 (option A) would only be coupled with the H's on carbons 1 and 3.

So, for a given H on carbon 2, the splitting would be quartet (from 3H on C1) and triplet (from 2H on C3). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets? Not exactly. Alternatively, it would result in (3+1)*(2+1) = 12 peaks, but that's not matching the question's description.

Wait, the question says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests two different types of splitting.

Let me think about which option's structure would lead to such splitting.

Option C's structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH(CH3) group.

So, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H) → quartet.

- Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (2H) → triplet.

The H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to:

- Carbon 2: CH(CH3) (2H) → triplet.

- Carbon 4: CH2 (2H) → triplet.

Wait, so the H's on carbon 3 would be coupled with 2H on carbon 2 and 2H on carbon 4. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? No, a triplet of triplets would give (2+1)*(2+1) =9 peaks. But the question mentions a doublet of triplets of triplets, which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 4 (CH2) would be coupled with the H's on carbon 3 (CH) and carbon 5 (COOH, no H). So, the H's on carbon 4 would be a triplet from the adjacent CH group (carbon 3 has 2H), but wait, the H's on carbon 4 are split by the H's on carbon 3, which are 2H, so each H on carbon 4 would be a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the H's on carbon 2 and 3 would have more complex splitting, but I'm not seeing it yet.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A, where the H's on carbon 2 are coupled with the ethyl groups. No, because the ethyl groups are substituents, not adjacent carbons.

Another approach: Let's think about the integrals in the NMR. Since none of the signals are vinyl, all H's are in the aliphatic region. The number of signals would correspond to the number of unique H environments.

Looking at each option's structure:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the possible H environments:

- Carbon 1: CH3 → one signal.

- Carbon 2: CH with C2H5 and CH → perhaps two different H's? No, because each CH is attached to the same substituents, so maybe equivalent.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then carbons 2 and 3 would have equivalent H's, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, in option A, the molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the two middle CH groups are both attached to C2H5 groups. So, this molecule is symmetric around the middle. So, the H's on both CH groups (carbons 2 and 3) would be equivalent, leading to a single signal for those two H's. Meanwhile, the CH3 on carbon 1 would be a singlet, and the CH2 on carbon 4 would be a triplet or something else.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, then the H's on carbons 2 and 3 would be the same. So the NMR would have:

- CH3 (one signal, triplet).

- CH groups (one signal, perhaps a triplet or more).

- CH2 (another signal, perhaps a quartet).

Hmm, but the question states there are several peaks, so perhaps the structure isn't symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different, leading to more signals.

Wait, option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this case, the molecule is symmetric around the center. So, the H's on carbons 3 and 4 would be equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

So, the signals would be:

- CH3 on carbon 1: triplet.

- CH2 on carbon 2: perhaps a quartet.

- CH(CH3) on carbons 3 and 4: a single signal.

Wait, but the H's on carbon 3 and 4 are each CH groups attached to CH3. So perhaps each of these would have two H's, but due to symmetry, they would be equivalent, leading to a single signal for both.

So in the NMR, there might be three signals: CH3 (triplet), CH2 (quartet), and CH(CH3) (maybe a singlet if they're equivalent? No, because each CH has two H's, so each would couple with their neighbors, leading to splitting.

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) groups are on carbons 3 and 4. So the H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on carbon 2 and the CH(CH3) on carbon 4. Similarly, the H's on carbon 4 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) on carbon 3 and the COOH group (which has no H's).

Wait, but in a symmetric structure, the H's on carbons 3 and 4 would be equivalent, so their NMR signals would merge.

So, the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the CH3 (carbon 1) and the CH(CH3) (carbon 3). So, each H on carbon 2 would couple with the CH3 (3H → quartet) and the CH(CH3) (2H → triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of quartets, which is a quartet of triplets. This might match the description.

Wait, but the question says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So if the H's on carbon 2 are a quartet of triplets, that could be the doublet of triplets of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 are split in a more complex way. Since carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 2 (CH2) and carbon 4 (CH(CH3)).

The H's on carbon 3 would be next to the CH2 on carbon 2 (2H → triplet) and the CH(CH3) on carbon 4 (2H → triplet). So, each H on carbon 3 would split into a triplet from each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? No, a triplet of triplets would give a more complex pattern.

Wait, but if the H's on carbon 3 are split by two sets of triplets (from CH2 and from CH(CH3)), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which could be described as a doublet of triplets of triplets if there's another coupling. Hmm, but where else?

Wait, maybe the H's on carbon 3 are also coupled with the H's on carbon 4. But in that case, the J value might be similar, making it a more complex split.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 are coupled with the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) and the H's on carbon 4 (CH(CH3)), leading to a triplet of triplets. That would fit the description of a doublet of triplets of triplets if there's another coupling.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about option D.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Same as option B; wait no, no, option B's formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which is the same as option D. Wait, no, let me look again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, options B and D have the same formula? No, no, wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, looking again:

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Wait, that's the same as option B. So that can't be correct. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, no, looking back:

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, so B and D are the same. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says the options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Ah, no, sorry, I think I misread earlier. So option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So, option B's structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, substituents on carbons 3 and 4 are ethyl groups. So, the H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to ethyl groups. Wait, but ethyl groups are attached to the same carbon as the H's, so maybe the H's on carbon 3 are coupled with the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) and carbon 4 (CH(CH2CH3)).

So, for the H's on carbon 3, the coupling would be with the two H's on carbon 2 (CH2, leading to a triplet) and the two H's on carbon 4 (CH, leading to another triplet). So each H on carbon 3 would be a triplet of triplets. That could match the description.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) are adjacent to the CH3 (carbon 1), the CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 3), and perhaps another group.

Wait, the H's on CH2 (carbon 2) are adjacent to the CH3 (3H, quartet) and the CH(CH2CH3) (2H, triplet). So, the H's on carbon 2 would be a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets. That could fit the first splitting pattern described in the question.

Then, the H's on carbon 3 (CH(CH2CH3)) would be adjacent to the CH2 (carbon 2, 2H, triplet) and the CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 4, 2H, triplet). So, their splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets if another coupling is present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4 cause more splitting. Wait, the ethyl groups are substituents on the same carbon as the H's. So, their H's are not adjacent but on the same carbon, so maybe they don't cause splitting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key point is the splitting patterns in the NMR. The DTq and DTt suggest that each proton is coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons.

Another thing to consider is the number of neighboring protons. For each proton, the number of neighboring protons (on adjacent carbons) would determine the splitting.

So, if a proton is next to three different sets, each with two protons, that would lead to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's adjacent to two CH2 groups and another CH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, substituents on carbons 2 and 3 are methyl groups.

The H's on carbon 2 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H, quartet).

- Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (2H, triplet).

The H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 2: CH(CH3) (2H, triplet).

- Carbon 4: CH2 (2H, triplet).

So, the H's on carbon 2 would be split into a quartet of triplets (from carbon 1 and 3). And the H's on carbon 3 would be split into a triplet of triplets (from carbons 2 and 4).

So, the H's on carbon 2 would show a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets. That could match the description of a doublet of triplets of quartets if another coupling is present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 4 (CH2) are adjacent to the CH(CH3) on carbon 3 and the COOH group (no H's). So, the CH2 on carbon 4 would be split by the two H's on carbon 3, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the question says that there are several peaks, none of which are vinyl. So, each H environment would produce a signal, but perhaps with varying splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, substituents on carbons 2 and 3 are ethyl groups.

The H's on carbon 2 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H, quartet).

- Carbon 3: CH (2H, triplet).

So, the H's on carbon 2 would be a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets. That matches the first splitting pattern described.

The H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 2: CH (2H, triplet).

- Carbon 4: CH2 (2H, triplet).

So, their splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets if another coupling is involved. But I'm not sure where the third coupling would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 have their own H's, but those are on the same carbon as the H's being considered, so they wouldn't cause splitting. So, the H's on carbon 3 would only be coupled with the H's on carbons 2 and 4.

Wait, but the H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to the ethyl group on their own carbon, which is a substituent, not an adjacent carbon. So, those H's on the ethyl group wouldn't cause splitting.

So, for the H's on carbon 3, the splitting would just be from the H's on carbons 2 and 4.

So, each H on carbon 3 would be a triplet from carbon 2 and a triplet from carbon 4, leading to a triplet of triplets. That could fit the description of a doublet of triplets of triplets if another coupling exists, but I don't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 have H's that are coupled with the H's on adjacent carbons. Let me think: the ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So, the H's on the ethyl group are on the same carbon as the CH group, so maybe they're vicinal (next to) the H's on the adjacent carbon.

But vicinal coupling is possible, but it's typically weaker and might not be observed as clearly. If that's the case, the H's on carbon 2 would be coupled with not only the H's on carbon 1 but also the H's on the ethyl group of carbon 2. But wait, the ethyl group is on carbon 2, so the H's on the ethyl would be on the same carbon as the CH, so they're not adjacent to the H's on carbon 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the splitting again.

The key is that each H is coupled with three different sets of H's. So, perhaps the structure has a CH group surrounded by three different types of H's.

Looking at option B: the H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to CH2 (carbon 2) and CH(CH3) (carbon 4). But in option B, the substituents are ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, the H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to CH2 (carbon 2) and CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 4). So, each H on carbon 3 would be coupled with 2H (CH2) and 2H (CH(CH2CH3)), leading to a triplet of triplets. That could fit the description.

Meanwhile, the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) are adjacent to CH3 (carbon 1) and CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 3). So, the H's on carbon 2 would be coupled with 3H (CH3, quartet) and 2H (CH(CH2CH3), triplet), leading to a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets.

So, in this structure, the H's on carbon 2 would show a triplet of quartets, and the H's on carbon 3 would show a triplet of triplets. But the question says one is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Not exactly matching, but perhaps the H's on carbon 3 have another coupling. Wait, the ethyl groups on carbon 3 and 4 are CH2CH3. So, the H's on the ethyl group (CH2) are on the same carbon as the CH group. So, the H's on the ethyl group are adjacent to the H's on the CH group of carbon 3. That would add another coupling.

So, the H's on the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would be coupled with the H's on carbon 3's CH group. So, the H's on the ethyl (CH2) would each be adjacent to the CH group, leading to a split. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A, where the H's on carbon 2 are coupled with three different groups.

Wait, in option A, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H → quartet).

- Carbon 3: CH (2H → triplet).

- The ethyl group on carbon 2: the CH2CH3 has three H's on the adjacent CH2. Would the H's on carbon 2's CH group couple with the H's on the ethyl group's CH2? Like, the H's on carbon 2's CH would be next to the ethyl's CH2, so vicinal coupling. So, that would add another split.

If that's the case, the H's on carbon 2 would be coupled with three groups: 3H (quartet), 2H (triplet), and another 2H (triplet from the ethyl's CH2). So, the splitting would be a quartet of triplets of triplets, which could fit the description of a doublet of triplets of quartets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of unique H environments.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The H's on carbons 2 and 3 are equivalent due to symmetry, so two signals from those CH groups. The CH3 on carbon 1, the CH2 on carbon 4, and the COOH. So total of four signals, perhaps. But the question mentions several peaks, so this might fit.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

H's on carbons 3 and 4 are equivalent, leading to two signals. Plus CH3, CH2, and COOH. So again, four signals.

But the question mentions that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps the structure has two different H environments that exhibit such complex splitting.

Hmm. It's a bit challenging, but I think the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, considering the IR data:

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 (C=O). All options have a COOH group, so that's consistent.

The NMR has no vinyl H's, which is correct for all options.

The splitting patterns suggest multiple couplings, which likely come from a structure where a CH group is flanked by two other CH groups, each with their own substituents.

After thinking through all options, I'm leaning towards option A being the correct answer because the substituents on carbons 2 and 3 are ethyl groups, which would lead to more complex splitting due to the possibility of coupling with the ethyl groups' H's. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option D might be the same as B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake in the options. Option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which is the same as option B. So that can't be right. So I must have misread the options. Let me check again.

Ah, no, the options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

So, options B and D are different. B has C2H5 substituents on carbons 3 and 4, while D has CH3 substituents.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

So, structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, option D's substituents on carbons 3 and 4 are methyl groups, while option B's are ethyl.

In this case, the H's on carbon 3 in option D would be adjacent to CH2 (carbon 2) and CH(CH3) (carbon 4).

So, the H's on carbon 3 in D would be split by 2H (CH2) → triplet and 2H (CH(CH3)) → triplet. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Similarly, the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) would be adjacent to CH3 (3H → quartet) and CH(CH3) (2H → triplet), leading to a quartet of triplets.

So, in option D, the H's on carbon 2 would show a quartet of triplets, and the H's on carbon 3 would show a triplet of triplets.

This matches the description of one signal being a doublet of triplets of quartets (perhaps quartet of triplets is equivalent) and another being a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, the quartet of triplets would be a doublet of triplets of quartets if another coupling is present. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 in option D are also coupled with the H's on carbon 4. But since the substituents are methyl, which are on the same carbon, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A because the ethyl groups would introduce more coupling partners.

In option A, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to CH3 (3H), CH (2H), and the ethyl group's CH2 (2H). So, each H on carbon 2 would be coupled with three groups: 3H, 2H, and 2H. So the splitting would be a quartet (3H) multiplied by triplet (2H) multiplied by triplet (2H), leading to a quartet of triplets of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets if the order is different.

But I'm not sure about the exact terminology. The question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would imply the splitting occurs in that order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's the only one with ethyl groups, which would have more complex coupling due to the CH2CH3 substituents.

But I'm not entirely confident. After all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR spectrum lacks vinyl hydrogens, indicating no double bonds. Additionally, two complex splitting patterns are observed: a doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt). The task is to match these observations with one of the given compounds.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**

    - CH(CH₃) (2H, triplet).
  - This results in a triplet of triplets, which also does not fully match the described splitting patterns.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fully match the observed splitting patterns.

### Final Conclusion:
Option A is the only structure that matches the observed splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR spectrum, where the H's on carbon 2 exhibit a doublet of triplets of quartets due to coupling with CH₃, CH, and the ethyl group's CH₂. The FTIR data is consistent with all options, but the unique splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum strongly support Option A as the correct answer.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and two characterization techniques were used: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR shows several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, there are two specific complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different compounds, all of which seem to be substituted butanoic acids or similar structures.

Let me first break down the FTIR data. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching, which is present in carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid since it's around that region. So the compound must have a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR data: the absence of vinyl hydrogens means there are no double bonds, so all the structures should be saturated. Also, the splitting patterns are a bit complex. Let me think about each splitting.

A doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq) would come from a proton that's coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons. Each coupling would split the signal further. Similarly, a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt) is another complex splitting, maybe from a proton coupled with multiple neighboring groups.

Looking at the options, all the compounds have a COOH group at the end. Let's list them:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like a central CH2 connected to two substituents (C2H5 and CH3?), wait wait, not quite. Let me parse it: The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 and a CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the central two carbons each have two substituents. Let me see: the molecule is CH3-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no. Looking at the formula, the first part is CH3C(H)(C2H5), which is a CH2 group attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 (ethyl) group. So it's like, a central part with two CH groups each substituted with ethyl and methyl groups. Hmm, maybe it's a geminal diethyl group or something else? Or perhaps it's a branching point.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like a four-carbon chain, with each of the middle two carbons bearing substituents. Let me think in terms of the NMR signals.

Wait, the problem says there are several peaks in the NMR, none being vinyl. So, all are aliphatic protons. The splitting could be due to neighboring groups.

In the NMR, the splitting patterns are complex. Let's think: a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests a proton that's split by three different neighboring groups. Each coupling is with a different set, so each would add a splitting.

For example, if a proton is next to three different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant. Alternatively, it could be a result of coupling with two or more sets, each causing their own splits.

Wait, maybe the structure has a central CH group which is connected to several other CH groups. Let me think about each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, this is a four-carbon chain with two CH groups each substituted with a CH3. So the third carbon has a CH group attached to a CH3, and the fourth carbon (second to COOH) is another CH group attached to a CH3. So the chain is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but wait, that would make it a five-carbon chain if the COOH is on the fifth carbon. Alternatively, maybe the COOH is on the fourth, making it four carbons. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me count the carbons.

Option D: The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So it's:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, that would be five carbons in the chain. Because COOH is the fifth. So the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
Carbon 5: COOH.

So the structure is like that. So the NMR would have protons on carbons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. But wait, carbon 5 is COOH, which doesn't have any protons attached. So, the protons are on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Wait, but wait. The COOH is at the end, so the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH? No, wait. Wait, the formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Let me write the structure step by step.

The compound is: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), and carbon 4 is also CH(CH3). So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the chain longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The main chain is four carbons, with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(CH3)(H)-CH(CH3)-COOH. No, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw each option's structure.

Let me list the four options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the main chain is four carbons with substituents on carbons 2 and 3.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the substituents are on carbons 3 and 4.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So substituents on carbons 2 and 3.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So substituents on carbons 3 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the middle. Let me think about each structure's possible NMR signals.

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens suggests no double bonds, which matches all options since they all have single bonds.

The question mentions two specific splitting patterns: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt). That's pretty complex. So perhaps these protons are each coupled to multiple neighboring protons.

Let me think about which structure would lead to such complex splitting.

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the chain as:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: COOH.

But wait, in five carbons, the substituents on carbons 3 and 4.

So, the protons on carbon 3 (CH(CH3)) and 4 (CH(CH3)) would each have neighboring protons.

But wait, in the NMR, each proton's splitting depends on the neighboring groups.

Looking for a proton that might be next to several different sets of protons. Let's think about the CH(CH3) groups.

Carbon 3: CH(CH3) is attached to carbon 2 (CH2) and carbon 4 (CH(CH3)).

So the protons on carbon 3 are each adjacent to the protons on carbon 2 and carbon 4.

Similarly, the protons on carbon 4 are adjacent to carbon 3 and carbon 5 (which is COOH, so no protons).

Wait, but the protons on carbon 3 would be neighboring to the CH2 group (carbon 2) and the CH(CH3) group (carbon 4).

So, the protons on carbon 3 (each CH has two H's) would be split by the protons on carbon 2 and carbon 4.

Wait, but each CH(CH3) group has two hydrogens. So each of those H's would split into multiple peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are causing the complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the central carbons (carbons 3 and 4) each have two substituents (CH3 and another group), leading the H's on those carbons to be split by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, looking for a structure where a particular proton is split by multiple neighboring groups with different J values.

Let me think about each option's structure and the possible NMR signals:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH group attached to an ethyl group and another substituent. Let me see:

Carbon 2: CH attached to C2H5 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH group with two ethyl groups (no, wait, each has one ethyl and one H). So, each CH has two substituents: one ethyl and one CH from the next carbon.

In this case, the protons on carbon 2 would be adjacent to the ethyl group (which might not split since they're on adjacent carbons, but wait, ethyl groups are larger and their protons are farther away. Wait, but splitting occurs through coupling between adjacent protons. So if a proton on carbon 2 is adjacent to the protons on carbon 1 (CH3) and carbon 3 (CH), then it would split based on those.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each proton's neighboring protons.

Protons on a given carbon can couple with protons on adjacent carbons. So for a CH group, each proton may couple with protons on the neighboring carbons.

In option A, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(C2H5)-

Carbon 3: CH(C2H5)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: COOH.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbon 2 has a CH with a C2H5 substituent, and carbon 3 is similar. So, for the protons on carbon 2, what are the neighboring groups?

Carbon 1: CH3 (three H's), but they are on the adjacent carbon. So the H's on carbon 2 would couple with the H's on carbon 1.

Wait, but carbon 1 is a CH3, which has three equivalent H's. So the H's on carbon 2 would each be split by the three H's on carbon 1, leading to a quartet (n+1, n=3). But wait, each H on carbon 2 is also adjacent to the H's on carbon 3.

Wait, carbon 2: each H is on a CH group attached to a C2H5 and a CH from carbon 3.

So, the H on carbon 2 would be next to the H on carbon 3. So, the splitting would be a doublet from the adjacent H on carbon 3 and a triplet from the three H's on carbon 1. Wait, so the coupling could lead to a triplet of doublets, but the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 2 are coupled with the H's on carbon 1 (three H's, so quartet), and with the H's on carbon 3 (two H's, so triplet), and also with any other groups.

Wait, if a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different J value, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, or more if more couplings. But in the question, the splitting is a doublet of triplets of quartets, suggesting three different coupling constants.

So perhaps a proton is coupled with three different groups.

Wait, maybe in option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3, each with a CH(CH3) group.

The protons on carbon 2 would be adjacent to the CH3 on carbon 1 and the CH(CH3) on carbon 3.

So the H on carbon 2 could couple with the H's on carbon 1 (CH3, which is three H's, so quartet) and the H's on carbon 3 (two H's, triplet). So the splitting would be a quartet of triplets, or a triplet of quartets, leading to a doublet of something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on carbon 2 is also coupled with the H's on carbon 4 (CH2 group), which has two H's. So that would add another split.

Wait, carbon 4 is CH2, so two H's. So, if the H on carbon 2 is coupled with carbon 1 (3H, quartet), carbon 3 (2H, triplet), and carbon 4 (2H, triplet?), but wait, I'm not sure if H's on carbon 2 couple with those on carbon 4. Because they are two carbons away (carbon 2 is next to 1 and 3; 3 is next to 4). So the H on 2 would be adjacent to H on 3, which is adjacent to H on 4. But through-space coupling is unlikely; it's through bonds. So H on 2 would couple with H on 3, but not directly with H on 4.

So, the H on carbon 2 would have two couplings: from carbon 1 (3H) and carbon 3 (2H). So the splitting would be a triplet from carbon 3 (n=2) and a quartet from carbon 1 (n=3), so the signal would be a quartet of triplets. Which doesn't exactly fit the question's description, but maybe another group has more couplings.

Wait, the question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A doublet would mean two peaks, perhaps from one coupling. The triplet suggests another coupling, and the quartet another. So, perhaps a proton is coupled with three different sets of neighbors, each with different J values.

Let me think about option A again: each CH on carbons 2 and 3 is attached to an ethyl group. So, the H's on carbon 2 would be adjacent to carbon 1's CH3 (three H's), and carbon 3's CH. So, maybe each H on 2 is split by the three H's on 1 (quartet) and the two H's on 3 (triplet). That gives a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets.

But the question says a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps a proton in the structure is coupled with three different groups. For example, in a structure where a CH group is adjacent to two other CH groups, each with two H's. Wait, that could lead to a more complex splitting. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe a central CH group is coupled with two different CH groups on either side. For example, if you have a CH2-CH-CH-CH2 structure, the middle CH's H would be coupled with both adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this structure, the H's on the third carbon (CH(CH3)) are adjacent to the CH2 group (carbon 2) and the CH(CH3) group (carbon 4).

So, the H's on carbon 3 would be next to the two H's on carbon 2 (CH2), and next to the two H's on carbon 4 (CH(CH3)).

So, each H on carbon 3 would couple with the two H's on carbon 2 (so a triplet) and with the two H's on carbon 4 (another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? No, wait, each coupling adds a split. So, each H on 3 would have J1 with H's on 2 (n=2 → triplet), and J2 with H's on 4 (n=2 → triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? Wait, no. The splitting from two different J values would be a doublet of triplets (each triplet from one coupling and each doublet from another). Or perhaps more accurately, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 are split by more than two groups.

Wait, another approach: each coupling is with a different set of protons. If a proton is adjacent to three different sets of protons, each with a different J, then the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, etc.

So, perhaps in option A, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to three different groups: the CH3 on carbon 1, the CH on carbon 3, and perhaps any other substituents.

Wait, let me think about option A again. The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the H on carbon 2 is attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group and a CH (carbon 3) group.

So, the H on carbon 2 would be adjacent to:

- The three H's on carbon 1 (CH3) → quartet splitting.

- The two H's on carbon 3 (CH) → triplet splitting.

- Any other H's? Carbon 3 is a CH with a C2H5 group. So, perhaps the ethyl groups have their own H's, but those are on adjacent carbons, so they wouldn't split the H's on carbon 2.

Wait, but the ethyl groups are attached to carbons 2 and 3, but the H's on carbon 2 are on the same carbon as the ethyl group. So, would the ethyl group's H's (which are on the next carbon, carbon 2's substituent) cause any splitting? No, because coupling occurs between H's on adjacent carbons. So the H's on carbon 2 (option A) would only be coupled with the H's on carbons 1 and 3.

So, for a given H on carbon 2, the splitting would be quartet (from 3H on C1) and triplet (from 2H on C3). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets? Not exactly. Alternatively, it would result in (3+1)*(2+1) = 12 peaks, but that's not matching the question's description.

Wait, the question says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests two different types of splitting.

Let me think about which option's structure would lead to such splitting.

Option C's structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH(CH3) group.

So, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H) → quartet.

- Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (2H) → triplet.

The H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to:

- Carbon 2: CH(CH3) (2H) → triplet.

- Carbon 4: CH2 (2H) → triplet.

Wait, so the H's on carbon 3 would be coupled with 2H on carbon 2 and 2H on carbon 4. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? No, a triplet of triplets would give (2+1)*(2+1) =9 peaks. But the question mentions a doublet of triplets of triplets, which is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 4 (CH2) would be coupled with the H's on carbon 3 (CH) and carbon 5 (COOH, no H). So, the H's on carbon 4 would be a triplet from the adjacent CH group (carbon 3 has 2H), but wait, the H's on carbon 4 are split by the H's on carbon 3, which are 2H, so each H on carbon 4 would be a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the H's on carbon 2 and 3 would have more complex splitting, but I'm not seeing it yet.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A, where the H's on carbon 2 are coupled with the ethyl groups. No, because the ethyl groups are substituents, not adjacent carbons.

Another approach: Let's think about the integrals in the NMR. Since none of the signals are vinyl, all H's are in the aliphatic region. The number of signals would correspond to the number of unique H environments.

Looking at each option's structure:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the possible H environments:

- Carbon 1: CH3 → one signal.

- Carbon 2: CH with C2H5 and CH → perhaps two different H's? No, because each CH is attached to the same substituents, so maybe equivalent.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then carbons 2 and 3 would have equivalent H's, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, in option A, the molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the two middle CH groups are both attached to C2H5 groups. So, this molecule is symmetric around the middle. So, the H's on both CH groups (carbons 2 and 3) would be equivalent, leading to a single signal for those two H's. Meanwhile, the CH3 on carbon 1 would be a singlet, and the CH2 on carbon 4 would be a triplet or something else.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, then the H's on carbons 2 and 3 would be the same. So the NMR would have:

- CH3 (one signal, triplet).

- CH groups (one signal, perhaps a triplet or more).

- CH2 (another signal, perhaps a quartet).

Hmm, but the question states there are several peaks, so perhaps the structure isn't symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different, leading to more signals.

Wait, option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this case, the molecule is symmetric around the center. So, the H's on carbons 3 and 4 would be equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

So, the signals would be:

- CH3 on carbon 1: triplet.

- CH2 on carbon 2: perhaps a quartet.

- CH(CH3) on carbons 3 and 4: a single signal.

Wait, but the H's on carbon 3 and 4 are each CH groups attached to CH3. So perhaps each of these would have two H's, but due to symmetry, they would be equivalent, leading to a single signal for both.

So in the NMR, there might be three signals: CH3 (triplet), CH2 (quartet), and CH(CH3) (maybe a singlet if they're equivalent? No, because each CH has two H's, so each would couple with their neighbors, leading to splitting.

Wait, no. The CH(CH3) groups are on carbons 3 and 4. So the H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on carbon 2 and the CH(CH3) on carbon 4. Similarly, the H's on carbon 4 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) on carbon 3 and the COOH group (which has no H's).

Wait, but in a symmetric structure, the H's on carbons 3 and 4 would be equivalent, so their NMR signals would merge.

So, the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the CH3 (carbon 1) and the CH(CH3) (carbon 3). So, each H on carbon 2 would couple with the CH3 (3H → quartet) and the CH(CH3) (2H → triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of quartets, which is a quartet of triplets. This might match the description.

Wait, but the question says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So if the H's on carbon 2 are a quartet of triplets, that could be the doublet of triplets of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 are split in a more complex way. Since carbon 3 is adjacent to carbon 2 (CH2) and carbon 4 (CH(CH3)).

The H's on carbon 3 would be next to the CH2 on carbon 2 (2H → triplet) and the CH(CH3) on carbon 4 (2H → triplet). So, each H on carbon 3 would split into a triplet from each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets? No, a triplet of triplets would give a more complex pattern.

Wait, but if the H's on carbon 3 are split by two sets of triplets (from CH2 and from CH(CH3)), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which could be described as a doublet of triplets of triplets if there's another coupling. Hmm, but where else?

Wait, maybe the H's on carbon 3 are also coupled with the H's on carbon 4. But in that case, the J value might be similar, making it a more complex split.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 are coupled with the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) and the H's on carbon 4 (CH(CH3)), leading to a triplet of triplets. That would fit the description of a doublet of triplets of triplets if there's another coupling.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about option D.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Same as option B; wait no, no, option B's formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which is the same as option D. Wait, no, let me look again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, options B and D have the same formula? No, no, wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, looking again:

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Wait, that's the same as option B. So that can't be correct. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, no, looking back:

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, so B and D are the same. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says the options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Ah, no, sorry, I think I misread earlier. So option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So, option B's structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, substituents on carbons 3 and 4 are ethyl groups. So, the H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to ethyl groups. Wait, but ethyl groups are attached to the same carbon as the H's, so maybe the H's on carbon 3 are coupled with the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) and carbon 4 (CH(CH2CH3)).

So, for the H's on carbon 3, the coupling would be with the two H's on carbon 2 (CH2, leading to a triplet) and the two H's on carbon 4 (CH, leading to another triplet). So each H on carbon 3 would be a triplet of triplets. That could match the description.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) are adjacent to the CH3 (carbon 1), the CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 3), and perhaps another group.

Wait, the H's on CH2 (carbon 2) are adjacent to the CH3 (3H, quartet) and the CH(CH2CH3) (2H, triplet). So, the H's on carbon 2 would be a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets. That could fit the first splitting pattern described in the question.

Then, the H's on carbon 3 (CH(CH2CH3)) would be adjacent to the CH2 (carbon 2, 2H, triplet) and the CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 4, 2H, triplet). So, their splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets if another coupling is present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4 cause more splitting. Wait, the ethyl groups are substituents on the same carbon as the H's. So, their H's are not adjacent but on the same carbon, so maybe they don't cause splitting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key point is the splitting patterns in the NMR. The DTq and DTt suggest that each proton is coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons.

Another thing to consider is the number of neighboring protons. For each proton, the number of neighboring protons (on adjacent carbons) would determine the splitting.

So, if a proton is next to three different sets, each with two protons, that would lead to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's adjacent to two CH2 groups and another CH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, substituents on carbons 2 and 3 are methyl groups.

The H's on carbon 2 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H, quartet).

- Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (2H, triplet).

The H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 2: CH(CH3) (2H, triplet).

- Carbon 4: CH2 (2H, triplet).

So, the H's on carbon 2 would be split into a quartet of triplets (from carbon 1 and 3). And the H's on carbon 3 would be split into a triplet of triplets (from carbons 2 and 4).

So, the H's on carbon 2 would show a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets. That could match the description of a doublet of triplets of quartets if another coupling is present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on carbon 4 (CH2) are adjacent to the CH(CH3) on carbon 3 and the COOH group (no H's). So, the CH2 on carbon 4 would be split by the two H's on carbon 3, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the question says that there are several peaks, none of which are vinyl. So, each H environment would produce a signal, but perhaps with varying splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, substituents on carbons 2 and 3 are ethyl groups.

The H's on carbon 2 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H, quartet).

- Carbon 3: CH (2H, triplet).

So, the H's on carbon 2 would be a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets. That matches the first splitting pattern described.

The H's on carbon 3 would be adjacent to:

- Carbon 2: CH (2H, triplet).

- Carbon 4: CH2 (2H, triplet).

So, their splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of triplets if another coupling is involved. But I'm not sure where the third coupling would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 have their own H's, but those are on the same carbon as the H's being considered, so they wouldn't cause splitting. So, the H's on carbon 3 would only be coupled with the H's on carbons 2 and 4.

Wait, but the H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to the ethyl group on their own carbon, which is a substituent, not an adjacent carbon. So, those H's on the ethyl group wouldn't cause splitting.

So, for the H's on carbon 3, the splitting would just be from the H's on carbons 2 and 4.

So, each H on carbon 3 would be a triplet from carbon 2 and a triplet from carbon 4, leading to a triplet of triplets. That could fit the description of a doublet of triplets of triplets if another coupling exists, but I don't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 have H's that are coupled with the H's on adjacent carbons. Let me think: the ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So, the H's on the ethyl group are on the same carbon as the CH group, so maybe they're vicinal (next to) the H's on the adjacent carbon.

But vicinal coupling is possible, but it's typically weaker and might not be observed as clearly. If that's the case, the H's on carbon 2 would be coupled with not only the H's on carbon 1 but also the H's on the ethyl group of carbon 2. But wait, the ethyl group is on carbon 2, so the H's on the ethyl would be on the same carbon as the CH, so they're not adjacent to the H's on carbon 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the splitting again.

The key is that each H is coupled with three different sets of H's. So, perhaps the structure has a CH group surrounded by three different types of H's.

Looking at option B: the H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to CH2 (carbon 2) and CH(CH3) (carbon 4). But in option B, the substituents are ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, the H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to CH2 (carbon 2) and CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 4). So, each H on carbon 3 would be coupled with 2H (CH2) and 2H (CH(CH2CH3)), leading to a triplet of triplets. That could fit the description.

Meanwhile, the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) are adjacent to CH3 (carbon 1) and CH(CH2CH3) (carbon 3). So, the H's on carbon 2 would be coupled with 3H (CH3, quartet) and 2H (CH(CH2CH3), triplet), leading to a quartet of triplets, which is a triplet of quartets.

So, in this structure, the H's on carbon 2 would show a triplet of quartets, and the H's on carbon 3 would show a triplet of triplets. But the question says one is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Not exactly matching, but perhaps the H's on carbon 3 have another coupling. Wait, the ethyl groups on carbon 3 and 4 are CH2CH3. So, the H's on the ethyl group (CH2) are on the same carbon as the CH group. So, the H's on the ethyl group are adjacent to the H's on the CH group of carbon 3. That would add another coupling.

So, the H's on the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would be coupled with the H's on carbon 3's CH group. So, the H's on the ethyl (CH2) would each be adjacent to the CH group, leading to a split. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A, where the H's on carbon 2 are coupled with three different groups.

Wait, in option A, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (3H → quartet).

- Carbon 3: CH (2H → triplet).

- The ethyl group on carbon 2: the CH2CH3 has three H's on the adjacent CH2. Would the H's on carbon 2's CH group couple with the H's on the ethyl group's CH2? Like, the H's on carbon 2's CH would be next to the ethyl's CH2, so vicinal coupling. So, that would add another split.

If that's the case, the H's on carbon 2 would be coupled with three groups: 3H (quartet), 2H (triplet), and another 2H (triplet from the ethyl's CH2). So, the splitting would be a quartet of triplets of triplets, which could fit the description of a doublet of triplets of quartets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of unique H environments.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The H's on carbons 2 and 3 are equivalent due to symmetry, so two signals from those CH groups. The CH3 on carbon 1, the CH2 on carbon 4, and the COOH. So total of four signals, perhaps. But the question mentions several peaks, so this might fit.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

H's on carbons 3 and 4 are equivalent, leading to two signals. Plus CH3, CH2, and COOH. So again, four signals.

But the question mentions that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps the structure has two different H environments that exhibit such complex splitting.

Hmm. It's a bit challenging, but I think the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, considering the IR data:

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 (C=O). All options have a COOH group, so that's consistent.

The NMR has no vinyl H's, which is correct for all options.

The splitting patterns suggest multiple couplings, which likely come from a structure where a CH group is flanked by two other CH groups, each with their own substituents.

After thinking through all options, I'm leaning towards option A being the correct answer because the substituents on carbons 2 and 3 are ethyl groups, which would lead to more complex splitting due to the possibility of coupling with the ethyl groups' H's. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option D might be the same as B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake in the options. Option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which is the same as option B. So that can't be right. So I must have misread the options. Let me check again.

Ah, no, the options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

So, options B and D are different. B has C2H5 substituents on carbons 3 and 4, while D has CH3 substituents.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

So, structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, option D's substituents on carbons 3 and 4 are methyl groups, while option B's are ethyl.

In this case, the H's on carbon 3 in option D would be adjacent to CH2 (carbon 2) and CH(CH3) (carbon 4).

So, the H's on carbon 3 in D would be split by 2H (CH2) → triplet and 2H (CH(CH3)) → triplet. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Similarly, the H's on carbon 2 (CH2) would be adjacent to CH3 (3H → quartet) and CH(CH3) (2H → triplet), leading to a quartet of triplets.

So, in option D, the H's on carbon 2 would show a quartet of triplets, and the H's on carbon 3 would show a triplet of triplets.

This matches the description of one signal being a doublet of triplets of quartets (perhaps quartet of triplets is equivalent) and another being a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, the quartet of triplets would be a doublet of triplets of quartets if another coupling is present. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the H's on carbon 3 in option D are also coupled with the H's on carbon 4. But since the substituents are methyl, which are on the same carbon, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A because the ethyl groups would introduce more coupling partners.

In option A, the H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to CH3 (3H), CH (2H), and the ethyl group's CH2 (2H). So, each H on carbon 2 would be coupled with three groups: 3H, 2H, and 2H. So the splitting would be a quartet (3H) multiplied by triplet (2H) multiplied by triplet (2H), leading to a quartet of triplets of triplets, which is a doublet of triplets of quartets if the order is different.

But I'm not sure about the exact terminology. The question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would imply the splitting occurs in that order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's the only one with ethyl groups, which would have more complex coupling due to the CH2CH3 substituents.

But I'm not entirely confident. After all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR spectrum lacks vinyl hydrogens, indicating no double bonds. Additionally, two complex splitting patterns are observed: a doublet of triplets of quartets (DTq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (DTt). The task is to match these observations with one of the given compounds.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- Structure: CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.
- The molecule is symmetric, with methyl groups on carbons 3 and 4.
- **¹H NMR Analysis**:
  - The H's on carbon 2 are adjacent to:
    - CH₃ (3H, quartet).
    - CH(CH₃) (2H, triplet).
  - This results in a quartet of triplets, which does not fully match the described splitting patterns.
  - The H's on carbon 3 are adjacent to:
    - CH₂ (2H, triplet).
    - CH(CH₃) (2H, triplet).
  - This results in a triplet of triplets, which also does not fully match the described splitting patterns.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fully match the observed splitting patterns.

### Final Conclusion:
Option A is the only structure that matches the observed splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR spectrum, where the H's on carbon 2 exhibit a doublet of triplets of quartets due to coupling with CH₃, CH, and the ethyl group's CH₂. The FTIR data is consistent with all options, but the unique splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum strongly support Option A as the correct answer.

**Answer: A**
