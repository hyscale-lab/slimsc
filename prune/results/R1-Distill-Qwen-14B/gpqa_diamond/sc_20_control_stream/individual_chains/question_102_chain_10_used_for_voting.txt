Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The person created a bicistronic vector, which means it has two coding regions in one construct. The vector has lox sites and stop cassettes, which I think are used for conditional expression.

So the setup is that the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which usually allows for internal ribosome entry site, so it can be expressed after the first gene if the IRES is functional.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. That means that unless Cre is present to excise the loxP sites, the mCherry won't be expressed because of the stop cassette. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between it and eGFP. So for the receptor to be expressed, the Cre would need to act on those lox2272 sites.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe the idea is that Cre is used to excise parts of the construct. But in this case, the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre mice. So when they breed the mice with this construct to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the appropriate lox sites.

Hmm, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre.

Now, after the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal. Green would be from eGFP, which is on the receptor. But they don't see any green signal. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression, so this might not explain why eGFP isn't showing up.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If that's the case, maybe it's not expressed on the surface, but the Western blot would still show the protein. The question says they did a Western and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the receptor wasn't properly trafficked, would it show up? Maybe, but I'm not sure if the Western would detect it or if it's a processing issue.

C) Enhancer missing. The construct has the CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. If an enhancer is missing, maybe the receptors aren't expressed. But CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the stop cassettes are between the ORF and the fluorescent proteins. So the ligand is ligand::mCherry (but with a loxP stop), and the receptor is receptor::eGFP, with a lox2272 stop. So for the receptor to express eGFP, the lox2272 stop must be excised.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic, so the two cassettes are in a way that perhaps the Cre is needed to remove the stops. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (because the CBA promoter is strong), but mCherry would be blocked by the loxP stop. Similarly, the receptor would have the IRES, so maybe the receptor could be expressed without Cre, but the eGFP would be blocked.

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, which is from the SOX10-Cre mice, the lox sites would be excised.

Wait, the construct is in the mouse, so the Cre would be expressed in specific tissues, like where SOX10 is active. So in the offspring, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites in the right places.

But in the vector, the ligand is at 5', with the stop before mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with stop before eGFP.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, so perhaps the receptor is only expressed if the IRES is functional, which typically allows the ribosome to continue translating after the first ORF. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would be blocked. The receptor would be expressed (from the IRES), but eGFP would be blocked by the stop.

But when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So the ligand would now be followed by mCherry, so you'd get ligand-mCherry fusion, and the receptor would have eGFP.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning they could detect the proteins. But after transfection to primary astrocytes, maybe the construct is expressed correctly. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression is not happening as intended.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles have this. Then crossed to SOX10-Cre (hemizygous), which would lead their offspring to have SOX10-Cre.

SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells, perhaps.

So the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. So in the construct, the loxP is between the ligand and mCherry, so excising that would let the ligand be followed by mCherry. Similarly, the lox2272 is between receptor and eGFP, so excising that would let the receptor be followed by eGFP.

But in the offspring, when they look for eGFP, they don't see any green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again:

A) Paracrine: Not directly related to expression, more about function.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi: If it's stuck, it wouldn't be on the surface, but the Western blot would still show the protein. Since the question says the Western blot works (they see signals), but in the mouse, no eGFP. So maybe the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed.

C) Enhancer missing: If the promoter isn't sufficient, the proteins aren't made. But the CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps for the ligand. But the receptor is under IRES, so maybe the IRES isn't working. But the question says that the vector was designed with the receptor under IRES. Maybe the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then, why would the construct not express the receptor?

Wait, the vector is designed such that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES element, which is used for internal ribosome entry. So the idea is that the ribosome translates the ligand, then perhaps the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor. But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor won't be expressed.

But the design of the vector is bicistronic, which relies on the IRES to allow the second gene to be expressed. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor won't be expressed, hence no eGFP.

But wait, if the lox2272-stop is present, then the eGFP is not expressed unless the stop is removed. So in the absence of Cre, the eGFP is blocked. But when Cre is present, it should remove the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre, which would provide Cre in the offspring. So the Cre should excise the stops, allowing both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But the result is no green signal, so no eGFP. Why?

Another possibility is that the IRES doesn't function properly, so even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't expressed because the IRES doesn't drive its translation. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the receptor isn't being made.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so the Western blot would have detected the proteins. If the construct isn't properly expressed in the mouse, the Western would not show the bands, but the question says they do. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed as intended.

Wait, another angle: the eGFP is attached to the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop cassette isn't properly excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But Cre is present, so the stops should be excised.

Wait, the lox2272 sites... If the Cre isn't recognizing the lox2272 sites, then the stop cassette wouldn't be excised. So the eGFP remains blocked.

But why wouldn't Cre recognize lox2272? Oh! Because the standard Cre used in mice typically recognizes loxP sites, not lox2272. Lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre with a certain mutation, like the Dre recombinase or something. Or perhaps the Cre used doesn't target lox2272.

Wait, the construct uses loxP and lox2272. If the Cre is wild-type, it might not act on lox2272. So the lox2272-stop would remain, blocking eGFP expression.

So in the vector, the ligand has a loxP-stop, which would be excised by wild-type Cre, letting mCherry be expressed. The receptor has a lox2272-stop, which would require a different Cre (like Dre) to excise. If the Cre from SOX10-Cre is wild-type, it can't cut lox2272 sites, so the stop remains for the receptor-eGFP.

So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop isn't excised, so the GFP isn't made. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, leading to a nonfunctional protein, but if the stop is removed, the protein would be expressed but not functional. But the Western blot would still show the receptor (since the antibody is against the overexpressed proteins, perhaps the receptor itself is present, but without GFP).

Alternatively, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised, so the construct is not allowing eGFP expression.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, so it would be expressed. But mCherry is behind the loxP-stop, so only when Cre excises would mCherry be expressed. The receptor is after IRES, so in the absence of Cre, the stop prevents eGFP. But with Cre, only the loxP is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the lox2272 isn't removed because Cre can't cut that, so eGFP remains blocked.

So the mouse would express the ligand, but mCherry is only expressed when loxP is cut, which it is. But the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut, so the stop remains.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the lox2272 isn't being cut, so the stop remains, blocking eGFP.

So looking at the options, none of them directly state that, but perhaps option D is about the eGFP not being expressed because the stop isn't removed, leading the eGFP not to be in frame. Alternatively, the construct may have the eGFP not in frame with the receptor.

Wait, no. The construct has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP, but with a stop in between. So the eGFP is downstream of the stop. So if the stop is there, the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. Without the stop, the eGFP would be expressed.

If the Cre can't excise the stop (because it's a lox2272 site and Cre can't cleave it), then the eGFP won't be expressed. But in the question, the construct is in the mouse model, which had the Cre from the SOX10-Cre.

So the mouse should have the Cre, but if that Cre can't cut the lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, none of them directly address the lox2272 issue. So perhaps another angle.

Another possibility: the IRES isn't functional. So the receptor isn't being expressed at all, regardless of the stop cassette. So even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't made, so eGFP isn't made.

But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor would not be expressed. But the Western blot would have shown the receptor if the antibody targets it.

Wait, the user says that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin loading. So the blot can detect the proteins. So if the construct isn't expressed, the signal would be low or absent. But the question says that the signal is proportional, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, but in a way that it's not in frame. For example, if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is excised, the eGFP is in frame. If it's not, perhaps they're out of frame, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional eGFP. But that would require that the stop is excised incorrectly, which I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two cassettes are misarranged, so the Cre isn't acting correctly.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at 5', followed by a loxP stop. The receptor is at 3', with a lox2272 stop before eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not. The receptor is expressed via IRES, but eGFP is blocked.

When Cre is present, it should excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. The loxP site is upstream of mCherry, so excision would allow the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. The lox2272 is upstream of eGFP, so the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed.

But if the Cre can't excise the lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So why would that happen? Because the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272.

So in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. Wild-type Cre doesn't cut lox2272. Therefore, the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the mouse's receptor isn't fused to eGFP, so no green signal.

Looking back at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would imply a frameshift, but the issue here is that the stop isn't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed, not a frame issue.

Option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES. So the promoters are present.

So perhaps the answer is that the stop cassette isn't excised because the Cre can't act on the lox2272 sites. But this scenario isn't directly covered in the options.

Looking again, the options don't mention anything about the loxP or lox2272. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Another thought: the vector is designed to allow for the expression of both proteins, but perhaps the IRES isn't functional. If the IRES isn't working, then the receptor isn't expressed, regardless of the stop cassette. So even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't made, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in that case, the Western blot would show the ligand but not the receptor. But the question says, "the signal is proportional to the actin loading." So I think both proteins are being expressed when transfected into the cells. Or perhaps not?

Wait, after plasmid transfection, which would be in vitro, the construct would be expressed. If the IRES is functional, then both ligand and receptor are expressed. But when they made the mouse model, they used the construct in the genome, so maybe it's under different regulatory conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not expressed because the construct isn't correctly placed. For instance, the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor because of the way the stop cassette is arranged.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed but not in the right compartment.

Wait, the question says that the confocal is used, which is for imaging live cells or fixed cells with fluorescent markers. If the eGFP is expressed but in the cytoplasm, the signal might not be strong. But the absence of any green suggests it's not expressed.

Let me go back to the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could be a problem. If the eGFP is not in frame, the protein would be truncated or not produced, but the Western would still show the receptor if the antibody is against the receptor. But in the question, the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins, which could be either or both.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised, but the receptor is. So the Western would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, so I'm not sure if that implies both are being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is on the same transcript but not translated, but that's not likely with the setup.

Another possibility is that the IRES is not functional in the construct, so the receptor isn't being expressed. So even if the stop is excised, the receptor isn't made, so eGFP isn't either.

But why would the IRES not be functional? The construct was designed with it. Maybe in the vector, the IRES isn't correctly positioned after the first gene.

Wait, bicistronic constructs often use IRES elements to allow the second gene to be expressed. But if the IRES isn't functional, the second gene (receptor) won't be expressed. So in the mouse, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, and thus eGFP wouldn't be either.

But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor won't be expressed. But then the Western blot would show ligand, but not receptor. However, the question says the blot showed signals proportional to actin, which suggests both proteins are expressed. Or perhaps the blot was only for one of them.

Wait, the question says that after transfection, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw signals proportional to actin. So maybe the Western blot showed that the ligand is expressed, but not the receptor. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the receptor isn't, and the receptors aren't expressed because of the IRES not working.

But the question doesn't give information about the expression of the receptor in the mouse. It only says that the confocal didn't show green.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP and receptor are not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the eGFP is not correctly expressed, leading to no fluorescent signal. But that would require that the excision leads to a frameshift, which is not likely if the excision is done correctly.

Wait, the construct has the receptor ORF followed by a stop, then eGFP. When the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame, leading to a fusion protein. If the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in this case, the Cre isn't removing the stop because it's a lox2272 site.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. It can't cut lox2272. Therefore, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop isn't excised, so the eGFP is not being expressed. But the question is why.

Looking at the options, perhaps none directly address this, but the closest would be option D, which says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's more about the genetic construct's design, not the expression.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IRES is only functional when certain conditions are met, like a specific cell type or presence of certain factors. If the IRES isn't active in the cells being examined, then the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the question says the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which targets neural crest cells. If the IRES is active in those cells, it should express the receptor.

But this is getting a bit too deep without a clear answer. Let me think of the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If they're not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But if the stop is present, then eGFP isn't made. If the stop is excised, but the eGFP is out of frame, then it's not made. But without the stop, it would be in frame.

But in this case, the stop isn't excised (because Cre isn't cutting lox2272), so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless. So D might not be the reason.

Alternatively, the lox2272 is a different strain of Cre, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is under the control of the IRES, but the IRES is not functional because it's placed incorrectly. So the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the Western blot would still show the ligand, but not the receptor. But the question says after transfection, they detected proteins, so maybe both are made in culture, but not in the mouse.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is only functional in certain species or under certain conditions. Maybe in mice, the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't expressed. So even with the stop excised, the receptor isn't made, so no eGFP.

Hmm, but I think the IRES is a mammalian construct, so it should work in mice.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the ligand is being expressed, but the receptor isn't because the IRES isn't working. But then in the Western, the receptor wouldn't be present, but the question says the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests both are expressed.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of the possible reasons why eGFP isn't expressed.

The most likely reason, given the setup, is that the stop cassette isn't being excised because the Cre can't recognize the lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal in the confocal. This isn't directly listed in the options, but perhaps the answer is D, which suggests that the eGFP isn't correctly expressed because the frames are off.

Alternatively, the answer could be option D, as the receptor and eGFP need to be in the same reading frame for eGFP to be expressed. But if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's not the same as not being in frame.

Wait, perhaps the design of the construct has the eGFP in a different frame. For example, if the stop is before eGFP, and the lox2272 excision doesn't correctly splice the eGFP into the same frame as the receptor. Then, even if the stop is excised, the eGFP might not be expressed correctly.

But that would require a frameshift, which isn't the case if the stop is correctly excised.

I think I'm stuck here. Based on the options given, the most plausible answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, another possibility is that the eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 isn't excised, which isn't directly an option. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) block expression of mCherry and eGFP, respectively, unless Cre recombinase excises these sites. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which provide Cre expression in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the question focuses on the lack of eGFP expression, which is unrelated to the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. This option does not explain the absence of eGFP.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it might fail to reach the cell surface, but the Western blot would still detect the protein. The question states that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the proteins are being expressed. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP signal.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing or non-functional. This option is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   For eGFP to be expressed, the stop cassette upstream of eGFP must be excised by Cre. The construct uses lox2272 sites, which require a specific Cre variant (e.g., Dre) for excision. Wild-type Cre, such as that provided by SOX10-Cre mice, cannot excise lox2272 sites. As a result, the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation of no green signal in the confocal microscopy. While the phrasing of this option does not explicitly mention lox2272, it is the most plausible explanation among the given choices.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP expression is due to the inability of wild-type Cre (from SOX10-Cre mice) to excise the lox2272-stop cassette, preventing eGFP from being expressed. This issue is best captured by **Option D**, as it indirectly relates to the failure of proper expression due to a lack of alignment between the construct and the Cre system used.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The person created a bicistronic vector, which means it has two coding regions in one construct. The vector has lox sites and stop cassettes, which I think are used for conditional expression.

So the setup is that the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which usually allows for internal ribosome entry site, so it can be expressed after the first gene if the IRES is functional.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. That means that unless Cre is present to excise the loxP sites, the mCherry won't be expressed because of the stop cassette. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between it and eGFP. So for the receptor to be expressed, the Cre would need to act on those lox2272 sites.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe the idea is that Cre is used to excise parts of the construct. But in this case, the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre mice. So when they breed the mice with this construct to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the appropriate lox sites.

Hmm, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre.

Now, after the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal. Green would be from eGFP, which is on the receptor. But they don't see any green signal. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression, so this might not explain why eGFP isn't showing up.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If that's the case, maybe it's not expressed on the surface, but the Western blot would still show the protein. The question says they did a Western and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the receptor wasn't properly trafficked, would it show up? Maybe, but I'm not sure if the Western would detect it or if it's a processing issue.

C) Enhancer missing. The construct has the CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. If an enhancer is missing, maybe the receptors aren't expressed. But CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the stop cassettes are between the ORF and the fluorescent proteins. So the ligand is ligand::mCherry (but with a loxP stop), and the receptor is receptor::eGFP, with a lox2272 stop. So for the receptor to express eGFP, the lox2272 stop must be excised.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic, so the two cassettes are in a way that perhaps the Cre is needed to remove the stops. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (because the CBA promoter is strong), but mCherry would be blocked by the loxP stop. Similarly, the receptor would have the IRES, so maybe the receptor could be expressed without Cre, but the eGFP would be blocked.

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, which is from the SOX10-Cre mice, the lox sites would be excised.

Wait, the construct is in the mouse, so the Cre would be expressed in specific tissues, like where SOX10 is active. So in the offspring, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites in the right places.

But in the vector, the ligand is at 5', with the stop before mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with stop before eGFP.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, so perhaps the receptor is only expressed if the IRES is functional, which typically allows the ribosome to continue translating after the first ORF. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would be blocked. The receptor would be expressed (from the IRES), but eGFP would be blocked by the stop.

But when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So the ligand would now be followed by mCherry, so you'd get ligand-mCherry fusion, and the receptor would have eGFP.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning they could detect the proteins. But after transfection to primary astrocytes, maybe the construct is expressed correctly. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression is not happening as intended.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles have this. Then crossed to SOX10-Cre (hemizygous), which would lead their offspring to have SOX10-Cre.

SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells, perhaps.

So the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. So in the construct, the loxP is between the ligand and mCherry, so excising that would let the ligand be followed by mCherry. Similarly, the lox2272 is between receptor and eGFP, so excising that would let the receptor be followed by eGFP.

But in the offspring, when they look for eGFP, they don't see any green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again:

But the receptor is under IRES, so maybe the IRES isn't working. But the question says that the vector was designed with the receptor under IRES. Maybe the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then, why would the construct not express the receptor?

Wait, the vector is designed such that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES element, which is used for internal ribosome entry. So the idea is that the ribosome translates the ligand, then perhaps the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor. But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor won't be expressed.

But the design of the vector is bicistronic, which relies on the IRES to allow the second gene to be expressed. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor won't be expressed, hence no eGFP.

But wait, if the lox2272-stop is present, then the eGFP is not expressed unless the stop is removed. So in the absence of Cre, the eGFP is blocked. But when Cre is present, it should remove the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre, which would provide Cre in the offspring. So the Cre should excise the stops, allowing both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But the result is no green signal, so no eGFP. Why?

Another possibility is that the IRES doesn't function properly, so even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't expressed because the IRES doesn't drive its translation. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the receptor isn't being made.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so the Western blot would have detected the proteins. If the construct isn't properly expressed in the mouse, the Western would not show the bands, but the question says they do. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed as intended.

Wait, another angle: the eGFP is attached to the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop cassette isn't properly excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But Cre is present, so the stops should be excised.

Wait, the lox2272 sites... If the Cre isn't recognizing the lox2272 sites, then the stop cassette wouldn't be excised. So the eGFP remains blocked.

But why wouldn't Cre recognize lox2272? Oh! Because the standard Cre used in mice typically recognizes loxP sites, not lox2272. Lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre with a certain mutation, like the Dre recombinase or something. Or perhaps the Cre used doesn't target lox2272.

Wait, the construct uses loxP and lox2272. If the Cre is wild-type, it might not act on lox2272. So the lox2272-stop would remain, blocking eGFP expression.

So in the vector, the ligand has a loxP-stop, which would be excised by wild-type Cre, letting mCherry be expressed. The receptor has a lox2272-stop, which would require a different Cre (like Dre) to excise. If the Cre from SOX10-Cre is wild-type, it can't cut lox2272 sites, so the stop remains for the receptor-eGFP.

So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop isn't excised, so the GFP isn't made. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, leading to a nonfunctional protein, but if the stop is removed, the protein would be expressed but not functional. But the Western blot would still show the receptor (since the antibody is against the overexpressed proteins, perhaps the receptor itself is present, but without GFP).

Alternatively, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised, so the construct is not allowing eGFP expression.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, so it would be expressed. But mCherry is behind the loxP-stop, so only when Cre excises would mCherry be expressed. The receptor is after IRES, so in the absence of Cre, the stop prevents eGFP. But with Cre, only the loxP is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the lox2272 isn't removed because Cre can't cut that, so eGFP remains blocked.

So the mouse would express the ligand, but mCherry is only expressed when loxP is cut, which it is. But the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut, so the stop remains.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the lox2272 isn't being cut, so the stop remains, blocking eGFP.

So looking at the options, none of them directly state that, but perhaps option D is about the eGFP not being expressed because the stop isn't removed, leading the eGFP not to be in frame. Alternatively, the construct may have the eGFP not in frame with the receptor.

Wait, no. The construct has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP, but with a stop in between. So the eGFP is downstream of the stop. So if the stop is there, the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. Without the stop, the eGFP would be expressed.

If the Cre can't excise the stop (because it's a lox2272 site and Cre can't cleave it), then the eGFP won't be expressed. But in the question, the construct is in the mouse model, which had the Cre from the SOX10-Cre.

So the mouse should have the Cre, but if that Cre can't cut the lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, none of them directly address the lox2272 issue. So perhaps another angle.

Another possibility: the IRES isn't functional. So the receptor isn't being expressed at all, regardless of the stop cassette. So even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't made, so eGFP isn't made.

But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor would not be expressed. But the Western blot would have shown the receptor if the antibody targets it.

Wait, the user says that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin loading. So the blot can detect the proteins. So if the construct isn't expressed, the signal would be low or absent. But the question says that the signal is proportional, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, but in a way that it's not in frame. For example, if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is excised, the eGFP is in frame. If it's not, perhaps they're out of frame, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional eGFP. But that would require that the stop is excised incorrectly, which I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two cassettes are misarranged, so the Cre isn't acting correctly.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at 5', followed by a loxP stop. The receptor is at 3', with a lox2272 stop before eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not. The receptor is expressed via IRES, but eGFP is blocked.

When Cre is present, it should excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. The loxP site is upstream of mCherry, so excision would allow the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. The lox2272 is upstream of eGFP, so the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed.

But if the Cre can't excise the lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So why would that happen? Because the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272.

So in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. Wild-type Cre doesn't cut lox2272. Therefore, the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the mouse's receptor isn't fused to eGFP, so no green signal.

Looking back at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would imply a frameshift, but the issue here is that the stop isn't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed, not a frame issue.

Option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES. So the promoters are present.

So perhaps the answer is that the stop cassette isn't excised because the Cre can't act on the lox2272 sites. But this scenario isn't directly covered in the options.

Looking again, the options don't mention anything about the loxP or lox2272. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Another thought: the vector is designed to allow for the expression of both proteins, but perhaps the IRES isn't functional. If the IRES isn't working, then the receptor isn't expressed, regardless of the stop cassette. So even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't made, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in that case, the Western blot would show the ligand but not the receptor. But the question says, "the signal is proportional to the actin loading." So I think both proteins are being expressed when transfected into the cells. Or perhaps not?

Wait, after plasmid transfection, which would be in vitro, the construct would be expressed. If the IRES is functional, then both ligand and receptor are expressed. But when they made the mouse model, they used the construct in the genome, so maybe it's under different regulatory conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not expressed because the construct isn't correctly placed. For instance, the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor because of the way the stop cassette is arranged.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed but not in the right compartment.

Wait, the question says that the confocal is used, which is for imaging live cells or fixed cells with fluorescent markers. If the eGFP is expressed but in the cytoplasm, the signal might not be strong. But the absence of any green suggests it's not expressed.

Let me go back to the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could be a problem. If the eGFP is not in frame, the protein would be truncated or not produced, but the Western would still show the receptor if the antibody is against the receptor. But in the question, the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins, which could be either or both.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised, but the receptor is. So the Western would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, so I'm not sure if that implies both are being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is on the same transcript but not translated, but that's not likely with the setup.

Another possibility is that the IRES is not functional in the construct, so the receptor isn't being expressed. So even if the stop is excised, the receptor isn't made, so eGFP isn't either.

But why would the IRES not be functional? The construct was designed with it. Maybe in the vector, the IRES isn't correctly positioned after the first gene.

Wait, bicistronic constructs often use IRES elements to allow the second gene to be expressed. But if the IRES isn't functional, the second gene (receptor) won't be expressed. So in the mouse, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, and thus eGFP wouldn't be either.

But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor won't be expressed. But then the Western blot would show ligand, but not receptor. However, the question says the blot showed signals proportional to actin, which suggests both proteins are expressed. Or perhaps the blot was only for one of them.

Wait, the question says that after transfection, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw signals proportional to actin. So maybe the Western blot showed that the ligand is expressed, but not the receptor. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the receptor isn't, and the receptors aren't expressed because of the IRES not working.

But the question doesn't give information about the expression of the receptor in the mouse. It only says that the confocal didn't show green.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP and receptor are not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the eGFP is not correctly expressed, leading to no fluorescent signal. But that would require that the excision leads to a frameshift, which is not likely if the excision is done correctly.

Wait, the construct has the receptor ORF followed by a stop, then eGFP. When the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame, leading to a fusion protein. If the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in this case, the Cre isn't removing the stop because it's a lox2272 site.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. It can't cut lox2272. Therefore, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop isn't excised, so the eGFP is not being expressed. But the question is why.

Looking at the options, perhaps none directly address this, but the closest would be option D, which says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's more about the genetic construct's design, not the expression.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IRES is only functional when certain conditions are met, like a specific cell type or presence of certain factors. If the IRES isn't active in the cells being examined, then the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the question says the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which targets neural crest cells. If the IRES is active in those cells, it should express the receptor.

But this is getting a bit too deep without a clear answer. Let me think of the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If they're not, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But if the stop is present, then eGFP isn't made. If the stop is excised, but the eGFP is out of frame, then it's not made. But without the stop, it would be in frame.

But in this case, the stop isn't excised (because Cre isn't cutting lox2272), so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless. So D might not be the reason.

Alternatively, the lox2272 is a different strain of Cre, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is under the control of the IRES, but the IRES is not functional because it's placed incorrectly. So the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the Western blot would still show the ligand, but not the receptor. But the question says after transfection, they detected proteins, so maybe both are made in culture, but not in the mouse.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is only functional in certain species or under certain conditions. Maybe in mice, the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't expressed. So even with the stop excised, the receptor isn't made, so no eGFP.

Hmm, but I think the IRES is a mammalian construct, so it should work in mice.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the ligand is being expressed, but the receptor isn't because the IRES isn't working. But then in the Western, the receptor wouldn't be present, but the question says the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests both are expressed.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of the possible reasons why eGFP isn't expressed.

The most likely reason, given the setup, is that the stop cassette isn't being excised because the Cre can't recognize the lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal in the confocal. This isn't directly listed in the options, but perhaps the answer is D, which suggests that the eGFP isn't correctly expressed because the frames are off.

Alternatively, the answer could be option D, as the receptor and eGFP need to be in the same reading frame for eGFP to be expressed. But if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's not the same as not being in frame.

Wait, perhaps the design of the construct has the eGFP in a different frame. For example, if the stop is before eGFP, and the lox2272 excision doesn't correctly splice the eGFP into the same frame as the receptor. Then, even if the stop is excised, the eGFP might not be expressed correctly.

But that would require a frameshift, which isn't the case if the stop is correctly excised.

I think I'm stuck here. Based on the options given, the most plausible answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, another possibility is that the eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 isn't excised, which isn't directly an option. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) block expression of mCherry and eGFP, respectively, unless Cre recombinase excises these sites. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which provide Cre expression in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the question focuses on the lack of eGFP expression, which is unrelated to the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. This option does not explain the absence of eGFP.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it might fail to reach the cell surface, but the Western blot would still detect the protein. The question states that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the proteins are being expressed. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP signal.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing or non-functional. This option is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   For eGFP to be expressed, the stop cassette upstream of eGFP must be excised by Cre. The construct uses lox2272 sites, which require a specific Cre variant (e.g., Dre) for excision. Wild-type Cre, such as that provided by SOX10-Cre mice, cannot excise lox2272 sites. As a result, the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation of no green signal in the confocal microscopy. While the phrasing of this option does not explicitly mention lox2272, it is the most plausible explanation among the given choices.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP expression is due to the inability of wild-type Cre (from SOX10-Cre mice) to excise the lox2272-stop cassette, preventing eGFP from being expressed. This issue is best captured by **Option D**, as it indirectly relates to the failure of proper expression due to a lack of alignment between the construct and the Cre system used.

**Answer: D**
