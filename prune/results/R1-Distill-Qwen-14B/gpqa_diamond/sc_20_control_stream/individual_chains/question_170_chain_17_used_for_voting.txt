Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a given spin state. Let me think through this step by step.

Hmm, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, that's a vector in the spin space. I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors since electrons have spin-1/2. So the state vector is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as <ψ| O |ψ>, where O is the operator. In this case, the operator is S_y, the spin in the y-direction. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. The spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. So σ_y is given as a matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

Wait, so S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. So the actual operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So to find <S_y>, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Let me write that out.

First, the state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose (bra) would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i), 4 ] because when you take the conjugate of 3i, it becomes -3i. Wait, actually, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? So the bra vector is [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, no. Wait, no, the original vector is [3i,4]^T. So the bra is [ (3i)*, (4)* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ] because 4 is real and its conjugate is itself. Oh wait, wait, no, 4 is real, so (4)* is 4. So the bra is [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, wait. Wait, no. The bra is the conjugate transpose. So the original vector is [3i,4]^T. The conjugate would be [ -3i, 4 ]^T, and then the transpose would make it a row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The state vector is a column vector: [3i; 4]. The conjugate would be [ -3i; 4 ] because you take the complex conjugate of each component. Then, the bra is the transpose of that, so it's a row vector: [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the original state is ψ = [3i;4] (a column vector). The conjugate transpose (bra) is ψ† which is [ (3i)*, (4)* ] as a row vector. Since (3i)* is -3i, and 4 is real, so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So, <S_y> = ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Wait, but S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, so I can factor that out. So it becomes (ħ/2) * ψ† σ_y ψ.

So to compute this, I need to calculate ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute σ_y multiplied by ψ first. So σ_y is:

0  -i
i   0

Multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4].

So matrix multiplication:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i
Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† multiplied by (σ_y ψ) is the dot product:

(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) 

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12
Second term: 4*(-3) = -12

So adding them, -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value would then be (ħ/2) * (-24).

Wait, that would give <S_y> = (ħ/2)(-24) = -12ħ.

But looking at the options, the options are fractions like 12ħ/25, etc. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the ψ or the multiplication steps. Let me go back.

Wait, the state vector is (3i, 4). So ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

Wait, when I multiply σ_y with ψ, let's do it again.

σ_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So the product σ_y ψ is:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.
Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So yes, σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the product ψ† (σ_y ψ) is:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.
Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options, none of them say -12ħ. The options are:

A) -12ħ/25
B)12ħ/25
C)25ħ/2
D)-25ħ/2

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, perhaps the state is not normalized. Because the expectation value calculation needs the state to be normalized. So I should check if the state vector is normalized.

The state vector is [3i,4]^T. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state would be (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

Wait, so maybe the given state is not normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually assumed to have a norm of 1. So perhaps the question expects us to normalize the state before computing the expectation value.

Oh, right! That's probably where I went wrong. Because if the state isn't normalized, the expectation value is not just <ψ|O|ψ>, but rather <O> = [ψ† O ψ] / [ψ† ψ].

So the correct approach is to compute [ψ† O ψ] divided by [ψ† ψ].

So let me recalculate.

First, compute the norm squared: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16=25. So the normalization factor is 1/25.

So the expectation value is (1/25) times the previous result.

Wait, wait. Let me redo it.

The expectation value is [ψ† S_y ψ] divided by [ψ† ψ].

So first compute ψ† σ_y ψ, which we found to be -24. Then multiply by (ħ/2), so that's (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

Then, divide by ψ† ψ, which is 25. So the expectation value is (-12 ħ) / 25.

So <S_y> = (-12 ħ) / 25.

Looking back at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, so the mistake was forgetting to normalize the state. Because the given state isn't normalized, and the expectation value is calculated using the normalized state. So I should have divided the result by the norm squared.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator \( S_y \) is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). To compute the expectation value, we first check if the state is normalized. The norm squared is:
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Since the norm is 5, the state is not normalized. The normalized state is \( \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger S_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), which is \( \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

5. **Normalization Factor**: The denominator \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) is the norm squared of \( \psi \), which is 25.

6. **Final Expectation Value**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\frac{\hbar}{2} (-24)}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option A.
