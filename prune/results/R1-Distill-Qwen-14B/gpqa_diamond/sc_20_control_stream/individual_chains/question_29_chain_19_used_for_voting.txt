Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound, and they've found the responsible gene which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the gene sequences.

The intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants are shown. The task is to find which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I'm assuming the gene is responsible for producing the compound, so a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would probably stop the compound from being made. So I'm looking for a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or disrupts the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants have changes in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant's sequence with the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'. Let me note the exact changes in each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing this to the wild type:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...
Mut1: ATG TTT CTA CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, wait, let me write the first part again. Maybe I should look at each position. Let's see, the wild type has a certain number of bases, and all the mutations are in the first exon area.

Looking at each position where the change occurs:

For Mutant 1, perhaps the sixth codon is different. Let me index the wild type:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
... and so on.

Mutant 1's sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Let me compare:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mut1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, maybe I got the reading wrong. Let me count.

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT
Mut1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT

Wait, so in wild type, the third codon is CTC (Leu). In Mutant 1, it's CTA (Leu again?), but wait, perhaps I'm looking at different positions.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the differences are. Let me look for the exact spot where the nucleotides change.

In the wild type, the sequence starts as ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So in the wild type, after the initial ATG, positions 4-6 are TTT (phenylalanine?), 7-9 CTC (leu), 10-12 GCT (Ala), etc.

In Mutant 1, positions 7-9 are CT A. Wait, no, perhaps I should compare each part step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the mutations occur in the DNA sequence.

The wild type is 5' ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA 3'

Mutant1: 5' ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA 3'

Compare the two:

Looking for where the letters differ. Let's write them out:

Wild: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T ... T G A

Mut1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ... T G A

So looking at each position:

Position 7: Wild has C, Mut1 has C? No, wait position 7 is the 7th nucleotide. Let me count:

The first part is the first 10 nucleotides for Wild:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G

Mutant1:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: A
10: C

Ah, so at position 9, Wild has C, Mutant1 has A.

So positions 7-9 in Wild: C T C (Leu), in Mutant1: C T A (Leu as well, since CT A is Leu too? Wait, CT A is actually CT A, which is codon CT A? Wait, no, position 7-9 in Wild is C T C (Leu), and in Mutant1, positions 7-9 are C T A (Leu again, because CT A is the same as CTA, which is Leu. Hmm, so that's a silent mutation perhaps.

Wait wait, but wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me write the first 20 nucleotides.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...
Mut1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in the third codon or a later one.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is a substitution that changes an amino acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which mutations cause a frameshift or a stop codon.

A frameshift would occur if the number of nucleotides is changed by insertions or deletions not in multiples of three, leading to a shift in the reading frame. But all the mutants have the same length as the wild type, so no insertions or deletions. Therefore, all mutations are substitutions.

So the question is which substitution would cause a premature stop codon or disrupt the protein structure.

Let me look at each mutant:

Wild Type: ... TGA ... (TGA is a stop codon, but that's at the end.)

Mutant 1: ... TGA, same as wild, but the sequence before might have a change.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 1: After ATG, the next codons are TTT, then CT A (so codon becomes CTA, which is Leu again). Then CGT (Arg), then GGT (Gly), etc. So perhaps it's a silent mutation or maybe not. But I don't see a stop codon here.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, let me compare the sequences. Let me write the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mut2: ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in the wild, position 7-9: CTC (Leu), position 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: GGT (Gly), 16-18: ACT (Thr), 19-21: TCT (Ser), etc.

In Mutant2, perhaps the 10-12 is AGC. Let's see:

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ... CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mut2: ... CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

Wait, perhaps my approach is confusing. Let me compare the sequences character by character.

Wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant2 starts with ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, let's look for the differences.

The first 10 nucleotides of wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AGC

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me write the first 30 letters.

Wild: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T ... T G A

Mutant2: A T G T T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ... T G A

So in Wild, positions 7-9 are C T C (Leu), position 10-12 G C T (Ala), 13-15 G G T (Gly), 16-18 A C T (Thr), etc.

In Mutant2, after the start and TTT, at position 7: C, 8: T, 9: A. So codon 3 (positions 7-9) is CTA (Leu).

Then position 10-12: A G C (Ser instead of Ala). So that's a substitution from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So that's an amino acid change from Ala to Ser. Not a stop codon yet.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 
Mut3: ATG TTT TT A CG C TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

So let me look for the differences.

Wild's first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut3's: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in the wild, positions 4-6 are TTT (Phe), positions 7-9 CTC (Leu), 10-12 GCT(Ala), 13-15 GGT (Gly), 16-18 ACT (Thr), 19-21 TCT (Ser), 22-24 GTG (Val), etc.

In Mut3:

Positions 4-6: TTT (same as wild)
Positions 7-9: TTA (Leu)
Position 10-12: CGC (Arg)
Positions 13-15: TGG (Trp)
Positions 16-18: TCA (Ser)
Etc.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations are. Let me compare each position.

At the beginning:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mut3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC...

So in Wild, after ATG TTT, comes CTC. Mut3 has TTA instead. So starting from position 7, Wild is CTC (Leu), Mut3 is TTA (Leu). So that's same amino acid.

Then, Wild's next codon is GCT (Ala), in Mut3, it's CGC (Arg). So that's a change from Ala to Arg. Then Wild's next codon is GGT (Gly), Mut3 has TGG (Trp). So Gly to Trp. Then Wild's next codon is ACT (Thr), Mut3 has TCA (Ser). So Thr to Ser.

So several amino acid changes, but no stop codon.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mut4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So Wild's first part:

...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4's:

...CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in Mut4:

After ATG TTT, comes TTA (Leu). Then CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), then TTCTGTG.

Looking at the wild, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mut4, let's see the changes:

At position 7: Wild is CTC (Leu), Mut4 is TTA (Leu). So same amino acid.

Position 10-12: Wild is GCT (Ala), Mut4 is CGC (Arg). So change from Ala to Arg.

Position 13-15: Wild is GGT (Gly), Mut4 is TAC (Tyr).

Hmm. So in the middle of the sequence, the codons change.

Wait, wait, looking at Mut4's sequence, in the middle, after TAC, the next is TTCTGTG.

Let me write the entire first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in Mut4, after TAC, comes T T C T G T G.

Wait, so the sequence after TAC is TTCTGTG. Let's see:

TAC is position 13-15. Then, next codon would be TT C (but that's not possible because it's T T C T G T G. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of nucleotides.

Looking at the exact sequence:

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4: ...CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the sequence of Mut4 is:

After ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC, then comes TTCTGTG.

So, the sequence is TTCTGTG. Let's break this into codons:

TT C T G T G ?

Wait, perhaps the actual sequence is T T C T G T G.

Breaking into triplets:

TT C (that can't be right because that's a 3-mer: T T C is Ser. Then T G T is Cys, then G is leftover but that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe I'm not breaking it correctly. Let's think about the exact letters.

Looking at Mut4's sequence: ...TAC TTCTGTG...

The TAC is the 13-15 positions, then the next part is TTCTGTG.

So that's T T C T G T G.

In triplets, that's T T C | T G T | G... but the G at the end would be part of the next codon. Wait, but that's 7 nucleotides after TAC, so that's not a multiple of 3. Wait, no, perhaps the sequence is longer.

Wait, perhaps the entire sequence is:

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4: ...CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, in Mut4, the portion from position 13 onward is CGC TAC T T C T G T G GAT...

So, let's see, the codons are:

CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly)... Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether any of the mutations introduce a stop codon.

A stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. Let's see if any of the mutations introduce that.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild type ends with ...TGA (which is a stop codon, as in the last part TGA).

In Mutant1: ...TGA as well, but not sure about the middle.

Mutant2: ...TGA.

Mutant3: ...TGA.

Mutant4: ...TGA.

Wait, but maybe the mutations are in the middle, causing a stop earlier.

Wait, let me check each mutant for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ... TAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

So, the part TTCTGTG is T T C T G T G.

Wait, the triplet TAC would be positions 13-15: TAC (Tyr). Then positions 16-18: T T C (Ser). 19-21: T G T (Cys). 22-24: G G A (Gly). Hmm, no stop codons here.

Looking at Mutant3's sequence: ... TAC GCT GGT GT CAC...

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Mut4's DNA sequence (after the start) is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC UUC UGT GGA... (since DNA is 5' to 3', mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand, but for the coding strand, it's same as DNA but T→U.)

Wait, maybe I should think in mRNA terms. Let me get the mRNA for each mutant and check for stop codons.

Wild type mRNA starts with AUG UUU UUC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... UGA.

So the wild type has a stop codon at the end (UGA).

Mutant1's mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... UGA.

So, in Mutant1, any stop codons before the end? Let's see:

Looking at the mRNA sequence of Mutant1: AUG UUU UUC UAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... UGA.

Looking for UAA, UAG, UGA. The last codon is UGA (stop). Any others? Before that, the sequence seems normal. So no premature stop.

Mutant2's mRNA:

AUG UUU UUC UAC AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

Again, checking for any UAA, UAG, UGA:

No, the only stop is at the end.

Mutant3's mRNA:

AUG UUU UUC UAA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

Wait, looking at Mutant3's mRNA: the first few codons are AUG UUU UUC UAA ... So after the initial Met Phe Phe, the next codon is UAA, which is a stop codon. Oh! So in Mutant3, there's a UAA at positions 10-12 of the mRNA (which correspond to the DNA positions where the mutation occurred).

So that would cause a premature stop codon. If the gene is disrupted early, the protein would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme that can't produce the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant4's mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

Wait, same as Mutant3? Or did I get it wrong.

Wait, the DNA for Mutant4 is: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UAC TTTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

So, the codon after UUU UUC is UAA. So again, same as Mutant3, having a stop codon early.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. Let me break down the DNA sequences into codons.

Wild type: 5’ ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT ... TGA 3’.

So each group of three is a codon.

Mutant3: 5’ ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... TGA 3’.

So the codons are:

ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC( Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTCTGTG (wait, that's 7 nucleotides, which can't be right. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait: the entire sequence is ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

Wait, maybe the TTCTGTG is actually split into T T C TGT G (but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps it's a longer sequence. Let me recount.

In Mutant3:

The DNA after TTA CGC is TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, the codons would be:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), T T C T G T G (22-28? That can't be right. Wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire sequence in triplets.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

So, the first few codons are:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), TT C T G T G (22-28? That doesn't make sense). Wait, perhaps the TTCTGTG is part of the same codon? Maybe I'm not breaking it down correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any in-frame stop codons in the mRNA.

Mutant3's DNA sequence: ...TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA would be:

...TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT... → but mRNA is complementary and in the same direction, but T becomes U. So the mRNA would have ...TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT... → which becomes ...UUU GGC AC CAC CTTCTGTG GAT... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the DNA sequence of Mutant3 is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, let's break that into codons:

AUG (1-3), UUU (4-6), UUA (7-9), CGG (10-12), UGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), CUU (22-24), CTG (25-27), TGG (28-30), AT... (but AT is just two letters, so perhaps I'm missing something).

Wait, but looking at codon 7-9 in the mRNA: UUA (Leu). Then CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc. No stop codons yet.

Wait, but wait, in Mutant3's DNA, is there an in-frame stop codon earlier?

Looking again:

Mutant3's DNA sequence after ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC is TTCTGTG GAT...

Wait, that's TT C T G T G G AT...

Wait, maybe the codons are TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly)... So, no stop codons.

But wait, in Mutant4, let's see:

Mutant4's DNA sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So after ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC, comes TTCTGTG.

So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC UUC TGT GGA...

Breaking into codons:

AUG (1-3), UUU (4-6), UUA (7-9), CGG (10-12), UAC (13-15), UUC (16-18), TGT (19-21), GGA (22-24), etc.

No stop codons here either.

Wait, then I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me go back to Mutant3 and Mutant4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in Mutant4, the change creates a stop codon.

Looking at Mutant4's DNA sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the codons are:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TTC, TGT, GGA...

Wait, no stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where any of the mutations lead to a frameshift, but earlier I thought that all are substitutions, same length.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are in the first exon and the changes lead to a stop codon.

Wait, going back to the problem statement.

The gene is located in the first exon, so the mutation is in the coding region. So perhaps the correct option is the one where a stop codon is introduced.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a UAA, UAG, or UGA in any of the mutants' sequences before the end.

Looking at Mutant3's mRNA:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Which is AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, after AUG UUU UUA (so Met Phe Phe), then CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc. So no stop codon.

Wait, what about Mutant2?

Mutant2's mRNA is:

ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Which is AUG UUU UUC UAC AGC TGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the codons are: Met, Phe, Leu (from UUC), Tyr (UAC), Ser (AGC), Trp (TGG), Tyr (UAC), etc. No stop codon.

Wait, then perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Wait, let me look at the DNA sequences again. For each mutant, where exactly is the change compared to the wild type.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA

So the change is at position 9 (CTC in wild becomes CTA in Mutant1). So codon 3: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu). So no change in amino acid.

Then codon 4: GCT (Ala) → CGT (Arg). So Ala → Arg. So that's a missense mutation, but no stop.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So codon 3: CTC → CTA (Leu → Leu). Codon4: GCT → AGC (Ala → Ser). So another missense.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Codon3: CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu). Codon4: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg). Codon5: GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp). Codon6: ACT → TCA (Thr → Ser). So several changes, but no stop.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So codon3: CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu). Codon4: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg). Codon5: GGT → TAC (Gly → Tyr). Ah! So in codon5, GGT (Gly) becomes TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Gly to Tyr.

But that's still not a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check each mutant's DNA for any occurrence of a stop codon within the sequence.

Wait, in Mutant4's DNA, after TAC, the next is TTCTGTG. Let's see:

TTCTGTG → split into T T C T G T G. Wait, that's 7 nucleotides, which is not a multiple of three. But that can't be right. Each codon is three nucleotides, so perhaps I made a mistake in the grouping.

Wait, perhaps the exact sequence in Mutant4 is:

After TAC, it's T T C T G T G. So that's 7 nucleotides. Wait, but each codon must be three, so how?

Ah, perhaps I'm grouping wrong. Let me write Mutant4's DNA from the beginning:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC T T C T G T G GAT...

Wait, that would be:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TAC (13-15), T T C (16-18; T T C is Ser), T G T (19-21; Cys), G G A (22-24; Gly), etc.

So the first stop codon in Mutant4 would be the end UGA, same as the wild type.

Wait, but none of the mutants have a stop codon in the middle except for maybe Mutant3 and 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps I should think about which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function. The question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound, implying the gene product is needed for its synthesis. So a mutation that disrupts the gene would stop the compound.

A nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would lead to a truncated protein, likely nonfunctional. A missense mutation might or might not disrupt function, depending on the amino acid change. But which mutant has a stop codon?

Wait, looking again at Mutant3:

Mutant3's DNA has the sequence TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in the mRNA, that's UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, breaking into codons:

AUG (Met), UUU (Phe), UUA (Leu), CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc. So no stop codon yet.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant for a stop codon in the mRNA.

Wild type mRNA ends with UGA.

Mutant1 mRNA: ... TCGC ... → no stop before.

Mutant2: ... TCGC ... → no.

Mutant3: ... CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... → TAC GCT is GCT, etc. No stop.

Mutant4: ... TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... → no stop.

Hmm. Then perhaps the correct answer is a frameshift, but all the mutants are the same length. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations are in the first exon. So the change is in the coding region.

If a substitution occurs in a critical region, it might disrupt the protein. Alternatively, a mutation that disrupts the reading frame (frameshift) would lead to a completely different sequence from the mutation point onward.

But all the mutants are the same length as the wild type, so no frameshift. So all are substitution mutations.

Perhaps the correct answer is a mutation that changes a critical amino acid, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

But without knowing the exact function of the gene, it's hard. However, another possibility is that the mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, leading to a shorter, nonfunctional protein.

Wait, looking again at Mutant3's mRNA:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me write the entire mRNA for Mutant3.

Wild type mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UCG AGA GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... UGA

Mutant3 mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA

Wait, in Mutant3, the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAA ... So the protein would be Met Phe Phe, then stop. So the protein would be very short, much shorter than wild type. That would likely disrupt the gene's function.

So in Mutant3, the gene product would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme that can't produce the anti-nutritional compound.

Similarly, looking at Mutant4: does it have a stop codon?

Mutant4's mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

So the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop codon. So same as Mutant3.

Wait, wait, so both Mutant3 and Mutant4 have UAA in their mRNA sequences, causing premature stops.

Wait, let me confirm.

Mutant3's DNA: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, the third codon is UUA, which is Leu, not a stop. Wait, no, UAA is a stop. So where is UAA?

Ah, perhaps I'm getting the codons wrong. Let me write the DNA of Mutant3:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Each triplet:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), T T C T G T G (22-28), which is 7, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct mRNA for Mutant3 is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

So the codon at 7-9 is UUA (Leu), not a stop. Then where is the stop?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, in Mutant3, the DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... 3'

So the mRNA would be:

5' AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT ... 3'

So the codons are:

AUG (Met), UUU (Phe), UUA (Leu), CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the mRNA for Mutant3 might have a stop codon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in a splicing site, but the question says 'sequence in all mutant lines' refers to the target gene, which I think is the coding region.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation in the middle.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant4's DNA sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Breaking into codons:

AUG, UUU, UUA, CGG, UAC, TTC, TGT, GGA...

So UAC is Tyr, TTC is Phe, TGT is Cys, GGA is Gly. No stop codons.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think of another approach.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the gene is responsible for the compound's synthesis. Destroying the gene would stop the compound.

The best way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function, which can be done by a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, the only way to introduce a stop codon is if one of the mutants has a mutation leading to a stop before the end.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Mutant4. The DNA sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Wait, is there a point where this leads to a UAA, UAG, or UGA codon?

Looking at the codons, I don't see any. So perhaps none of the mutants introduce a stop codon, except perhaps one that I didn't notice.

Wait, maybe I should check the entire mRNA for each mutant.

Mutant1's mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAC CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

No stop before the end.

Mutant2: AUG UUU UUC UAC AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

No stop.

Mutant3: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Ah! Wait, in Mutant3, the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAA ... So the protein would stop after the fourth amino acid.

That would truncate the protein, making it nonfunctional, thus stopping the compound's production.

Similarly, let me check Mutant4's mRNA:

AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop.

So both Mutant3 and Mutant4 have a stop codon at the fourth codon.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are only A to D, and the correct answer is probably one of them.

Wait, let me look at the actual DNA sequences again.

Mutant3 DNA:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the first part is ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC...

Mutant4 DNA:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in Mutant3, after TTA CGC TGG, it's TGT CAC... So the mRNA would have UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His). No stop.

In Mutant4, after TTA CGC TAC, it's TTCTGTG... So the mRNA would have UAC (Tyr), then T T C (Ser), T G T (Cys), G G A (Gly). No stop.

Wait, I'm so confused. Maybe I'm counting wrong.

Perhaps I should look for where the nucleotide changes occur.

In Mutant3, the change is at position 7-9: from CTC (Leu) to TTA (Leu), same amino acid. Then codon 10-12: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg), codon 13-15: GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp), codon 16-18: ACT → TCA (Thr → Ser).

No stop codon introduced.

In Mutant4, the changes are at codon 7-9: CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu), codon 10-12: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg), codon 13-15: GGT → TAC (Gly → Tyr).

No stop codon.

Wait, then perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: the question says the mutation is in the first exon. So perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but the question says they sequenced the target gene, implying they looked at the coding region.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a loss of function by disrupting a crucial region.

But without knowing which amino acids are crucial, it's hard. However, the question is about which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound.

Another possibility is that the mutation alters a critical region, like the active site of an enzyme.

Looking at the wild type and mutant sequences, perhaps the best bet is the mutation that changes several amino acids in a row, possibly disrupting the structure.

But without specific knowledge, perhaps the correct answer is either Mutant1 or Mutant3.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes multiple codons and may disrupt the protein structure, leading to loss of function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a codon to TAC (Tyr), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

Which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? The one that disrupts the gene function. So likely a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a frameshift. Since all are same length, no frameshift.

Wait, earlier I thought Mutant3 and Mutant4 have UAA in their mRNA, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck Mutant4's DNA.

Mutant4's DNA sequence is: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, codon 1: ATG → Met

codon 2: TTT → Phe

codon3: TTA → Leu

codon4: CGC → Arg

codon5: TAC → Tyr

codon6: TTC → Phe

codon7: TGT → Cys

codon8: GGA → Gly

No stop codons.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1. Let me look.

Mutant1's DNA: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So codon3: CTC → CTA (Leu → Leu)

codon4: GCT → CGT (Ala → Arg)

codon5: GGT → GGT (Gly)

codon6: ACT → ACT (Thr)

codon7: TCT → TCT (Ser)

codon8: GTG → GTG (Val)

No stop.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the presence of a start codon and the reading frame.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after the mutation is such that a stop codon occurs earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the point where the mutation occurs.

In the wild type, the first few codons are Met Phe Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr Ser Val...

In Mutant3, the third codon is Leu, fourth is Arg, fifth is Trp, etc.

In Mutant4, the third codon is Leu, fourth is Arg, fifth is Tyr.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a Gly to Tyr, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2 because it changes Ala to Ser, which is a less drastic change than some others.

Wait, but the question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound. So perhaps the best bet is a mutation that introduces a stop codon.

But earlier analysis didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me look again.

Wait, in Mutant3's DNA, the third codon is TTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TGT (Cys), seventh is CAC (His), eighth is T T C (Ser), ninth is TGT (Cys), tenth is GGA (Gly), etc.

No stop codon.

In Mutant4's DNA, codon five is TAC (Tyr), then TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc. No stop.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes Ala to Arg, which could disrupt the active site.

But without knowing which is which, it's hard.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon. Based on earlier error, perhaps none of the options introduce a stop, but the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes codon 4 to CGC (Arg) and codon5 to TGG (Trp), which might be critical.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes codon5 to TAC (Tyr), which could disrupt a critical region.

Wait, but without a stop codon, the protein might still be functional.

Another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the enzyme encoded by this gene. If the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound isn't made. So any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would work.

Perhaps the best bet is the mutation that changes multiple amino acids in a critical region, like the active site.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ...CGC TGG TGT CAC...

So, in Mutant3, the codon changes from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp), ACT (Thr) to TCA (Ser).

This changes a stretch from Ala Gly Thr to Arg Trp Ser. That could disrupt the structure.

In Mutant4: GCT → CGC (Ala→Arg), GGT → TAC (Gly→Tyr).

So changes from Ala Gly to Arg Tyr.

Perhaps this disrupts the structure more.

But without knowing which is more critical, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes more amino acids.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant2: changes Ala to Ser.

B) Mutant3: changes multiple amino acids, including introducing Trp and His.

C) Mutant1: changes Ala to Arg.

D) Mutant4: changes Gly to Tyr, and others.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So any mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

The most likely ways are introducing a stop codon or a frameshift. Since frameshift isn't present, a stop codon is the best option.

But earlier analysis didn't find any stop codons in the mutants except possibly Mutant3 and Mutant4, which I might have misread.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the mRNA of Mutant3.

Wild type mRNA: ... CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant3 mRNA: ... TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC ...

So, the mRNA for Mutant3 would be:

... UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC ...

Which would be:

UUA (Leu), CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His).

No stop codon here.

Wait, then perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a Gly to Tyr, which might be in a key position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target gene's first exon has a critical region, and the mutation in Mutant3 changes a codon to CGC (Arg), which could disrupt a crucial part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it has more changes, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess. I think the correct answer is Mutant3, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the given sequences. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Ends with `TGA`, a stop codon.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `CTA` (Leu)  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `CGT` (Arg)  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  
   - Amino acid changes occur, but the protein may still be functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `AGC` (Ser)  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  
   - A single amino acid change is less likely to completely disrupt the protein.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TTA` (Leu)  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `TGG` (Trp)  
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `TCA` (Ser)  
   - **Critical observation**: The sequence does **not** introduce a premature stop codon. However, multiple amino acid changes occur, significantly altering the protein structure and likely rendering it nonfunctional.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TTA` (Leu)  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  
   - While there are amino acid changes, they are less extensive compared to Mutant 3.

### Conclusion:
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 3**. While it does not introduce a premature stop codon, the multiple amino acid changes significantly disrupt the protein structure, making it nonfunctional and preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound, and they've found the responsible gene which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the gene sequences.

The intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants are shown. The task is to find which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I'm assuming the gene is responsible for producing the compound, so a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would probably stop the compound from being made. So I'm looking for a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or disrupts the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants have changes in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant's sequence with the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'. Let me note the exact changes in each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing this to the wild type:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...
Mut1: ATG TTT CTA CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, wait, let me write the first part again. Maybe I should look at each position. Let's see, the wild type has a certain number of bases, and all the mutations are in the first exon area.

Looking at each position where the change occurs:

For Mutant 1, perhaps the sixth codon is different. Let me index the wild type:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
... and so on.

Mutant 1's sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Let me compare:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mut1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, maybe I got the reading wrong. Let me count.

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT
Mut1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT

Wait, so in wild type, the third codon is CTC (Leu). In Mutant 1, it's CTA (Leu again?), but wait, perhaps I'm looking at different positions.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the differences are. Let me look for the exact spot where the nucleotides change.

In the wild type, the sequence starts as ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So in the wild type, after the initial ATG, positions 4-6 are TTT (phenylalanine?), 7-9 CTC (leu), 10-12 GCT (Ala), etc.

In Mutant 1, positions 7-9 are CT A. Wait, no, perhaps I should compare each part step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the mutations occur in the DNA sequence.

The wild type is 5' ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA 3'

Mutant1: 5' ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA 3'

Compare the two:

Looking for where the letters differ. Let's write them out:

Wild: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T ... T G A

Mut1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ... T G A

So looking at each position:

Position 7: Wild has C, Mut1 has C? No, wait position 7 is the 7th nucleotide. Let me count:

The first part is the first 10 nucleotides for Wild:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G

Mutant1:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: A
10: C

Ah, so at position 9, Wild has C, Mutant1 has A.

So positions 7-9 in Wild: C T C (Leu), in Mutant1: C T A (Leu as well, since CT A is Leu too? Wait, CT A is actually CT A, which is codon CT A? Wait, no, position 7-9 in Wild is C T C (Leu), and in Mutant1, positions 7-9 are C T A (Leu again, because CT A is the same as CTA, which is Leu. Hmm, so that's a silent mutation perhaps.

Wait wait, but wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me write the first 20 nucleotides.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...
Mut1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in the third codon or a later one.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is a substitution that changes an amino acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which mutations cause a frameshift or a stop codon.

A frameshift would occur if the number of nucleotides is changed by insertions or deletions not in multiples of three, leading to a shift in the reading frame. But all the mutants have the same length as the wild type, so no insertions or deletions. Therefore, all mutations are substitutions.

So the question is which substitution would cause a premature stop codon or disrupt the protein structure.

Let me look at each mutant:

Wild Type: ... TGA ... (TGA is a stop codon, but that's at the end.)

Mutant 1: ... TGA, same as wild, but the sequence before might have a change.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 1: After ATG, the next codons are TTT, then CT A (so codon becomes CTA, which is Leu again). Then CGT (Arg), then GGT (Gly), etc. So perhaps it's a silent mutation or maybe not. But I don't see a stop codon here.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, let me compare the sequences. Let me write the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mut2: ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in the wild, position 7-9: CTC (Leu), position 10-12: GCT (Ala), 13-15: GGT (Gly), 16-18: ACT (Thr), 19-21: TCT (Ser), etc.

In Mutant2, perhaps the 10-12 is AGC. Let's see:

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ... CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mut2: ... CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

Wait, perhaps my approach is confusing. Let me compare the sequences character by character.

Wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant2 starts with ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, let's look for the differences.

The first 10 nucleotides of wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AGC

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me write the first 30 letters.

Wild: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T ... T G A

Mutant2: A T G T T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ... T G A

So in Wild, positions 7-9 are C T C (Leu), position 10-12 G C T (Ala), 13-15 G G T (Gly), 16-18 A C T (Thr), etc.

In Mutant2, after the start and TTT, at position 7: C, 8: T, 9: A. So codon 3 (positions 7-9) is CTA (Leu).

Then position 10-12: A G C (Ser instead of Ala). So that's a substitution from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So that's an amino acid change from Ala to Ser. Not a stop codon yet.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 
Mut3: ATG TTT TT A CG C TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

So let me look for the differences.

Wild's first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut3's: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in the wild, positions 4-6 are TTT (Phe), positions 7-9 CTC (Leu), 10-12 GCT(Ala), 13-15 GGT (Gly), 16-18 ACT (Thr), 19-21 TCT (Ser), 22-24 GTG (Val), etc.

In Mut3:

Positions 4-6: TTT (same as wild)
Positions 7-9: TTA (Leu)
Position 10-12: CGC (Arg)
Positions 13-15: TGG (Trp)
Positions 16-18: TCA (Ser)
Etc.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations are. Let me compare each position.

At the beginning:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mut3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC...

So in Wild, after ATG TTT, comes CTC. Mut3 has TTA instead. So starting from position 7, Wild is CTC (Leu), Mut3 is TTA (Leu). So that's same amino acid.

Then, Wild's next codon is GCT (Ala), in Mut3, it's CGC (Arg). So that's a change from Ala to Arg. Then Wild's next codon is GGT (Gly), Mut3 has TGG (Trp). So Gly to Trp. Then Wild's next codon is ACT (Thr), Mut3 has TCA (Ser). So Thr to Ser.

So several amino acid changes, but no stop codon.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mut4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So Wild's first part:

...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4's:

...CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in Mut4:

After ATG TTT, comes TTA (Leu). Then CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), then TTCTGTG.

Looking at the wild, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mut4, let's see the changes:

At position 7: Wild is CTC (Leu), Mut4 is TTA (Leu). So same amino acid.

Position 10-12: Wild is GCT (Ala), Mut4 is CGC (Arg). So change from Ala to Arg.

Position 13-15: Wild is GGT (Gly), Mut4 is TAC (Tyr).

Hmm. So in the middle of the sequence, the codons change.

Wait, wait, looking at Mut4's sequence, in the middle, after TAC, the next is TTCTGTG.

Let me write the entire first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in Mut4, after TAC, comes T T C T G T G.

Wait, so the sequence after TAC is TTCTGTG. Let's see:

TAC is position 13-15. Then, next codon would be TT C (but that's not possible because it's T T C T G T G. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of nucleotides.

Looking at the exact sequence:

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4: ...CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the sequence of Mut4 is:

After ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC, then comes TTCTGTG.

So, the sequence is TTCTGTG. Let's break this into codons:

TT C T G T G ?

Wait, perhaps the actual sequence is T T C T G T G.

Breaking into triplets:

TT C (that can't be right because that's a 3-mer: T T C is Ser. Then T G T is Cys, then G is leftover but that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe I'm not breaking it correctly. Let's think about the exact letters.

Looking at Mut4's sequence: ...TAC TTCTGTG...

The TAC is the 13-15 positions, then the next part is TTCTGTG.

So that's T T C T G T G.

In triplets, that's T T C | T G T | G... but the G at the end would be part of the next codon. Wait, but that's 7 nucleotides after TAC, so that's not a multiple of 3. Wait, no, perhaps the sequence is longer.

Wait, perhaps the entire sequence is:

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mut4: ...CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, in Mut4, the portion from position 13 onward is CGC TAC T T C T G T G GAT...

So, let's see, the codons are:

CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly)... Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether any of the mutations introduce a stop codon.

A stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. Let's see if any of the mutations introduce that.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild type ends with ...TGA (which is a stop codon, as in the last part TGA).

In Mutant1: ...TGA as well, but not sure about the middle.

Mutant2: ...TGA.

Mutant3: ...TGA.

Mutant4: ...TGA.

Wait, but maybe the mutations are in the middle, causing a stop earlier.

Wait, let me check each mutant for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ... TAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

So, the part TTCTGTG is T T C T G T G.

Wait, the triplet TAC would be positions 13-15: TAC (Tyr). Then positions 16-18: T T C (Ser). 19-21: T G T (Cys). 22-24: G G A (Gly). Hmm, no stop codons here.

Looking at Mutant3's sequence: ... TAC GCT GGT GT CAC...

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Mut4's DNA sequence (after the start) is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC UUC UGT GGA... (since DNA is 5' to 3', mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand, but for the coding strand, it's same as DNA but T→U.)

Wait, maybe I should think in mRNA terms. Let me get the mRNA for each mutant and check for stop codons.

Wild type mRNA starts with AUG UUU UUC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... UGA.

So the wild type has a stop codon at the end (UGA).

Mutant1's mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... UGA.

So, in Mutant1, any stop codons before the end? Let's see:

Looking at the mRNA sequence of Mutant1: AUG UUU UUC UAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... UGA.

Looking for UAA, UAG, UGA. The last codon is UGA (stop). Any others? Before that, the sequence seems normal. So no premature stop.

Mutant2's mRNA:

AUG UUU UUC UAC AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

Again, checking for any UAA, UAG, UGA:

No, the only stop is at the end.

Mutant3's mRNA:

AUG UUU UUC UAA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

Wait, looking at Mutant3's mRNA: the first few codons are AUG UUU UUC UAA ... So after the initial Met Phe Phe, the next codon is UAA, which is a stop codon. Oh! So in Mutant3, there's a UAA at positions 10-12 of the mRNA (which correspond to the DNA positions where the mutation occurred).

So that would cause a premature stop codon. If the gene is disrupted early, the protein would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme that can't produce the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant4's mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

Wait, same as Mutant3? Or did I get it wrong.

Wait, the DNA for Mutant4 is: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UAC TTTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

So, the codon after UUU UUC is UAA. So again, same as Mutant3, having a stop codon early.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. Let me break down the DNA sequences into codons.

Wild type: 5’ ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT ... TGA 3’.

So each group of three is a codon.

Mutant3: 5’ ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... TGA 3’.

So the codons are:

ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC( Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTCTGTG (wait, that's 7 nucleotides, which can't be right. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait: the entire sequence is ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

Wait, maybe the TTCTGTG is actually split into T T C TGT G (but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps it's a longer sequence. Let me recount.

In Mutant3:

The DNA after TTA CGC is TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, the codons would be:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), T T C T G T G (22-28? That can't be right. Wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire sequence in triplets.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ...

So, the first few codons are:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), TT C T G T G (22-28? That doesn't make sense). Wait, perhaps the TTCTGTG is part of the same codon? Maybe I'm not breaking it down correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any in-frame stop codons in the mRNA.

Mutant3's DNA sequence: ...TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA would be:

...TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT... → but mRNA is complementary and in the same direction, but T becomes U. So the mRNA would have ...TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT... → which becomes ...UUU GGC AC CAC CTTCTGTG GAT... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the DNA sequence of Mutant3 is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, let's break that into codons:

AUG (1-3), UUU (4-6), UUA (7-9), CGG (10-12), UGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), CUU (22-24), CTG (25-27), TGG (28-30), AT... (but AT is just two letters, so perhaps I'm missing something).

Wait, but looking at codon 7-9 in the mRNA: UUA (Leu). Then CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc. No stop codons yet.

Wait, but wait, in Mutant3's DNA, is there an in-frame stop codon earlier?

Looking again:

Mutant3's DNA sequence after ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC is TTCTGTG GAT...

Wait, that's TT C T G T G G AT...

Wait, maybe the codons are TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly)... So, no stop codons.

But wait, in Mutant4, let's see:

Mutant4's DNA sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So after ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC, comes TTCTGTG.

So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC UUC TGT GGA...

Breaking into codons:

AUG (1-3), UUU (4-6), UUA (7-9), CGG (10-12), UAC (13-15), UUC (16-18), TGT (19-21), GGA (22-24), etc.

No stop codons here either.

Wait, then I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me go back to Mutant3 and Mutant4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in Mutant4, the change creates a stop codon.

Looking at Mutant4's DNA sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the codons are:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TTC, TGT, GGA...

Wait, no stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where any of the mutations lead to a frameshift, but earlier I thought that all are substitutions, same length.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are in the first exon and the changes lead to a stop codon.

Wait, going back to the problem statement.

The gene is located in the first exon, so the mutation is in the coding region. So perhaps the correct option is the one where a stop codon is introduced.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a UAA, UAG, or UGA in any of the mutants' sequences before the end.

Looking at Mutant3's mRNA:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Which is AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, after AUG UUU UUA (so Met Phe Phe), then CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc. So no stop codon.

Wait, what about Mutant2?

Mutant2's mRNA is:

ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Which is AUG UUU UUC UAC AGC TGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the codons are: Met, Phe, Leu (from UUC), Tyr (UAC), Ser (AGC), Trp (TGG), Tyr (UAC), etc. No stop codon.

Wait, then perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Wait, let me look at the DNA sequences again. For each mutant, where exactly is the change compared to the wild type.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA

So the change is at position 9 (CTC in wild becomes CTA in Mutant1). So codon 3: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu). So no change in amino acid.

Then codon 4: GCT (Ala) → CGT (Arg). So Ala → Arg. So that's a missense mutation, but no stop.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AG C TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So codon 3: CTC → CTA (Leu → Leu). Codon4: GCT → AGC (Ala → Ser). So another missense.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Codon3: CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu). Codon4: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg). Codon5: GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp). Codon6: ACT → TCA (Thr → Ser). So several changes, but no stop.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So codon3: CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu). Codon4: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg). Codon5: GGT → TAC (Gly → Tyr). Ah! So in codon5, GGT (Gly) becomes TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Gly to Tyr.

But that's still not a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check each mutant's DNA for any occurrence of a stop codon within the sequence.

Wait, in Mutant4's DNA, after TAC, the next is TTCTGTG. Let's see:

TTCTGTG → split into T T C T G T G. Wait, that's 7 nucleotides, which is not a multiple of three. But that can't be right. Each codon is three nucleotides, so perhaps I made a mistake in the grouping.

Wait, perhaps the exact sequence in Mutant4 is:

After TAC, it's T T C T G T G. So that's 7 nucleotides. Wait, but each codon must be three, so how?

Ah, perhaps I'm grouping wrong. Let me write Mutant4's DNA from the beginning:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC T T C T G T G GAT...

Wait, that would be:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TAC (13-15), T T C (16-18; T T C is Ser), T G T (19-21; Cys), G G A (22-24; Gly), etc.

So the first stop codon in Mutant4 would be the end UGA, same as the wild type.

Wait, but none of the mutants have a stop codon in the middle except for maybe Mutant3 and 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps I should think about which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function. The question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound, implying the gene product is needed for its synthesis. So a mutation that disrupts the gene would stop the compound.

A nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would lead to a truncated protein, likely nonfunctional. A missense mutation might or might not disrupt function, depending on the amino acid change. But which mutant has a stop codon?

Wait, looking again at Mutant3:

Mutant3's DNA has the sequence TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in the mRNA, that's UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, breaking into codons:

AUG (Met), UUU (Phe), UUA (Leu), CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc. So no stop codon yet.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant for a stop codon in the mRNA.

Wild type mRNA ends with UGA.

Mutant1 mRNA: ... TCGC ... → no stop before.

Mutant2: ... TCGC ... → no.

Mutant3: ... CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... → TAC GCT is GCT, etc. No stop.

Mutant4: ... TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... → no stop.

Hmm. Then perhaps the correct answer is a frameshift, but all the mutants are the same length. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations are in the first exon. So the change is in the coding region.

If a substitution occurs in a critical region, it might disrupt the protein. Alternatively, a mutation that disrupts the reading frame (frameshift) would lead to a completely different sequence from the mutation point onward.

But all the mutants are the same length as the wild type, so no frameshift. So all are substitution mutations.

Perhaps the correct answer is a mutation that changes a critical amino acid, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

But without knowing the exact function of the gene, it's hard. However, another possibility is that the mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, leading to a shorter, nonfunctional protein.

Wait, looking again at Mutant3's mRNA:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me write the entire mRNA for Mutant3.

Wild type mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UCG AGA GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... UGA

Mutant3 mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA

Wait, in Mutant3, the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAA ... So the protein would be Met Phe Phe, then stop. So the protein would be very short, much shorter than wild type. That would likely disrupt the gene's function.

So in Mutant3, the gene product would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme that can't produce the anti-nutritional compound.

Similarly, looking at Mutant4: does it have a stop codon?

Mutant4's mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT ... UGA.

So the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop codon. So same as Mutant3.

Wait, wait, so both Mutant3 and Mutant4 have UAA in their mRNA sequences, causing premature stops.

Wait, let me confirm.

Mutant3's DNA: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

Wait, the third codon is UUA, which is Leu, not a stop. Wait, no, UAA is a stop. So where is UAA?

Ah, perhaps I'm getting the codons wrong. Let me write the DNA of Mutant3:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Each triplet:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), TGG (13-15), TGT (16-18), CAC (19-21), T T C T G T G (22-28), which is 7, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct mRNA for Mutant3 is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT...

So the codon at 7-9 is UUA (Leu), not a stop. Then where is the stop?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, in Mutant3, the DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT ... 3'

So the mRNA would be:

5' AUG UUU UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC CUU CTG TGG AT ... 3'

So the codons are:

AUG (Met), UUU (Phe), UUA (Leu), CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), CUU (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the mRNA for Mutant3 might have a stop codon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in a splicing site, but the question says 'sequence in all mutant lines' refers to the target gene, which I think is the coding region.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation in the middle.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant4's DNA sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Breaking into codons:

AUG, UUU, UUA, CGG, UAC, TTC, TGT, GGA...

So UAC is Tyr, TTC is Phe, TGT is Cys, GGA is Gly. No stop codons.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think of another approach.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the gene is responsible for the compound's synthesis. Destroying the gene would stop the compound.

The best way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function, which can be done by a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, the only way to introduce a stop codon is if one of the mutants has a mutation leading to a stop before the end.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Mutant4. The DNA sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UUU UUA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Wait, is there a point where this leads to a UAA, UAG, or UGA codon?

Looking at the codons, I don't see any. So perhaps none of the mutants introduce a stop codon, except perhaps one that I didn't notice.

Wait, maybe I should check the entire mRNA for each mutant.

Mutant1's mRNA: AUG UUU UUC UAC CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

No stop before the end.

Mutant2: AUG UUU UUC UAC AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

No stop.

Mutant3: AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

Ah! Wait, in Mutant3, the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would be AUG UUU UUC UAA ... So the protein would stop after the fourth amino acid.

That would truncate the protein, making it nonfunctional, thus stopping the compound's production.

Similarly, let me check Mutant4's mRNA:

AUG UUU UUC UAA CGG UAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the fourth codon is UAA, which is a stop.

So both Mutant3 and Mutant4 have a stop codon at the fourth codon.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are only A to D, and the correct answer is probably one of them.

Wait, let me look at the actual DNA sequences again.

Mutant3 DNA:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So the first part is ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC...

Mutant4 DNA:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So in Mutant3, after TTA CGC TGG, it's TGT CAC... So the mRNA would have UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His). No stop.

In Mutant4, after TTA CGC TAC, it's TTCTGTG... So the mRNA would have UAC (Tyr), then T T C (Ser), T G T (Cys), G G A (Gly). No stop.

Wait, I'm so confused. Maybe I'm counting wrong.

Perhaps I should look for where the nucleotide changes occur.

In Mutant3, the change is at position 7-9: from CTC (Leu) to TTA (Leu), same amino acid. Then codon 10-12: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg), codon 13-15: GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp), codon 16-18: ACT → TCA (Thr → Ser).

No stop codon introduced.

In Mutant4, the changes are at codon 7-9: CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu), codon 10-12: GCT → CGC (Ala → Arg), codon 13-15: GGT → TAC (Gly → Tyr).

No stop codon.

Wait, then perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: the question says the mutation is in the first exon. So perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but the question says they sequenced the target gene, implying they looked at the coding region.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a loss of function by disrupting a crucial region.

But without knowing which amino acids are crucial, it's hard. However, the question is about which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound.

Another possibility is that the mutation alters a critical region, like the active site of an enzyme.

Looking at the wild type and mutant sequences, perhaps the best bet is the mutation that changes several amino acids in a row, possibly disrupting the structure.

But without specific knowledge, perhaps the correct answer is either Mutant1 or Mutant3.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes multiple codons and may disrupt the protein structure, leading to loss of function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a codon to TAC (Tyr), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

Which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? The one that disrupts the gene function. So likely a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a frameshift. Since all are same length, no frameshift.

Wait, earlier I thought Mutant3 and Mutant4 have UAA in their mRNA, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck Mutant4's DNA.

Mutant4's DNA sequence is: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTGTG GAT...

So, codon 1: ATG → Met

codon 2: TTT → Phe

codon3: TTA → Leu

codon4: CGC → Arg

codon5: TAC → Tyr

codon6: TTC → Phe

codon7: TGT → Cys

codon8: GGA → Gly

No stop codons.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1. Let me look.

Mutant1's DNA: ATG TTT CT A CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So codon3: CTC → CTA (Leu → Leu)

codon4: GCT → CGT (Ala → Arg)

codon5: GGT → GGT (Gly)

codon6: ACT → ACT (Thr)

codon7: TCT → TCT (Ser)

codon8: GTG → GTG (Val)

No stop.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the presence of a start codon and the reading frame.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after the mutation is such that a stop codon occurs earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the point where the mutation occurs.

In the wild type, the first few codons are Met Phe Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr Ser Val...

In Mutant3, the third codon is Leu, fourth is Arg, fifth is Trp, etc.

In Mutant4, the third codon is Leu, fourth is Arg, fifth is Tyr.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a Gly to Tyr, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2 because it changes Ala to Ser, which is a less drastic change than some others.

Wait, but the question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound. So perhaps the best bet is a mutation that introduces a stop codon.

But earlier analysis didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me look again.

Wait, in Mutant3's DNA, the third codon is TTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TGT (Cys), seventh is CAC (His), eighth is T T C (Ser), ninth is TGT (Cys), tenth is GGA (Gly), etc.

No stop codon.

In Mutant4's DNA, codon five is TAC (Tyr), then TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc. No stop.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes Ala to Arg, which could disrupt the active site.

But without knowing which is which, it's hard.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon. Based on earlier error, perhaps none of the options introduce a stop, but the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes codon 4 to CGC (Arg) and codon5 to TGG (Trp), which might be critical.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes codon5 to TAC (Tyr), which could disrupt a critical region.

Wait, but without a stop codon, the protein might still be functional.

Another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the enzyme encoded by this gene. If the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound isn't made. So any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would work.

Perhaps the best bet is the mutation that changes multiple amino acids in a critical region, like the active site.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ...CGC TGG TGT CAC...

So, in Mutant3, the codon changes from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp), ACT (Thr) to TCA (Ser).

This changes a stretch from Ala Gly Thr to Arg Trp Ser. That could disrupt the structure.

In Mutant4: GCT → CGC (Ala→Arg), GGT → TAC (Gly→Tyr).

So changes from Ala Gly to Arg Tyr.

Perhaps this disrupts the structure more.

But without knowing which is more critical, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes more amino acids.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant2: changes Ala to Ser.

B) Mutant3: changes multiple amino acids, including introducing Trp and His.

C) Mutant1: changes Ala to Arg.

D) Mutant4: changes Gly to Tyr, and others.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So any mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

The most likely ways are introducing a stop codon or a frameshift. Since frameshift isn't present, a stop codon is the best option.

But earlier analysis didn't find any stop codons in the mutants except possibly Mutant3 and Mutant4, which I might have misread.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the mRNA of Mutant3.

Wild type mRNA: ... CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant3 mRNA: ... TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC ...

So, the mRNA for Mutant3 would be:

... UUA CGG UGG TGT CAC ...

Which would be:

UUA (Leu), CGG (Arg), UGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His).

No stop codon here.

Wait, then perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a Gly to Tyr, which might be in a key position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target gene's first exon has a critical region, and the mutation in Mutant3 changes a codon to CGC (Arg), which could disrupt a crucial part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it has more changes, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess. I think the correct answer is Mutant3, option B.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the given sequences. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Ends with `TGA`, a stop codon.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `CTA` (Leu)  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `CGT` (Arg)  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  
   - Amino acid changes occur, but the protein may still be functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `AGC` (Ser)  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  
   - A single amino acid change is less likely to completely disrupt the protein.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TTA` (Leu)  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `TGG` (Trp)  
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `TCA` (Ser)  
   - **Critical observation**: The sequence does **not** introduce a premature stop codon. However, multiple amino acid changes occur, significantly altering the protein structure and likely rendering it nonfunctional.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Codon changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TTA` (Leu)  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
   - No premature stop codon introduced.  
   - While there are amino acid changes, they are less extensive compared to Mutant 3.

### Conclusion:
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 3**. While it does not introduce a premature stop codon, the multiple amino acid changes significantly disrupt the protein structure, making it nonfunctional and preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: B**
