Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about the redshift of objects detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, if the cloud is absorbing this light, that means the quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms is being absorbed. So when we observe this absorption line, its wavelength will be stretched due to the expansion of the universe, right? That's the redshift effect.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. But optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. I think that the optical range is roughly from about 400 to 700 nanometers, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Because 1 nanometer is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait. For ground-based optical telescopes, the observed wavelength needs to be longer than the Lyman limit (which is about 912 Angstroms) but in the visible range. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be in the range that the telescope can see.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z).

But since the quasar's light is absorbed by hydrogen, the absorption line is at lambda_obs. So, we need lambda_obs to be in the optical range.

The lower limit on redshift would correspond to when lambda_obs is just reaching into the optical range. Let's say the threshold is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), but wait, 1216 Angstroms * (1+z) = lambda_obs. We want lambda_obs to be as small as possible but still in the optical range. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So if the quasar emits at 1216 Angstroms, and the hydrogen cloud is at redshift z, the absorption would be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. But we need this to be observed in the optical, so 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) and above.

Wait, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is blue. So to find the minimum z where 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, because higher z gives longer observed wavelength. So if we set 1216*(1+z) = 4000, then solve for z.

Let me compute that: (1+z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29. But looking at the options, I see option C is 2.4, option D is 1.9. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Because sometimes, the Lyman alpha line is emitted by the quasar, and distant hydrogen clouds can absorb it. The quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms (which is in the UV) is absorbed by intervening hydrogen. So when we observe this absorption line, the wavelength would be redshifted. But if the redshift is too high, the observed wavelength would be in the infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see. So the minimum redshift is when the absorption line is just entering the optical range.

Wait, but optical is up to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So the maximum wavelength we can observe is 7000 Angstroms. So to have the absorption line in the optical, the observed wavelength must be <=7000 Angstroms.

Wait, no. Wait, we want the absorption line to be in the part of the spectrum that can be observed. So for optical, the observed wavelength should be less than about 7000 Angstroms.

So we have 1216*(1+z) <= 7000. Let me compute (1+z) = 7000/1216 ≈5.756. So z≈4.756. But that's higher than any of the options given. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So perhaps the object's redshift must be such that the absorption line is in the observed frame within the optical range. So the lower limit is when the absorption line is just at the start of the optical range.

Wait, but the optical range is from about 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). So the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Angstroms, when redshifted, must be in that range.

So the minimum redshift would be when the absorption line is just within the optical, i.e., when lambda_obs = 4000 Angstroms.

So z is (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.29) -1 = 2.29. So approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. So the lower limit would be around 2.3, so the minimum redshift is z≈2.3. So the answer would be option C) 2.4.

But wait, some sources say that optical telescopes can't go below about 360 nm (3600 Angstroms). Let me check. Wait, maybe the actual cutoff is higher, say 360 nm (3600 Angstroms). If that's the case, then lambda_obs must be >= 3600 Angstroms.

Wait, no, because the atmosphere is opaque to UV below about 310 nm (3100 Angstroms). So any light below that is absorbed and doesn't reach the ground-based telescopes. So to be observed, the wavelength must be above 3100 Angstroms?

Wait, no, wait. The atmosphere doesn't transmit wavelengths below about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), which is in the UV. So for a ground-based telescope to observe the absorption line, lambda_obs must be longer than 3000 Angstroms. Because anything below that doesn't reach us.

So, the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. So if the cloud has a redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) >= 3000 Angstroms.

So (1+z) >= 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.466. So z ≈ 1.466.

Hmm, but that's lower than some of the options. Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers here. Let me double-check the cutoff. The atmospheric transmission window for optical is from about 3000 Angstroms (300 nm, UV) up to about 10000 Angstroms (1000 nm, infrared). So ground-based telescopes can observe wavelengths from about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) up to about 2500 nm (25000 Angstroms), but beyond that, the atmosphere doesn't let the light through. Wait, no, actually, the optical window is considered to be 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

So, I think the key point is that the Lyman-alpha absorption must be in the optical range that ground-based telescopes can observe. The Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm, which is in FUV). So when it's redshifted, the observed wavelength is longer.

If the observed wavelength is in the optical (say, 4000 to 7000 Angstroms), then z would be (lambda_obs / 1216) -1.

But for the lower limit, we need the smallest z such that the Lyman-alpha line is just within the optical. So when lambda_obs is 4000 Angstroms (the start of optical), z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So about 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 2.4.

Alternatively, some might argue that the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is at the start of the UV that the telescope can see, but I think the question is about optical. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the Lyman limit or other factors.

Wait, another thought: quasars emit light across a broad spectrum. The Lyman-alpha emission line is in the UV (1216 Angstroms). If a cloud with redshift z is in front of the quasar, it will absorb the quasar's light at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. For ground-based telescopes to observe this absorption line, it has to be in the range that's not absorbed by the atmosphere. So the absorption line must be in the optical window, which is roughly 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) and above.

Wait, but 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms. So let me compute z for 3000 Angstroms.

z = (3000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.466 -1 = 1.466. So z≈1.47.

So the lower limit would be z ≈1.47. But the options don't have that. The closest options are B)1.2 and D)1.9.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Because the Lyman-alpha absorption is actually observed in the rest frame of the cloud. Wait no, the cloud is at redshift z. So the quasar's emitted Lyman-alpha is at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud, being at redshift z, would absorb that light, and the absorption line would be observed at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar.

So the quasar's redshift is larger than z_cloud. But when considering the absorption line, it's at 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, 4000 <= 1216*(1+z_cloud) <= 7000.

So 4000/1216 ≈3.29 <= (1+z_cloud) <=7000/1216≈5.756.

So z_cloud must be >=2.29 and <=4.756.

So the minimum redshift for the cloud is z=2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.3. Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is the closest.

But wait, another angle: if the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, and the cloud is in front, but the problem is just about the cloud's redshift. The question says "such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes".

So, the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman-alpha absorption line (1216*(1+z)) is in the optical. So, for the telescope to see it, 1216*(1+z) must be >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, 4000 is 400 nm, which is the start of the visible spectrum. So 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

So (1+z) >=4000/1216 ≈3.29, so z >=2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.3.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.4.

Wait, but why isn't the answer 3? Because 4000 Angstroms is the start of the visible. So any object with z >=2.3 would have the Lyman-alpha line in the optical.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the quasar's light is also redshifted. Hmm, but the question is about the clouds, not the quasars.

Wait, the clouds are neutral hydrogen in deep space. They're at a certain redshift, and they absorb the quasar's light. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud.

But the question is about the redshift of the cloud. So the cloud's redshift must be such that its Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical.

So, the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is when the absorption line is at 4000 Angstroms.

So z_cloud ≈2.29, which would be approximately 2.3. The options given are 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). So 2.4 is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with more precise numbers. Let me compute 4000 divided by 1216.

1216 * 3 = 3648
4000 -3648= 352. So 3.29 is 3 + 352/1216 ≈3.290.

So z=2.290. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. The options don't have that exact number, but option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but why not option D? Because option D is 1.9, which would give a wavelength of 1216*(1+1.9)= 1216*2.9≈3526 Angstroms, which is about 352.6 nm (UV). But ground-based telescopes can't observe that because of atmospheric absorption. So the absorption line would be in the UV, which doesn't reach us.

Thus, the minimum redshift is when the absorption line is at 4000 Angstroms, which is option C) 2.4.

Wait, but wait. 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 1216 * 3.4 = let's calculate that.

1216 *3=3648, 1216*0.4=486.4. So 3648+486.4=4134.4 Angstroms, which is 413.4 nm, which is violet light. So that's within the visible range.

If z is 2.4, then the absorption is at about 4134 Angstroms, which is visible.

So the correct lower limit is approximately 2.3, so option C (2.4) is the best fit.

To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we start by considering the properties of the Lyman-alpha wavelength and the optical range of these telescopes.

The Lyman-alpha absorption line has a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). For the absorption line to be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, its observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must lie within the optical range, which is approximately \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (400 nm) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \) (700 nm). The relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift \( z \) is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we consider the smallest wavelength in the optical range, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
4000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]
\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C).

To confirm, if \( z = 2.4 \), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 1216 \cdot 3.4 \approx 4134 \, \text{Å}
\]

This corresponds to \( 413.4 \, \text{nm} \), which is within the optical range and detectable by ground-based telescopes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
