Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a transgenic mouse model isn't expressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they're overexpressing the GADD45G gene. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To do this, they're using a construct where the coding sequence of GADD45G is modified. They've introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the protein. This probably means they've added a HA tag at the beginning of the protein so they can purify it via affinity methods.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. So they looked into the DNA sequence of their construct's plus strand and found an issue.

Looking at the options, let's think about what each could mean.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag is altered, potentially making it not recognizable for purification. But the problem is about overexpression, not whether the protein can be purified. Although if the HA tag is mutated, the protein might not be properly expressed or could be misfolded, but the question says the issue is in the plus strand sequence, so perhaps the HA is correct. Not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Ribosomes stop at stop codons. If the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated. Looking at the provided sequence, I can scan for stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). Let me look through the sequence. Hmm, let's see. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then it goes through various codons. Let me see if there's a TAA, TAG, or TGA anywhere.

Looking at the end, I see ...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

I'll scan for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let me go through the sequence letter by letter.

Looking at the end, the last part is ...TGA. Wait, I see TGA towards the very end. Let me see. The last part is GAGTGA. So the last codons are GAG (which is glutamic acid) followed by TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence ends with TGA. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start is ATG, and the stop codon is at the end.

So if the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA, that's a stop codon. But wait, the way the construct is designed matters. If the HA tag is added before the GADD45G coding sequence, then the start codon is still ATG, and the stop should be at the end of the GADD45G coding sequence. However, perhaps the construct was designed to include the HA tag as a fusion, so the end of the HA would be before the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag has its own stop codon, or the GADD45G sequence was not correctly appended. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is disrupting the reading frame, but if they used the correct in-frame tag, that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, another thought: the plasmid was designed to express the HA-tagged GADD45G. So the coding sequence should be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA is followed by a stop codon, that would end translation prematurely, but in this case, the provided sequence doesn't have a stop codon until the very end.

Wait, the construct's coding sequence is provided as the plus strand. Let me count the triplet codons to see if the stop is correctly placed.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mutation in the HA tag. But the problem is about overexpression not happening.

Let me think about the options again. Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the coding sequence before the actual end. Looking at the sequence, the end has TGA. So wait, that's the last codon. The last few nucleotides are ...CTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA. So the protein would stop at that point. But that's the actual end of the coding sequence, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not followed correctly. Let me think about how the HA tag is added. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should start with the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was inserted incorrectly. For example, if the HA tag's coding sequence had a stop codon in the middle, that would cause the ribosome to stop early, truncating the protein. So if the HA tag's coding sequence had a TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame, that would be a problem.

Looking at the plus strand sequence, the beginning is ATG, then TAC (Tyr), then CCAT... Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence would be a short addition. Let me see the initial part of the provided sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... 

Wait, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then TAC (tyrosine), then GAT (aspartic acid), then G... Hmm, the HA tag is a small peptide, so perhaps the HA coding sequence is at the beginning. Let me think, the HA tag is 11 amino acids long. So the coding sequence for HA would be about 33 nucleotides. Let's see.

The HA sequence (antigenic determinant) is added as a sequence. So the plasmid's coding sequence begins with the HA coding sequence, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But in the given sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's the start of the HA tag? Or perhaps not. Let me think about the HA tag's amino acid sequence. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. A common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is shorter. Let me think about the nucleotide sequence.

Wait, the initial codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAA (glutamic acid), etc. So that's the beginning of the HA tag. Wait, but HA tag is a short peptide, perhaps 6 or 11 amino acids. So perhaps the construct's coding sequence for the HA is correct, but if there's a mutation in the HA sequence, that would affect the protein's structure, but not necessarily prevent expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon. For example, if during cloning, the HA tag's sequence was not correctly inserted, perhaps a stop codon was introduced in frame, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

But looking at the given sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G. So no stop codons in the first few. Let me check for any early stop codons in the entire coding sequence.

Looking through the sequence, I need to scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me go through in triplets.

Starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGA GGA GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG GAA GAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAAC GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTTTT GCG AGG AGA GCC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA CCC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, a lot here. Let me look for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Wait, towards the end, I see TGA again. The last part is ...GAGTGA. So that's the last codon. So the entire coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein should be properly terminated there.

But perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not followed by a start codon, but that's unlikely because the HA is at the N-terminus, so the start is at the HA's ATG.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag's coding sequence might have a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. Let me check the beginning. The first few codons are:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GGG (G)
7. TTT (F)
8. CCG (P)
9. GAA (E)
10. GAA (E)
11. GTC (V)
12. CGC (R)
13. GCC (A)
14. CAG (Q)
15. GAC (D)
16. ACA (T)
17. GTT (V)
18. CCG (P)
19. GAA (E)
20. AGC (S)
21. ACG (T)
22. CCA (P)
23. GGA (G)
24. TGC (C)
25. AGG (R)
26. GTG (V)
27. CC (wait, no, I must group in triplets.)

Wait, perhaps I should group the entire sequence into triplets to look for stop codons.

The entire plus strand is 1056 nucleotides long (since each line is about 72 nt, and there are 14 lines, but maybe less precise; but let's count the letters). Each line is approximately 72 nt, so 14 lines would be 1008 nt. But perhaps I should just group the entire sequence into triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in frame with the GADD45G sequence. If the HA tag is correctly added without a stop codon in the middle, the protein should be expressed. But if the HA tag's coding sequence had a stop codon, that would cause the problem.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag might have a frame shift. For example, if the number of nucleotides added for the HA is not a multiple of three, the reading frame would shift, causing the rest of the coding sequence to be incorrect, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and perhaps a premature stop codon.

Looking at the beginning of the provided sequence, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the first few codons are part of the HA sequence. If the HA's coding sequence was not correctly added, perhaps the reading frame is shifted.

Wait, the HA tag is about 11 amino acids. So the nucleotides should be 33 nt. Let's see: the first 33 nt are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG. Wait, that's 11 codons (33 nt). So that's possible.

Wait, let me count the first few nucleotides:

The first line is 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

But it's written in lines, so perhaps I can count the total length. Alternatively, perhaps there's an early stop codon.

Looking at the coding sequence, I can see that the last codon is TGA. So that's correct. So why isn't the protein overexpressed? The options are about possible causes.

Option C says the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker sequence is often added between the HA tag and the target protein to prevent proteolytic cleavage. If the HA tag is right before GADD45G without a linker, proteases might cleave the HA tag, making the recombinant protein unstable. But the question is about overexpression, not about purification. So if the HA is causing the protein to be cleaved, the protein might not accumulate, hence not overexpressed.

Option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. UAA is a stop codon. All stop codons are recognized by release factors, and if the mRNA is in the mouse, the ribosomes should have the machinery to recognize them. So this is unlikely.

So, the options are A, B, C, D.

If the HA tag is correctly added, but the construct has a premature stop codon, that would cause early termination. But looking at the sequence, the only stop codon is at the very end. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, the plasmid might have been designed without a termination codon, but that's not the case here.

Another possibility is that the sequence has a frameshift. Let me count the nucleotides. The entire sequence is 1056 nt (since the last line ends with 3' which is the end). 1056 divided by 3 is 352 codons. So it's a full-length ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift. For example, if the HA was inserted as +1 or +2, then the reading frame would be wrong for the rest of the gene.

Looking at the first few codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA.

Wait, the first codon is ATG (start), and the rest seem to be in frame. So perhaps the HA is correctly added without a frameshift.

Another angle: the HA tag may require a linker peptide to the GADD45G protein. Without a linker, perhaps the two sequences are incompatible, leading to misfolding or degradation. So if the HA is directly fused to GADD45G, the chimeric protein might not fold properly, leading to aggregation or degradation. This could prevent proper expression, making the protein undetectable. So the issue could be that without a linker, the nascent chain is being degraded by proteases (Option C).

Alternatively, the HA tag may have a signal peptide or some other feature that's causing the protein to be secreted instead of being expressed on the cell surface or retained in the cytoplasm. But that might not directly lead to lack of overexpression if the construct is designed to be secreted.

Another possibility is that the construct doesn't have a poly-A tail or Kozak sequence, but that's more relevant for mRNA stability and initiation of translation. The question says that the issue is in the plus strand sequence, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, the problem is that the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the start codon is correct. But perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking again at the initial codons:

ATG (start), TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGG, TTT, CCG, GAA, GAA, GTC, CGC, GCC, CAG, GAC, ACA, GTT, CCG, GAA, AGC, ACG, CCA, GGA, TGC, AGG, GTG, CC... etc.

Looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the first part. I don't see any early stop codons. The first stop is at the very end.

So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another thought: the HA tag might have introduced a cryptic promoter or something else affecting transcription, but the question is about expression, so perhaps it's more about the mRNA being translated.

Wait, the question says the HA is added at the N-terminus, so the start codon is still the first ATG. So the ribosome should start there, translate the HA, then GADD45G, then stop at the end.

If the protein isn't expressed, perhaps the construct is not being properly transcribed. But the antibiotic resistance was selected, so the construct is present. But perhaps the promoter isn't functional or the terminator is causing issues, but the question is about the coding sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon. Let me count the HA's nucleotides. The HA tag is usually about 30 nucleotides (10 codons) for a 10-mer. Let me see: the first 30 nucleotides are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG. So 10 codons. No stop codons here. So perhaps the HA is correctly added.

Wait, the initial HA coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG. So that's 10 codons, no stops.

So the only stop is at the end. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag is followed by a frame shift. Let me check the number of nucleotides in the HA tag. If it's 30 nt (10 codons), then the rest should be in frame. The total length is 1056 nt, which is 352 codons, so it's correct.

Wait, but the HA tag is perhaps longer. Let me think. The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) is 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. So that part is correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: the HA tag may have a stop codon in the middle because of a mutation. For example, if one of the codons became a stop. Looking at the first 30 nt:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG

These are the first 10 codons. No stops here. So no issue.

Wait, but the coding sequence has a long stretch without any stops until the end. So why isn't the protein expressed? Let me think about the options again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if a stop codon was present before the end. But in the given sequence, the only stop is at the end. So Option B is unlikely.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. Without a linker, the HA tag might be recognized as an epitope that's prone to cleavage. For example, if the HA tag is at the N-terminus and the GADD45G is at the C-terminus, perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be recognized by proteases, leading to degradation and preventing accumulation. So the protein is being made but quickly degraded, hence not detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to stall, leading to insufficient translation. But that's less likely.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is not followed by a Kozak sequence or other elements necessary for efficient translation initiation in mammalian cells. But the question focuses on the coding sequence, not the regulatory regions.

Wait, the construct was transfected into CHO cells, which are mammalian. If the Kozak sequence (which is important for initiation) is missing, the translation may be inefficient. The Kozak sequence is typically around the start codon, with a consensus sequence like 'CCACCAUGG'. Looking at the sequence, the start is ATG, preceded by TAC. So the nucleotides before ATG are TAC. Not sure if that's a problem. But the Kozak sequence is more about the context around the start codon, including nucleotides before and after.

If the Kozak sequence is missing, the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low expression. But the question doesn't mention anything about the promoter or regulatory regions; it's about the coding sequence. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Another thought: the HA tag might have introduced a cryptic splice site or something else, but that's more relevant for mRNA processing, which may not be the case here.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question says that the construct is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus, and the coding sequence is provided. The person observed that the protein wasn't overexpressed. They found that the plus strand sequence has a specific issue.

Looking at the options, option C says the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly attached to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the HA is recognized by proteases. For instance, if the HA tag is followed by a protease cleavage site, the HA might be cleaved off, but the rest of the protein might still function. However, if the HA is causing the entire protein to be recognized as a target for proteolysis, the protein won't accumulate.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold, leading to inclusion bodies or degradation. Without a linker, the two domains (HA and GADD45G) might not fold properly, leading to aggregation and preventing detection.

But the question is about the inability to overexpress. If the protein is being made but quickly degraded, the levels would be low. So the issue might be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has an in-frame stop codon. Let's check the first 30 nucleotides again for any stop codons.

The first 10 codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGG, TTT, CCG, GAA, GAA. None of these are stop codons. So no problem there.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is in the wrong reading frame. If the HA was inserted in a way that shifts the frame, that would cause the rest of the coding sequence to be wrong. But the entire sequence is a multiple of three, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was not correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift. But in that case, the entire sequence would be messed up.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence was inserted in the reverse complement. If the HA was added as the complementary DNA, that would cause the HA to be in the wrong orientation, leading to a frameshift.

But in the provided sequence, the HA is at the beginning, so it's in the correct orientation.

Wait, maybe the HA tag has a stop codon in the middle that's causing the ribosome to stop. Let's see: the HA's codons are 1-10. No stop codons. Then from 11 onwards, the GADD45G codons. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, the provided plus strand has the coding sequence as given. The person noticed that the sequence is the "plus" strand. So the coding sequence is correct.

But perhaps the person forgot to include a termination codon. Wait, no, the sequence does end with TGA.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was not correctly added, and the GADD45G is not being expressed because the start codon is missing. For example, if the HA sequence is missing, and the start is not present, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon after a few amino acids, leading to a truncated protein. But earlier analysis shows that the HA's codons don't include any stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in the reverse complement. No, because the HA should be in the correct frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. Let me check the 11th codon. The 10th codon is GAA (E), the 11th is GTC (V). So the HA tag ends at the 10th codon (since it's 10 amino acids), and the 11th is the start of GADD45G.

Wait, no, the HA is 10 amino acids, so 30 nt, so codons 1-10 are HA, and 11 onwards are GADD45G. So codon 11 is the first codon of GADD45G.

Looking at codon 11: GTC (V). No stop.

So, I'm starting to think that the problem is not a stop codon in the coding sequence. Then, why isn't the protein overexpressed?

Let me think about the options again. Option C says the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. If the HA and GADD45G are directly fused, perhaps the protein is prone to degradation because the HA epitope is recognized by proteases. Alternatively, the HA might have a signal peptide that directs the protein to the secretory pathway, but without a proper signal peptide, it might be retained in the ER or secreted, leading to lower levels in the cell.

Alternatively, without a linker, the two domains might not fold properly, leading to inclusion bodies and low expression.

But the question is about the plus strand's sequence. So perhaps the coding sequence doesn't include a necessary element, like a termination codon, but we saw that it does.

Wait, the HA tag may have a start codon before the actual start, but the sequence starts with ATG, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has a mutation that creates a stop codon. Let me think: the HA tag's DNA sequence is provided, and if any mutation introduced a stop codon, that would cause the problem.

Looking at the HA's DNA sequence (the first 30 nt):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG.

Each codon is correct and no stops. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence wasn't correctly cloned, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA's insert was 34 nt long, that would cause a frameshift after 34/3=11 codons, leading to a premature stop. But the HA is 10 amino acids, so 30 nt. So perhaps the HA was inserted correctly.

Wait, but perhaps the HA's coding sequence was inserted in reverse, leading to a different reading frame. But in the given sequence, the HA is correctly in frame.

Hmm. This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the possible answers again.

Option C suggests that the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused, perhaps the protein is being degraded.

So, if the HA is missing a linker, the chimeric protein might be recognized by proteases, leading to degradation. So the protein is made but quickly broken down, hence not detected.

In that case, the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes an in-frame stop codon due to a mutation. But I don't see any in the initial part.

Another possibility: the HA tag is not followed by a Kozak sequence, leading to inefficient translation initiation. But the plus strand's sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the HA tag might have introduced a mutation in the start codon. But the first codon is ATG, so that's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early. But I don't see any stop codons until the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a rare codon that the CHO cells can't translate efficiently, leading to low expression. But that's more about expression levels, not a complete lack of expression.

Another option: the HA tag was added as a cDNA without the proper reading frame, causing a frameshift. But the sequence seems to be in frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, but it's present in the mRNA but not in the provided DNA sequence. Wait, no, the provided DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the provided sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the mRNA. For example, a point mutation that changes a codon to a stop. Let me look for any such mutations.

Looking at the first 30 nt: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG.

No stops. So no.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is correct, but during cloning, the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation, leading to a reversed sequence. But the sequence starts with ATG, so it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was not correctly annealed, leading to a missing start codon or something else. But the sequence starts with ATG.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but not necessarily prevent expression. Unless the mutation caused a premature stop codon. But the HA sequence's codons don't have any stops.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Only possible if a stop codon is present. The only stop is at the end.

Option C: No linker, so proteolysis. Possible.

Option D: Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA. Unlikely because all stop codons are universal.

So the only plausible option is C.

The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, modified to include an HA tag at the N-terminus, is not expressing the protein as expected. The provided coding sequence for the plus strand was analyzed to determine the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter the amino acid sequence but would not necessarily prevent the protein from being expressed. The provided sequence does not indicate any premature stop codons or mutations that would prevent translation. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the cause of the lack of expression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   Premature termination would occur if there were an unexpected stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) within the coding sequence before the intended stop at the end. The sequence was carefully scanned, and the only stop codon found is at the very end (TGA). Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   Without a linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G protein, the chimeric protein may be prone to proteolysis. Proteases might recognize the HA tag or the lack of a linker as a signal for degradation, leading to the rapid breakdown of the protein and preventing its accumulation. This is a plausible explanation for the lack of overexpression.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   All stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are universally recognized by release factors in translation. The mouse would have the necessary tRNAs to terminate translation at the stop codon. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the lack of a linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G is causing proteolysis of the nascent protein, leading to its degradation and preventing its accumulation. This aligns with the observation that the protein is not being overexpressed despite the construct being present and the coding sequence appearing intact.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a transgenic mouse model isn't expressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they're overexpressing the GADD45G gene. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To do this, they're using a construct where the coding sequence of GADD45G is modified. They've introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the protein. This probably means they've added a HA tag at the beginning of the protein so they can purify it via affinity methods.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. So they looked into the DNA sequence of their construct's plus strand and found an issue.

Looking at the options, let's think about what each could mean.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag is altered, potentially making it not recognizable for purification. But the problem is about overexpression, not whether the protein can be purified. Although if the HA tag is mutated, the protein might not be properly expressed or could be misfolded, but the question says the issue is in the plus strand sequence, so perhaps the HA is correct. Not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Ribosomes stop at stop codons. If the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated. Looking at the provided sequence, I can scan for stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). Let me look through the sequence. Hmm, let's see. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then it goes through various codons. Let me see if there's a TAA, TAG, or TGA anywhere.

Looking at the end, I see ...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

I'll scan for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let me go through the sequence letter by letter.

Looking at the end, the last part is ...TGA. Wait, I see TGA towards the very end. Let me see. The last part is GAGTGA. So the last codons are GAG (which is glutamic acid) followed by TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence ends with TGA. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start is ATG, and the stop codon is at the end.

So if the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA, that's a stop codon. But wait, the way the construct is designed matters. If the HA tag is added before the GADD45G coding sequence, then the start codon is still ATG, and the stop should be at the end of the GADD45G coding sequence. However, perhaps the construct was designed to include the HA tag as a fusion, so the end of the HA would be before the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag has its own stop codon, or the GADD45G sequence was not correctly appended. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is disrupting the reading frame, but if they used the correct in-frame tag, that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, another thought: the plasmid was designed to express the HA-tagged GADD45G. So the coding sequence should be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA is followed by a stop codon, that would end translation prematurely, but in this case, the provided sequence doesn't have a stop codon until the very end.

Wait, the construct's coding sequence is provided as the plus strand. Let me count the triplet codons to see if the stop is correctly placed.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mutation in the HA tag. But the problem is about overexpression not happening.

Let me think about the options again. Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the coding sequence before the actual end. Looking at the sequence, the end has TGA. So wait, that's the last codon. The last few nucleotides are ...CTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA. So the protein would stop at that point. But that's the actual end of the coding sequence, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not followed correctly. Let me think about how the HA tag is added. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should start with the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was inserted incorrectly. For example, if the HA tag's coding sequence had a stop codon in the middle, that would cause the ribosome to stop early, truncating the protein. So if the HA tag's coding sequence had a TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame, that would be a problem.

Looking at the plus strand sequence, the beginning is ATG, then TAC (Tyr), then CCAT... Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence would be a short addition. Let me see the initial part of the provided sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... 

Wait, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then TAC (tyrosine), then GAT (aspartic acid), then G... Hmm, the HA tag is a small peptide, so perhaps the HA coding sequence is at the beginning. Let me think, the HA tag is 11 amino acids long. So the coding sequence for HA would be about 33 nucleotides. Let's see.

The HA sequence (antigenic determinant) is added as a sequence. So the plasmid's coding sequence begins with the HA coding sequence, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But in the given sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's the start of the HA tag? Or perhaps not. Let me think about the HA tag's amino acid sequence. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. A common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is shorter. Let me think about the nucleotide sequence.

Wait, the initial codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAA (glutamic acid), etc. So that's the beginning of the HA tag. Wait, but HA tag is a short peptide, perhaps 6 or 11 amino acids. So perhaps the construct's coding sequence for the HA is correct, but if there's a mutation in the HA sequence, that would affect the protein's structure, but not necessarily prevent expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon. For example, if during cloning, the HA tag's sequence was not correctly inserted, perhaps a stop codon was introduced in frame, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

But looking at the given sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G. So no stop codons in the first few. Let me check for any early stop codons in the entire coding sequence.

Looking through the sequence, I need to scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me go through in triplets.

Starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGA GGA GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG GAA GAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAAC GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTTTT GCG AGG AGA GCC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA CCC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, a lot here. Let me look for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Wait, towards the end, I see TGA again. The last part is ...GAGTGA. So that's the last codon. So the entire coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein should be properly terminated there.

But perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not followed by a start codon, but that's unlikely because the HA is at the N-terminus, so the start is at the HA's ATG.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag's coding sequence might have a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. Let me check the beginning. The first few codons are:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GGG (G)
7. TTT (F)
8. CCG (P)
9. GAA (E)
10. GAA (E)
11. GTC (V)
12. CGC (R)
13. GCC (A)
14. CAG (Q)
15. GAC (D)
16. ACA (T)
17. GTT (V)
18. CCG (P)
19. GAA (E)
20. AGC (S)
21. ACG (T)
22. CCA (P)
23. GGA (G)
24. TGC (C)
25. AGG (R)
26. GTG (V)
27. CC (wait, no, I must group in triplets.)

Wait, perhaps I should group the entire sequence into triplets to look for stop codons.

The entire plus strand is 1056 nucleotides long (since each line is about 72 nt, and there are 14 lines, but maybe less precise; but let's count the letters). Each line is approximately 72 nt, so 14 lines would be 1008 nt. But perhaps I should just group the entire sequence into triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in frame with the GADD45G sequence. If the HA tag is correctly added without a stop codon in the middle, the protein should be expressed. But if the HA tag's coding sequence had a stop codon, that would cause the problem.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag might have a frame shift. For example, if the number of nucleotides added for the HA is not a multiple of three, the reading frame would shift, causing the rest of the coding sequence to be incorrect, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and perhaps a premature stop codon.

Looking at the beginning of the provided sequence, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the first few codons are part of the HA sequence. If the HA's coding sequence was not correctly added, perhaps the reading frame is shifted.

Wait, the HA tag is about 11 amino acids. So the nucleotides should be 33 nt. Let's see: the first 33 nt are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG. Wait, that's 11 codons (33 nt). So that's possible.

Wait, let me count the first few nucleotides:

The first line is 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

But it's written in lines, so perhaps I can count the total length. Alternatively, perhaps there's an early stop codon.

Looking at the coding sequence, I can see that the last codon is TGA. So that's correct. So why isn't the protein overexpressed? The options are about possible causes.

Option C says the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker sequence is often added between the HA tag and the target protein to prevent proteolytic cleavage. If the HA tag is right before GADD45G without a linker, proteases might cleave the HA tag, making the recombinant protein unstable. But the question is about overexpression, not about purification. So if the HA is causing the protein to be cleaved, the protein might not accumulate, hence not overexpressed.

Option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. UAA is a stop codon. All stop codons are recognized by release factors, and if the mRNA is in the mouse, the ribosomes should have the machinery to recognize them. So this is unlikely.

So, the options are A, B, C, D.

If the HA tag is correctly added, but the construct has a premature stop codon, that would cause early termination. But looking at the sequence, the only stop codon is at the very end. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, the plasmid might have been designed without a termination codon, but that's not the case here.

Another possibility is that the sequence has a frameshift. Let me count the nucleotides. The entire sequence is 1056 nt (since the last line ends with 3' which is the end). 1056 divided by 3 is 352 codons. So it's a full-length ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift. For example, if the HA was inserted as +1 or +2, then the reading frame would be wrong for the rest of the gene.

Looking at the first few codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA.

Wait, the first codon is ATG (start), and the rest seem to be in frame. So perhaps the HA is correctly added without a frameshift.

Another angle: the HA tag may require a linker peptide to the GADD45G protein. Without a linker, perhaps the two sequences are incompatible, leading to misfolding or degradation. So if the HA is directly fused to GADD45G, the chimeric protein might not fold properly, leading to aggregation or degradation. This could prevent proper expression, making the protein undetectable. So the issue could be that without a linker, the nascent chain is being degraded by proteases (Option C).

Alternatively, the HA tag may have a signal peptide or some other feature that's causing the protein to be secreted instead of being expressed on the cell surface or retained in the cytoplasm. But that might not directly lead to lack of overexpression if the construct is designed to be secreted.

Another possibility is that the construct doesn't have a poly-A tail or Kozak sequence, but that's more relevant for mRNA stability and initiation of translation. The question says that the issue is in the plus strand sequence, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, the problem is that the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the start codon is correct. But perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking again at the initial codons:

ATG (start), TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGG, TTT, CCG, GAA, GAA, GTC, CGC, GCC, CAG, GAC, ACA, GTT, CCG, GAA, AGC, ACG, CCA, GGA, TGC, AGG, GTG, CC... etc.

Looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the first part. I don't see any early stop codons. The first stop is at the very end.

So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another thought: the HA tag might have introduced a cryptic promoter or something else affecting transcription, but the question is about expression, so perhaps it's more about the mRNA being translated.

Wait, the question says the HA is added at the N-terminus, so the start codon is still the first ATG. So the ribosome should start there, translate the HA, then GADD45G, then stop at the end.

If the protein isn't expressed, perhaps the construct is not being properly transcribed. But the antibiotic resistance was selected, so the construct is present. But perhaps the promoter isn't functional or the terminator is causing issues, but the question is about the coding sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon. Let me count the HA's nucleotides. The HA tag is usually about 30 nucleotides (10 codons) for a 10-mer. Let me see: the first 30 nucleotides are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG. So 10 codons. No stop codons here. So perhaps the HA is correctly added.

Wait, the initial HA coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG. So that's 10 codons, no stops.

So the only stop is at the end. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag is followed by a frame shift. Let me check the number of nucleotides in the HA tag. If it's 30 nt (10 codons), then the rest should be in frame. The total length is 1056 nt, which is 352 codons, so it's correct.

Wait, but the HA tag is perhaps longer. Let me think. The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) is 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. So that part is correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: the HA tag may have a stop codon in the middle because of a mutation. For example, if one of the codons became a stop. Looking at the first 30 nt:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG

These are the first 10 codons. No stops here. So no issue.

Wait, but the coding sequence has a long stretch without any stops until the end. So why isn't the protein expressed? Let me think about the options again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if a stop codon was present before the end. But in the given sequence, the only stop is at the end. So Option B is unlikely.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. Without a linker, the HA tag might be recognized as an epitope that's prone to cleavage. For example, if the HA tag is at the N-terminus and the GADD45G is at the C-terminus, perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be recognized by proteases, leading to degradation and preventing accumulation. So the protein is being made but quickly degraded, hence not detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to stall, leading to insufficient translation. But that's less likely.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is not followed by a Kozak sequence or other elements necessary for efficient translation initiation in mammalian cells. But the question focuses on the coding sequence, not the regulatory regions.

Wait, the construct was transfected into CHO cells, which are mammalian. If the Kozak sequence (which is important for initiation) is missing, the translation may be inefficient. The Kozak sequence is typically around the start codon, with a consensus sequence like 'CCACCAUGG'. Looking at the sequence, the start is ATG, preceded by TAC. So the nucleotides before ATG are TAC. Not sure if that's a problem. But the Kozak sequence is more about the context around the start codon, including nucleotides before and after.

If the Kozak sequence is missing, the ribosome might not initiate translation efficiently, leading to low expression. But the question doesn't mention anything about the promoter or regulatory regions; it's about the coding sequence. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Another thought: the HA tag might have introduced a cryptic splice site or something else, but that's more relevant for mRNA processing, which may not be the case here.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question says that the construct is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus, and the coding sequence is provided. The person observed that the protein wasn't overexpressed. They found that the plus strand sequence has a specific issue.

Looking at the options, option C says the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly attached to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the HA is recognized by proteases. For instance, if the HA tag is followed by a protease cleavage site, the HA might be cleaved off, but the rest of the protein might still function. However, if the HA is causing the entire protein to be recognized as a target for proteolysis, the protein won't accumulate.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold, leading to inclusion bodies or degradation. Without a linker, the two domains (HA and GADD45G) might not fold properly, leading to aggregation and preventing detection.

But the question is about the inability to overexpress. If the protein is being made but quickly degraded, the levels would be low. So the issue might be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has an in-frame stop codon. Let's check the first 30 nucleotides again for any stop codons.

The first 10 codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGG, TTT, CCG, GAA, GAA. None of these are stop codons. So no problem there.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is in the wrong reading frame. If the HA was inserted in a way that shifts the frame, that would cause the rest of the coding sequence to be wrong. But the entire sequence is a multiple of three, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was not correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift. But in that case, the entire sequence would be messed up.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence was inserted in the reverse complement. If the HA was added as the complementary DNA, that would cause the HA to be in the wrong orientation, leading to a frameshift.

But in the provided sequence, the HA is at the beginning, so it's in the correct orientation.

Wait, maybe the HA tag has a stop codon in the middle that's causing the ribosome to stop. Let's see: the HA's codons are 1-10. No stop codons. Then from 11 onwards, the GADD45G codons. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, the provided plus strand has the coding sequence as given. The person noticed that the sequence is the "plus" strand. So the coding sequence is correct.

But perhaps the person forgot to include a termination codon. Wait, no, the sequence does end with TGA.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was not correctly added, and the GADD45G is not being expressed because the start codon is missing. For example, if the HA sequence is missing, and the start is not present, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon after a few amino acids, leading to a truncated protein. But earlier analysis shows that the HA's codons don't include any stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in the reverse complement. No, because the HA should be in the correct frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. Let me check the 11th codon. The 10th codon is GAA (E), the 11th is GTC (V). So the HA tag ends at the 10th codon (since it's 10 amino acids), and the 11th is the start of GADD45G.

Wait, no, the HA is 10 amino acids, so 30 nt, so codons 1-10 are HA, and 11 onwards are GADD45G. So codon 11 is the first codon of GADD45G.

Looking at codon 11: GTC (V). No stop.

So, I'm starting to think that the problem is not a stop codon in the coding sequence. Then, why isn't the protein overexpressed?

Let me think about the options again. Option C says the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. If the HA and GADD45G are directly fused, perhaps the protein is prone to degradation because the HA epitope is recognized by proteases. Alternatively, the HA might have a signal peptide that directs the protein to the secretory pathway, but without a proper signal peptide, it might be retained in the ER or secreted, leading to lower levels in the cell.

Alternatively, without a linker, the two domains might not fold properly, leading to inclusion bodies and low expression.

But the question is about the plus strand's sequence. So perhaps the coding sequence doesn't include a necessary element, like a termination codon, but we saw that it does.

Wait, the HA tag may have a start codon before the actual start, but the sequence starts with ATG, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has a mutation that creates a stop codon. Let me think: the HA tag's DNA sequence is provided, and if any mutation introduced a stop codon, that would cause the problem.

Looking at the HA's DNA sequence (the first 30 nt):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG.

Each codon is correct and no stops. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence wasn't correctly cloned, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA's insert was 34 nt long, that would cause a frameshift after 34/3=11 codons, leading to a premature stop. But the HA is 10 amino acids, so 30 nt. So perhaps the HA was inserted correctly.

Wait, but perhaps the HA's coding sequence was inserted in reverse, leading to a different reading frame. But in the given sequence, the HA is correctly in frame.

Hmm. This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the possible answers again.

Option C suggests that the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused, perhaps the protein is being degraded.

So, if the HA is missing a linker, the chimeric protein might be recognized by proteases, leading to degradation. So the protein is made but quickly broken down, hence not detected.

In that case, the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes an in-frame stop codon due to a mutation. But I don't see any in the initial part.

Another possibility: the HA tag is not followed by a Kozak sequence, leading to inefficient translation initiation. But the plus strand's sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the HA tag might have introduced a mutation in the start codon. But the first codon is ATG, so that's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early. But I don't see any stop codons until the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a rare codon that the CHO cells can't translate efficiently, leading to low expression. But that's more about expression levels, not a complete lack of expression.

Another option: the HA tag was added as a cDNA without the proper reading frame, causing a frameshift. But the sequence seems to be in frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, but it's present in the mRNA but not in the provided DNA sequence. Wait, no, the provided DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the provided sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the mRNA. For example, a point mutation that changes a codon to a stop. Let me look for any such mutations.

Looking at the first 30 nt: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGG TTT CCG.

No stops. So no.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is correct, but during cloning, the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation, leading to a reversed sequence. But the sequence starts with ATG, so it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was not correctly annealed, leading to a missing start codon or something else. But the sequence starts with ATG.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but not necessarily prevent expression. Unless the mutation caused a premature stop codon. But the HA sequence's codons don't have any stops.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Only possible if a stop codon is present. The only stop is at the end.

Option C: No linker, so proteolysis. Possible.

Option D: Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA. Unlikely because all stop codons are universal.

So the only plausible option is C.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, modified to include an HA tag at the N-terminus, is not expressing the protein as expected. The provided coding sequence for the plus strand was analyzed to determine the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter the amino acid sequence but would not necessarily prevent the protein from being expressed. The provided sequence does not indicate any premature stop codons or mutations that would prevent translation. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the cause of the lack of expression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   Premature termination would occur if there were an unexpected stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) within the coding sequence before the intended stop at the end. The sequence was carefully scanned, and the only stop codon found is at the very end (TGA). Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   Without a linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G protein, the chimeric protein may be prone to proteolysis. Proteases might recognize the HA tag or the lack of a linker as a signal for degradation, leading to the rapid breakdown of the protein and preventing its accumulation. This is a plausible explanation for the lack of overexpression.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   All stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are universally recognized by release factors in translation. The mouse would have the necessary tRNAs to terminate translation at the stop codon. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the lack of a linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G is causing proteolysis of the nascent protein, leading to its degradation and preventing its accumulation. This aligns with the observation that the protein is not being overexpressed despite the construct being present and the coding sequence appearing intact.

**Answer: C**
