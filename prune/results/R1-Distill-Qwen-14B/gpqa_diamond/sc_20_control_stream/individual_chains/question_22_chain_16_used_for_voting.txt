Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The statement is incomplete: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." And we have to choose the correct combination from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the effectiveness of an oxidant can be looked at from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. Thermodynamic relates to the feasibility (like ΔG) and kinetic relates to the speed of the reaction.

So for the first part: Thermodynamically, oxygen as an oxidant in basic solutions. I think about standard reduction potentials. In basic solutions, the concentration of H+ is low, but OH- is high. The standard reduction potential for O2 is given under certain conditions—usually in acidic or standard conditions.

Wait, the standard E° for O2 is under acidic conditions, right? Because the half-reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which is in acidic solution. So in basic solutions, the same reaction wouldn't be as favorable because the H+ isn't available. So the E° would change because of the pH.

Wait, but when you adjust the pH, the effective cell potential changes. Using the Nernst equation, the E will change when you have different pH. So in basic solution, since OH- is high, the effective E for the oxygen reduction would be lower. That would make O2 a weaker oxidant in basic solutions because the E is lower. Because a higher E means a stronger oxidizing agent. For example, if under standard conditions O2 has a high E°, but in basic solution, the E is lower, so it's a weaker oxidant.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The standard E is for specific conditions (like 1M concentrations, 1 atm pressure, etc.). For O2 in basic solution, the actual E is lower because the reaction is run under different H+ conditions. So the oxidizing power (E°) is lower in basic solution. So thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solution compared to acidic. Wait, no, because the question says "in basic solutions" for the first part. So the statement is that, thermodynamically, O2 is a [blank] oxidant in basic solutions. So if in standard conditions (acidic), O2 is a stronger oxidant, but in basic, it's a weaker one. Because the E decreases in basic solution.

So the first blank should be "weaker" oxidant in basic solutions. Because in basic solutions, the E is lower, making it less likely to act as a strong oxidant.

Now the second part: Kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic solutions? Kinetics is about the rate of reaction, which depends on factors like activation energy, catalysts, concentration, etc. O2 is a molecule that's a bit inert kinetically. It doesn't react very quickly unless there's a catalyst. But in acidic conditions, maybe the reaction is faster because the H+ can help in the reaction mechanism.

Wait, for example, in acidic conditions, O2 can react more quickly because the H+ ions might facilitate the reaction. Like, in the oxygen reduction reaction, H+ is part of the reaction. So in acidic solution, having higher H+ could make the reaction proceed faster.

Alternatively, I've heard that O2 is a strong oxidant thermodynamically but has a high activation energy, making the reaction slow kinetically. So in acidic solutions, the reaction is more favorable (thermodynamic) but does it proceed faster? Or wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think.

In acidic solutions, the reaction O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O has a higher concentration of H+ ions. But I'm not sure if that makes the reaction faster. Alternatively, maybe in acidic conditions, the reaction is more feasible thermodynamically, but the kinetic barriers are lower, so the reaction is faster because of better proton availability. Or perhaps, in more acidic conditions, the rate is higher because the reaction is more spontaneous, so the activation energy is somehow lower.

Wait, maybe the kinetic part refers to the rate of reaction. For O2 to act as an oxidant, the reaction's rate (kinetics) depends on how easily it can react. In acidic solutions, reactions involving O2 might be faster because H+ can stabilize transition states or intermediates. For instance, in acidic conditions, the reaction can proceed through protonated intermediates which can lower the activation energy.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (compared to acidic), and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Wait, no—wait. The statement says, "kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." So the blank is about how it reacts in acidic—faster or slower? So if in acidic solutions the reaction is faster, then the blank is 'faster'. 

So the blanks would be: weaker and faster. Looking at the options:

Option C) weaker – faster
Option D) weaker – slower

Wait, no, the question says that in the first part, it's in basic solutions. The second part is about acidic solutions. So the first blank is in basic, and the second in acidic.

So the first blank is weaker, and the second is faster. So the correct combination is weaker and faster. Looking at the options, option C is weaker – faster.

Wait, let me cross-check. Because I might have mixed up the concepts. Another approach: thermodynamic strength is about E°. Higher E° means stronger oxidant. In basic solutions, the E° for O2 would be lower than in acidic because pH affects E. So in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant (so first part is weaker). 

For the kinetic part, in acidic solutions, the reaction might be faster because there are more H+ ions, which could lower the activation energy. So O2 reacts faster in acidic solutions. So the second part is faster.

So the combination should be weaker and faster, which is option C.

To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the roles of thermodynamics and kinetics in the context of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Perspective**:  
   Thermodynamic strength of an oxidant is determined by its reduction potential (E°). In basic solutions, the reduction potential of oxygen (O₂) is lower than in acidic solutions because the reaction conditions differ. Specifically, the standard reduction reaction for oxygen involves H⁺ ions, which are less available in basic solutions. As a result, oxygen is a **weaker oxidant** in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Perspective**:  
   Kinetic factors determine the rate of reaction. In acidic solutions, the high concentration of H⁺ ions facilitates the reaction mechanism involving oxygen. These ions can stabilize intermediates or lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. Therefore, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.

Combining these insights, the correct terms are **weaker** for the thermodynamic aspect in basic solutions and **faster** for the kinetic aspect in acidic solutions. This matches the combination in **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The standard reduction potential for O2 is given under certain conditions—usually in acidic or standard conditions.

So the statement is that, thermodynamically, O2 is a [blank] oxidant in basic solutions. So if in standard conditions (acidic), O2 is a stronger oxidant, but in basic, it's a weaker one. Because the E decreases in basic solution.

So the first blank should be "weaker" oxidant in basic solutions. Because in basic solutions, the E is lower, making it less likely to act as a strong oxidant.

Now the second part: Kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic solutions? Kinetics is about the rate of reaction, which depends on factors like activation energy, catalysts, concentration, etc. O2 is a molecule that's a bit inert kinetically. It doesn't react very quickly unless there's a catalyst. But in acidic conditions, maybe the reaction is faster because the H+ can help in the reaction mechanism.

In acidic solutions, reactions involving O2 might be faster because H+ can stabilize transition states or intermediates.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (compared to acidic), and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Wait, no—wait. The statement says, "kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." So the blank is about how it reacts in acidic—faster or slower? So if in acidic solutions the reaction is faster, then the blank is 'faster'. 

So the blanks would be: weaker and faster. Looking at the options:

Option C) weaker – faster
Option D) weaker – slower

Wait, no, the question says that in the first part, it's in basic solutions. The second part is about acidic solutions. So the first blank is in basic, and the second in acidic.

So the first blank is weaker, and the second is faster. So the correct combination is weaker and faster. Looking at the options, option C is weaker – faster.

Wait, let me cross-check. Because I might have mixed up the concepts. Another approach: thermodynamic strength is about E°. Higher E° means stronger oxidant. In basic solutions, the E° for O2 would be lower than in acidic because pH affects E. So in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant (so first part is weaker). 

For the kinetic part, in acidic solutions, the reaction might be faster because there are more H+ ions, which could lower the activation energy. So O2 reacts faster in acidic solutions. So the second part is faster.

So the combination should be weaker and faster, which is option C.
