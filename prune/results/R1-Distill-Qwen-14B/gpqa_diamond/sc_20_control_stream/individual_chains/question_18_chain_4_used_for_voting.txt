Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their compositions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. 

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me their masses, but I don't think the masses matter directly here since we're dealing with elemental abundances. The main data points are the abundance ratios they've provided.

Let me jot down what I know:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] or something like that. Or wait, the ratio is [nSi1 / nSi2], I think.

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's (nSi1)/(nSi2). Right.

Alright, how do I get nSi for each star?

I think I need to figure out [Si/H] for each star because that would give me the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen. Then I can compute (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 / nH2) multiplied by (nH2 / nH1). Wait, but the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 would require comparing their [Si/H], but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, no. Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So, [X/H]_star = log(nX/nH)_star - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_a = log(nXa /nYa) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun). So, [X/Y]_a = log( (nXa / nYa) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) )

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( nSi1 / nFe1 ) - log( nSisun / nFesun ) = 0.3.

But I also know [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe1 /nH1 ) - log(nFesun /nHsun )=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFesun/nHsun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

Wait, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

But I also have the Sun's nFe/nH value. From the problem statement, the Sun's 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

So, for Star_1, nFe1 = 3.16e-5 × nH1.

But how does that help me get nSi1?

I also have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. Which is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSisun/nFesun) =0.3.

Wait, log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nFesun).

From the Sun's data, nSisun/nFesun is 10^{ log(nSisun/nFesun) }, but wait, I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] given. Oh wait, the Sun's [X/H] is given for Fe and Mg. But the Sun's [Si/Fe] can be calculated if I know their individual abundances.

Wait, for the Sun, nFe/nH is known. But what about nSi/nH? Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that directly. Hmm. So maybe I can't compute [Si/Fe]_Sun directly. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, let's see. Let me recap the data given.

Solar values:

12 + log(nFe/H) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

But for the Sun, nH_sun is 1 (by definition), so nFe1 =3.16e-5 ×nH1.

But we need to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then compute (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) × (nH2 /nH1) → but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the ratio is (nSi1) / (nSi2) = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ] × (nH1/nH2) × (nH2/nH2) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express nSi in terms of nFe for each star, then relate using [Fe/H], and then compute the ratio.

Let's tackle Star_1 first.

Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nFesun).

Wait, but I don't know nSisun/nFesun. Hmm. Or maybe I can find it from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is what? Well, the Sun's [X/Y] is log(nX/nY)_Sun - log(nX/nY)_Sun =0, so that doesn't help. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y]_Sun is 0. So [Si/Fe]_Sun is 0.

Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun). So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1 /nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun /nFe_sun. Hmm, this is a problem. Because without knowing that ratio, I can't directly compute log(nSi1/nFe1).

Wait, but perhaps I can work around it. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/H] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Wait, yes! Because:

log(nSi/nH) = log(nSi/nFe) + log(nFe/nH) → [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H].

Ah, that makes sense. So for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → which is log(nSi1/nH1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

But wait, the [X/H] is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, for Star_1:

log(nSi1/nH1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

Which is 0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

But I don't have nSisun/nHsun. Hmm. Wait, do I have any way to find that? Oh wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si] for Star_2 and [Mg/H] for Star_2. Maybe that's a clue for the Sun's [Mg/Si], but not directly for Si.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/H] can be calculated from other data. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed without knowing the exact value because it might cancel out.

Let me think again. Let me write the [Si/H] for each star.

Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

Star_2:

I need to find [Si/H]_2. Let's see. But how?

Wait, Star_2's given data includes [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun).

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMgsun/nHsun).

So from [Mg/H]_2, nMg2/nH2 = nMgsun/nHsun. So nMg2 = (nMgsun/nHsun) × nH2.

But I also have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun).

Substituting nMg2 from above:

log( [ (nMgsun/nHsun) × nH2 ] / nSi2 ) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun )

Let me rearrange this:

log( (nMgsun × nH2 ) / (nHsun × nSi2) ) = 0.3 + log( nMgsun / nSisun )

That can be written as log( (nMgsun / nHsun) × (nH2 /nSi2) ) = 0.3 + log( nMgsun /nSisun )

Which is log( (nMgsun /nHsun) ) + log( nH2 / nSi2 ) = 0.3 + log( nMgsun /nSisun )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Perhaps I can express nH2 in terms of the Sun's hydrogen.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the star's hydrogen abundance. But perhaps we can assume that for both stars, the hydrogen abundance is the same? Or does it not matter?

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars is (nSi1 / nSi2 ) = (nSi1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the ratio would be (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 / nH2) ) × (nH2 / nH1) → but that's (nSi1 /nH1) divided by (nSi2/nH2) multiplied by (nH2/nH1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the ratio is (nSi1 /nH1 ) * (nH2 /nH1 )^{-1} * (nH2 /nSi2 )^{-1} → No, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) → which is (nSi1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2) ) → which is (nSi1 nH2 )/(nH1 nSi2).

But to find this ratio, I need to know [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, and the ratio of nH1 to nH2.

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of nH1 to nH2. Unless, perhaps, I can relate them via the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] given. Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMgsun/nHsun.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to relate the Hydrogen in the two stars. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is the same in both stars because the problem doesn't mention any change in that. Wait, but that might not be correct because stars can have different abundances. However, the problem doesn't give any information about the total metallicity beyond Fe and Mg, so perhaps the hydrogen is the same for both stars? Or perhaps I can assume that the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't state anything about the hydrogen content or the overall metallicity except for Fe and Mg.

Wait, but in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMgsun/nHsun.

But for the Sun, the ratio of nFe to nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg to nH is 1e-5.

So, nFe1 = (nFesun/nHsun) ×nH1.

Similarly, nMg2 = (nMgsun/nHsun) ×nH2.

But how does that help me find nSi1 and nSi2?

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe] is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSisun/nFesun) =0.3.

We know that nFe1 = (nFesun /nHsun) ×nH1.

So, substituting:

log( (nSi1) / ( (nFesun /nHsun) ×nH1 ) ) - log( nSisun/nFesun ) = 0.3.

Simplify:

log(nSi1) - log(nFesun/nHsun) - log(nH1) - [ log(nSisun) - log(nFesun) ] =0.3

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSisun/nFesun) ) ) =0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nFesun).

But nFe1 = (nFesun /nHsun) *nH1.

So:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSisun / nFesun) → substituting nFe1,

nSi1 = ( (nFesun /nHsun) *nH1 ) * 10^{0.3} * (nSisun /nFesun) )

The nFesun cancels out:

nSi1 = (nSisun /nHsun) * 10^{0.3} * nH1.

But (nSisun/nHsun) is the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio, which I don't know. Hmm, but perhaps I can relate it to the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_1 =0.3 as I did earlier. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

[Si/H] is log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSisun/nHsun) )=0.3 → So,

log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun)

Which implies that nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun) = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun).

So, nSi1 = nH1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun) )

Similarly, for Star_2, I need to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun)

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMgsun/nHsun)

So, nMg2 = nH2 * (nMgsun/nHsun).

But I can also express nMg2 as (nMg2) = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun) )

Wait, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun) → So, nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun /nSisun).

But we also have nMg2 = nH2 * (nMgsun/nHsun).

So:

nH2 * (nMgsun/nHsun) = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun).

We can cancel nMgsun from both sides:

nH2 /nHsun = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} / nSisun.

Rearranged:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nHsun) * nSisun / (10^{0.3})

But we don't know nH2 or nHsun. Wait, but nHsun is 1 (by definition), so nH2/nHsun =nH2.

Wait, but without knowing nH2, perhaps I can express nSi2 in terms of nH2.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun) = ?

Hmm, but I don't have direct info on [Si/H]_2. So perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2 using the given data.

Wait, let's try to express [Si/H]_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun) → As before.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMgsun/nHsun) → So, nMg2/nH2 =nMgsun/nHsun → nMg2 = nH2 (nMgsun/nHsun).

Putting this into the [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun) → nH2 (nMgsun/nHsun) ) = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} (nMgsun/nSisun)

Cancel nMgsun:

nH2 /nHsun = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} / nSisun.

Rearranged → nSi2 = (nH2 nSisun) / (nHsun * 10^{0.3} )

But nHsun is 1, so nSi2 = (nH2 *nSisun) / (10^{0.3} )

Now, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun) )

Substitute nSi2:

nSi2/nH2 = (nSisun) / (10^{0.3} )

So,

log( (nSisun /10^{0.3}) / (nSisun) ) → log( 1/(10^{0.3}) ) = log(10^{-0.3}) = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = (-0.3) - log(nSisun/nHsun).

Wait, no. Wait, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun).

But nSi2/nH2 = (nSisun)/(10^{0.3} )

So log( (nSisun)/(10^{0.3} nH2) ) → wait, no, nH2 is in denominator.

Wait, nSi2/nH2 = (nSisun)/(10^{0.3} )

So log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSisun) - log(10^{0.3} )

Which is log(nSisun) - 0.3.

Then, [Si/H]_2 = (log(nSisun) -0.3) - log(nSisun) ) = -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

But wait, what is [Si/H]_2? It's log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun) =-0.3.

But we're trying to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2, which is (nSi1 /nH1 )/(nSi2 /nH2 ) ) × (nH2 /nH1 ) → (nSi1 nH2)/(nSi2 nH1 )

But wait, I'm not sure if I should include the H ratio because the problem asks for the silicon ratio, not relative to hydrogen. Hmm.

Wait, the question is "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's nSi1 / nSi2.

But to find this, I can express nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2.

From Star_1:

nSi1 = nH1 × 10^{0.3} × (nSisun/nHsun)

From Star_2:

nSi2 = (nH2 × nSisun) / (10^{0.3} )

So, the ratio:

nSi1/nSi2 = [nH1 × 10^{0.3} × (nSisun/nHsun) ] / [ (nH2 × nSisun) / (10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1 /nH2) × [10^{0.3} × (nSisun/nHsun) ] × [10^{0.3} / nSisun ]

The nSisun cancels out:

= (nH1 /nH2 ) × (10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ) * (1/(nHsun )) )

Which is:

= (nH1 /nH2 ) × 10^{0.6} * (1/nHsun )

But wait, nHsun is 1, so it's just 1. So,

nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1 /nH2) × 10^{0.6}.

But we don't know the ratio of nH1 to nH2. Hmm, so maybe I'm stuck here.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen content is the same for both stars? Or perhaps the ratio of hydrogen is 1, meaning nH1 =nH2.

Is there any data to support that? The problem doesn't give any information about hydrogen in the stars beyond what's implied by [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFesun/nHsun → which is 3.16e-5.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMgsun/nHsun=1e-5.

But without knowing the total hydrogen in each star, I can't find nH1 and nH2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars. Or perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined from their masses? But I don't think that's correct because stellar mass doesn't directly translate to photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that nH1 =nH2. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Wait, let me think. The problem gives the [Fe/H] for Star_1 and [Mg/H] for Star_2. But for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which is solar. So, nFe1 =3.16e-5 *nH1.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2=1e-5 *nH2.

But without any other information, I can't find the ratio of nH1 and nH2.

Hmm, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the H ratio because the ratio of Si would be the same if the H ratio is 1.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the possible answers are numbers like ~3.9, ~12.6, ~0.8, ~1.2. These are all numbers that don't require any H ratio; perhaps the H ratio cancels out.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Given that in Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1 =nFesun * (nH1/nH_sun ), but nH_sun is 1, so nFe1=3.16e-5 *nH1.

Star_1's [Si/Fe]=0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSisun/nFesun) =0.3.

So,

log(nSi1/(3.16e-5 *nH1)) )= 0.3 + log(nSisun/(3.16e-5)).

Wait, but nSisun is given? No, because we don't have the Sun's nSi/nH.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio of nSi1/nH1 and nSi2/nH2, then take the ratio.

So,

For Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun)

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → log(nSi2/nH2) = -0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun)

Which is nSi2/nH2=10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun)

So the ratio of nSi1/nH1 to nSi2/nH2 is:

(10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun)) / (10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )) )

= 10^{0.6} = about 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4.

But wait, this is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )= 10^{0.6} → 10^{0.6} is about 3.98.

But the question is the ratio of Si atoms, which is (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2/nH1 )) ? No, wait, no. Wait, no, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) ) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2/nH1) ) → No, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1 ) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 * nH2 )

So, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) * (nH1/nH2 ) / (nH1/nH2 )

Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) is 10^{0.6 }, and if we assume that nH1/nH2 =1 (same number of hydrogens), then the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But I don't know if nH1 equals nH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute number of H, and just asks for the ratio of silicon relative to each star's H, which would make the ratio of Si (nSi1/nH1) over (nSi2/nH2 )=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But the question is the ratio of silicon atoms, which is (nSi1)/(nSi2 ), which could be different if the H abundance varies.

Wait, but without knowing the H ratio, how can we calculate the Si ratio? Unless the problem implies that the H ratio is 1, meaning same number of H in both stars.

But the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's re-express everything.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi1/nH1 =10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2= -0.3 → nSi2/nH2 =10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

So,

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

nSi2/nH2 =10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is ~4. So the answer would be approximately 4, which is option A.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which is (nSi1) / (nSi2).

But without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, I can't find (nSi1/nSi2 ) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 * nH2 )

Which is [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

So unless nH1/nH2 is 1, I can't proceed. But the problem doesn't give any data about the H content of the stars beyond what's implied by [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the two stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms, making nH1/nH2=1. If that's the case, then (nSi1/nSi2 )= (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ) )=10^{0.6}≈3.98, so the answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.

But I think the problem is structured such that the H ratio is 1, so the ratio of silicon is approximately 4. So I think the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1 × 10⁻⁵

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]
  Since \( n_{\text{H, Sun}} = 1 \), \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \).

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}}\right).
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \), we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]
  Since \( n_{\text{H, Sun}} = 1 \), \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \).

- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}\right).
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \), we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]
Assuming the hydrogen content is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Since \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon atoms is approximately **4.0**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their compositions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. 

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me their masses, but I don't think the masses matter directly here since we're dealing with elemental abundances. The main data points are the abundance ratios they've provided.

Let me jot down what I know:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] or something like that. Or wait, the ratio is [nSi1 / nSi2], I think.

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's (nSi1)/(nSi2). Right.

Alright, how do I get nSi for each star?

I think I need to figure out [Si/H] for each star because that would give me the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen. Then I can compute (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 / nH2) multiplied by (nH2 / nH1). Wait, but the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 would require comparing their [Si/H], but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, no. Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So, [X/H]_star = log(nX/nH)_star - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_a = log(nXa /nYa) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun). So, [X/Y]_a = log( (nXa / nYa) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) )

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( nSi1 / nFe1 ) - log( nSisun / nFesun ) = 0.3.

But I also know [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe1 /nH1 ) - log(nFesun /nHsun )=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFesun/nHsun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

Wait, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

But I also have the Sun's nFe/nH value. From the problem statement, the Sun's 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

So, for Star_1, nFe1 = 3.16e-5 × nH1.

But how does that help me get nSi1?

I also have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. Which is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSisun/nFesun) =0.3.

Wait, log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nFesun).

From the Sun's data, nSisun/nFesun is 10^{ log(nSisun/nFesun) }, but wait, I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] given. Oh wait, the Sun's [X/H] is given for Fe and Mg. But the Sun's [Si/Fe] can be calculated if I know their individual abundances.

Wait, for the Sun, nFe/nH is known. But what about nSi/nH? Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that directly. Hmm. So maybe I can't compute [Si/Fe]_Sun directly. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, let's see. Let me recap the data given.

Solar values:

12 + log(nFe/H) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

But for the Sun, nH_sun is 1 (by definition), so nFe1 =3.16e-5 ×nH1.

But we need to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then compute (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) × (nH2 /nH1) → but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the ratio is (nSi1) / (nSi2) = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ] × (nH1/nH2) × (nH2/nH2) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express nSi in terms of nFe for each star, then relate using [Fe/H], and then compute the ratio.

Let's tackle Star_1 first.

Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nFesun).

Wait, but I don't know nSisun/nFesun. Hmm. Or maybe I can find it from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is what? Well, the Sun's [X/Y] is log(nX/nY)_Sun - log(nX/nY)_Sun =0, so that doesn't help. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y]_Sun is 0. So [Si/Fe]_Sun is 0.

Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun). So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1 /nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun /nFe_sun. Hmm, this is a problem. Because without knowing that ratio, I can't directly compute log(nSi1/nFe1).

Wait, but perhaps I can work around it. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/H] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Wait, yes! Because:

log(nSi/nH) = log(nSi/nFe) + log(nFe/nH) → [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H].

Ah, that makes sense. So for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → which is log(nSi1/nH1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

But wait, the [X/H] is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, for Star_1:

log(nSi1/nH1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

Which is 0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

But I don't have nSisun/nHsun. Hmm. Wait, do I have any way to find that? Oh wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si] for Star_2 and [Mg/H] for Star_2. Maybe that's a clue for the Sun's [Mg/Si], but not directly for Si.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/H] can be calculated from other data. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed without knowing the exact value because it might cancel out.

Let me think again. Let me write the [Si/H] for each star.

Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun).

Star_2:

I need to find [Si/H]_2. Let's see. But how?

Wait, Star_2's given data includes [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun).

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMgsun/nHsun).

So from [Mg/H]_2, nMg2/nH2 = nMgsun/nHsun. So nMg2 = (nMgsun/nHsun) × nH2.

But I also have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun).

Substituting nMg2 from above:

log( [ (nMgsun/nHsun) × nH2 ] / nSi2 ) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun )

Let me rearrange this:

log( (nMgsun × nH2 ) / (nHsun × nSi2) ) = 0.3 + log( nMgsun / nSisun )

That can be written as log( (nMgsun / nHsun) × (nH2 /nSi2) ) = 0.3 + log( nMgsun /nSisun )

Which is log( (nMgsun /nHsun) ) + log( nH2 / nSi2 ) = 0.3 + log( nMgsun /nSisun )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Perhaps I can express nH2 in terms of the Sun's hydrogen.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the star's hydrogen abundance. But perhaps we can assume that for both stars, the hydrogen abundance is the same? Or does it not matter?

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars is (nSi1 / nSi2 ) = (nSi1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the ratio would be (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 / nH2) ) × (nH2 / nH1) → but that's (nSi1 /nH1) divided by (nSi2/nH2) multiplied by (nH2/nH1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the ratio is (nSi1 /nH1 ) * (nH2 /nH1 )^{-1} * (nH2 /nSi2 )^{-1} → No, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) → which is (nSi1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2) ) → which is (nSi1 nH2 )/(nH1 nSi2).

But to find this ratio, I need to know [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, and the ratio of nH1 to nH2.

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of nH1 to nH2. Unless, perhaps, I can relate them via the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] given. Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMgsun/nHsun.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to relate the Hydrogen in the two stars. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is the same in both stars because the problem doesn't mention any change in that. Wait, but that might not be correct because stars can have different abundances. However, the problem doesn't give any information about the total metallicity beyond Fe and Mg, so perhaps the hydrogen is the same for both stars? Or perhaps I can assume that the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't state anything about the hydrogen content or the overall metallicity except for Fe and Mg.

Wait, but in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe1/nH1 = nFesun/nHsun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMgsun/nHsun.

But for the Sun, the ratio of nFe to nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg to nH is 1e-5.

So, nFe1 = (nFesun/nHsun) ×nH1.

Similarly, nMg2 = (nMgsun/nHsun) ×nH2.

But how does that help me find nSi1 and nSi2?

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe] is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSisun/nFesun) =0.3.

We know that nFe1 = (nFesun /nHsun) ×nH1.

So, substituting:

log( (nSi1) / ( (nFesun /nHsun) ×nH1 ) ) - log( nSisun/nFesun ) = 0.3.

Simplify:

log(nSi1) - log(nFesun/nHsun) - log(nH1) - [ log(nSisun) - log(nFesun) ] =0.3

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSisun/nFesun) ) ) =0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nFesun).

But nFe1 = (nFesun /nHsun) *nH1.

So:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSisun / nFesun) → substituting nFe1,

nSi1 = ( (nFesun /nHsun) *nH1 ) * 10^{0.3} * (nSisun /nFesun) )

The nFesun cancels out:

nSi1 = (nSisun /nHsun) * 10^{0.3} * nH1.

But (nSisun/nHsun) is the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio, which I don't know. Hmm, but perhaps I can relate it to the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_1 =0.3 as I did earlier. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

[Si/H] is log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSisun/nHsun) )=0.3 → So,

log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun)

Which implies that nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun) = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun).

So, nSi1 = nH1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun) )

Similarly, for Star_2, I need to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun)

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMgsun/nHsun)

So, nMg2 = nH2 * (nMgsun/nHsun).

But I can also express nMg2 as (nMg2) = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun) )

Wait, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun) → So, nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun /nSisun).

But we also have nMg2 = nH2 * (nMgsun/nHsun).

So:

nH2 * (nMgsun/nHsun) = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun).

We can cancel nMgsun from both sides:

nH2 /nHsun = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} / nSisun.

Rearranged:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nHsun) * nSisun / (10^{0.3})

But we don't know nH2 or nHsun. Wait, but nHsun is 1 (by definition), so nH2/nHsun =nH2.

Wait, but without knowing nH2, perhaps I can express nSi2 in terms of nH2.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun) = ?

Hmm, but I don't have direct info on [Si/H]_2. So perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2 using the given data.

Wait, let's try to express [Si/H]_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMgsun/nSisun) → As before.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMgsun/nHsun) → So, nMg2/nH2 =nMgsun/nHsun → nMg2 = nH2 (nMgsun/nHsun).

Putting this into the [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} * (nMgsun/nSisun) → nH2 (nMgsun/nHsun) ) = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} (nMgsun/nSisun)

Cancel nMgsun:

nH2 /nHsun = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} / nSisun.

Rearranged → nSi2 = (nH2 nSisun) / (nHsun * 10^{0.3} )

But nHsun is 1, so nSi2 = (nH2 *nSisun) / (10^{0.3} )

Now, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun) )

Substitute nSi2:

nSi2/nH2 = (nSisun) / (10^{0.3} )

So,

log( (nSisun /10^{0.3}) / (nSisun) ) → log( 1/(10^{0.3}) ) = log(10^{-0.3}) = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = (-0.3) - log(nSisun/nHsun).

Wait, no. Wait, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun).

But nSi2/nH2 = (nSisun)/(10^{0.3} )

So log( (nSisun)/(10^{0.3} nH2) ) → wait, no, nH2 is in denominator.

Wait, nSi2/nH2 = (nSisun)/(10^{0.3} )

So log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSisun) - log(10^{0.3} )

Which is log(nSisun) - 0.3.

Then, [Si/H]_2 = (log(nSisun) -0.3) - log(nSisun) ) = -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

But wait, what is [Si/H]_2? It's log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSisun/nHsun) =-0.3.

But we're trying to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2, which is (nSi1 /nH1 )/(nSi2 /nH2 ) ) × (nH2 /nH1 ) → (nSi1 nH2)/(nSi2 nH1 )

But wait, I'm not sure if I should include the H ratio because the problem asks for the silicon ratio, not relative to hydrogen. Hmm.

Wait, the question is "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's nSi1 / nSi2.

But to find this, I can express nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2.

From Star_1:

nSi1 = nH1 × 10^{0.3} × (nSisun/nHsun)

From Star_2:

nSi2 = (nH2 × nSisun) / (10^{0.3} )

So, the ratio:

nSi1/nSi2 = [nH1 × 10^{0.3} × (nSisun/nHsun) ] / [ (nH2 × nSisun) / (10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1 /nH2) × [10^{0.3} × (nSisun/nHsun) ] × [10^{0.3} / nSisun ]

The nSisun cancels out:

= (nH1 /nH2 ) × (10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ) * (1/(nHsun )) )

Which is:

= (nH1 /nH2 ) × 10^{0.6} * (1/nHsun )

But wait, nHsun is 1, so it's just 1. So,

nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1 /nH2) × 10^{0.6}.

But we don't know the ratio of nH1 to nH2. Hmm, so maybe I'm stuck here.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen content is the same for both stars? Or perhaps the ratio of hydrogen is 1, meaning nH1 =nH2.

Is there any data to support that? The problem doesn't give any information about hydrogen in the stars beyond what's implied by [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFesun/nHsun → which is 3.16e-5.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMgsun/nHsun=1e-5.

But without knowing the total hydrogen in each star, I can't find nH1 and nH2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars. Or perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined from their masses? But I don't think that's correct because stellar mass doesn't directly translate to photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that nH1 =nH2. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Wait, let me think. The problem gives the [Fe/H] for Star_1 and [Mg/H] for Star_2. But for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which is solar. So, nFe1 =3.16e-5 *nH1.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2=1e-5 *nH2.

But without any other information, I can't find the ratio of nH1 and nH2.

Hmm, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the H ratio because the ratio of Si would be the same if the H ratio is 1.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the possible answers are numbers like ~3.9, ~12.6, ~0.8, ~1.2. These are all numbers that don't require any H ratio; perhaps the H ratio cancels out.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Given that in Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1 =nFesun * (nH1/nH_sun ), but nH_sun is 1, so nFe1=3.16e-5 *nH1.

Star_1's [Si/Fe]=0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSisun/nFesun) =0.3.

So,

log(nSi1/(3.16e-5 *nH1)) )= 0.3 + log(nSisun/(3.16e-5)).

Wait, but nSisun is given? No, because we don't have the Sun's nSi/nH.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio of nSi1/nH1 and nSi2/nH2, then take the ratio.

So,

For Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun)

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → log(nSi2/nH2) = -0.3 + log(nSisun/nHsun)

Which is nSi2/nH2=10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun)

So the ratio of nSi1/nH1 to nSi2/nH2 is:

(10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun)) / (10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )) )

= 10^{0.6} = about 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4.

But wait, this is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )= 10^{0.6} → 10^{0.6} is about 3.98.

But the question is the ratio of Si atoms, which is (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2/nH1 )) ? No, wait, no. Wait, no, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) ) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2/nH1) ) → No, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1 ) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 * nH2 )

So, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) * (nH1/nH2 ) / (nH1/nH2 )

Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) is 10^{0.6 }, and if we assume that nH1/nH2 =1 (same number of hydrogens), then the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But I don't know if nH1 equals nH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute number of H, and just asks for the ratio of silicon relative to each star's H, which would make the ratio of Si (nSi1/nH1) over (nSi2/nH2 )=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But the question is the ratio of silicon atoms, which is (nSi1)/(nSi2 ), which could be different if the H abundance varies.

Wait, but without knowing the H ratio, how can we calculate the Si ratio? Unless the problem implies that the H ratio is 1, meaning same number of H in both stars.

But the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's re-express everything.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi1/nH1 =10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2= -0.3 → nSi2/nH2 =10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

So,

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

nSi2/nH2 =10^{-0.3} * (nSisun/nHsun )

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is ~4. So the answer would be approximately 4, which is option A.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which is (nSi1) / (nSi2).

But without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, I can't find (nSi1/nSi2 ) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 * nH2 )

Which is [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

So unless nH1/nH2 is 1, I can't proceed. But the problem doesn't give any data about the H content of the stars beyond what's implied by [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the two stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms, making nH1/nH2=1. If that's the case, then (nSi1/nSi2 )= (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ) )=10^{0.6}≈3.98, so the answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.

But I think the problem is structured such that the H ratio is 1, so the ratio of silicon is approximately 4. So I think the correct answer is A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1 × 10⁻⁵

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]
  Since \( n_{\text{H, Sun}} = 1 \), \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \).

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}}\right).
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \), we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]
  Since \( n_{\text{H, Sun}} = 1 \), \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \).

- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}\right).
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \), we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]
Assuming the hydrogen content is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Since \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon atoms is approximately **4.0**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
