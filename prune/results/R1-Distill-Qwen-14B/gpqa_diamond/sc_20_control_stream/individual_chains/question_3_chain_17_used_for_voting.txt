Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. The particle is in a specific superposition state, and I'm given the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the probabilities and the eigenvalues of the operator's components.

First, let me write down what I know. The state of the particle is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. I think |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which makes sense because σz is the Pauli z-matrix. So, σz|↑⟩ is |↑⟩ with eigenvalue 1, and σz|↓⟩ is |↓⟩ with eigenvalue -1, right?

The operator we're dealing with is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I can compute this by breaking it down into the two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Let me compute the expectation of σz first. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value for σz in this state should be manageable. Let me remember how to compute this. The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=√3/2. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2 * (1) + |b|^2 * (-1), because the eigenvalues are 1 and -1 for σz.

Calculating that: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |√3/2|^2 is (3/4) because (√3)^2 is 3, so (3/4)* (1/4) no wait, wait. Wait, (√3/2)^2 is (√3)^2 / (2^2) ) = 3/4. Oh right, so |a|^2 is 0.25 and |b|^2 is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now onto the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, I think they are |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So when you have a state in the σz basis, like this one, the expectation of σx would involve the probabilities in a different way.

Wait, how do I compute ⟨σx⟩ for this state? I remember that σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute it explicitly.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ψ† σx ψ, I take the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by σx, then multiply by ψ.

Let me compute that. ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and when I multiply by σx, which swaps the components. So ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Now multiplying by ψ:

= [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]
= (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) + (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)
= (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4)
= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254...

Wait, but wait. Are there any phases I'm missing? Because when you have σx, the expectation is a bit tricky because the state might not be an eigenstate. Alternatively, I think there's another way to compute ⟨σx⟩.

Alternatively, since σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the sum of the cross terms. Let's see:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5 ⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ) (|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| ) (0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ )

Let me expand this. Let me denote the coefficients as a=0.5 and b=√3/2. Then,

= a^* ⟨↑| + b^* ⟨↓| multiplied by σx, which gives a^* ⟨↑|σx and b^* ⟨↓|σx. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Alternatively, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So let me compute σx ψ:

σx ψ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (√3/2) σx |↓⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ | σx ψ⟩ is (0.5 ⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ) (0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ )

Multiplying term by term:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (√3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (√3/2)*(√3/2) * ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Now, ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1, same for ⟨↓|↓⟩.

So the terms are:

0.5 *0.5 *0 → 0,

0.5*(√3/2)*1 → (√3)/4,

(√3/2)*(0.5)*1 → same as above, (√3)/4,

(√3/2)*(√3/2)*0 → 0.

Adding them: (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. Then 5⟨σx⟩ would be 5*(√3/2) ≈ 4.330127.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a miscalculation there. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value for σx for a state that's a combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ can also be found using the formula ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re( a b^* ), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. Wait, I think that's correct because when you have a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(ab^*).

Wait, let's see: a is 0.5, b is √3/2. So ab^* is (0.5)(√3/2) * e^{i0} since both are real. So ab^* is (0.5)(√3/2) = √3/4. The real part is the same, so 2 Re(ab^*) is 2*(√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So that matches what I got earlier.

So, yes, ⟨σx⟩ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, so 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, but wait, 5 times √3/2 is (5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 → 8.66/2 ≈4.33. So that's correct.

Now, the total expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ → 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) → (-5) + (5√3/2).

Compute this: 5√3 is approximately 8.66, so 8.66/2 is about 4.33. So -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately. √3 is approximately 1.73205.

So 5√3 = 5 *1.73205 = 8.66025. Divided by 2 is 4.330125.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is -5. 5⟨σx⟩ is 4.330125.

So total is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer should be C) -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I can make sign errors.

Wait, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b=√3/2. So when computing ⟨σz⟩, it's |a|^2 - |b|^2 because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the expectation value is |a|²*(1) + |b|²*(-1) → 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Then ⟨σx⟩ is 2 Re(a b^*) → since a and b are real, it's 2*(a*b) → 2*(0.5*(√3/2)) → 2*(√3/4) = √3/2 ≈0.866. So 5*(0.866) is about 4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) are \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. For the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \) are \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|^2 = 0.75 \), respectively. Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

Multiplying by 10 gives:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.0
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). For a state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(ab^*)
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so:

\[
ab^* = (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are real, \( \text{Re}(ab^*) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \). Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

Multiplying by 5 gives:

\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5.0 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the result is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The operator we're dealing with is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I can compute this by breaking it down into the two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Let me compute the expectation of σz first. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value for σz in this state should be manageable. Let me remember how to compute this. The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=√3/2. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2 * (1) + |b|^2 * (-1), because the eigenvalues are 1 and -1 for σz.

Calculating that: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |√3/2|^2 is (3/4) because (√3)^2 is 3, so (3/4)* (1/4) no wait, wait. Wait, (√3/2)^2 is (√3)^2 / (2^2) ) = 3/4. Oh right, so |a|^2 is 0.25 and |b|^2 is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now onto the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, I think they are |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So when you have a state in the σz basis, like this one, the expectation of σx would involve the probabilities in a different way.

Wait, how do I compute ⟨σx⟩ for this state? I remember that σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute it explicitly.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ψ† σx ψ, I take the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by σx, then multiply by ψ.

Let me compute that. ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and when I multiply by σx, which swaps the components. So ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Now multiplying by ψ:

= [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]
= (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) + (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)
= (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4)
= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254...

Wait, but wait. Are there any phases I'm missing? Because when you have σx, the expectation is a bit tricky because the state might not be an eigenstate. Alternatively, I think there's another way to compute ⟨σx⟩.

Alternatively, since σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the sum of the cross terms. Let's see:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5 ⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ) (|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| ) (0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ )

Let me expand this. Let me denote the coefficients as a=0.5 and b=√3/2. Then,

= a^* ⟨↑| + b^* ⟨↓| multiplied by σx, which gives a^* ⟨↑|σx and b^* ⟨↓|σx. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Alternatively, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So let me compute σx ψ:

σx ψ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (√3/2) σx |↓⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ | σx ψ⟩ is (0.5 ⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ) (0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ )

Multiplying term by term:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (√3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (√3/2)*(√3/2) * ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Now, ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1, same for ⟨↓|↓⟩.

So the terms are:

0.5 *0.5 *0 → 0,

0.5*(√3/2)*1 → (√3)/4,

(√3/2)*(0.5)*1 → same as above, (√3)/4,

(√3/2)*(√3/2)*0 → 0.

Adding them: (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. Then 5⟨σx⟩ would be 5*(√3/2) ≈ 4.330127.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a miscalculation there. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value for σx for a state that's a combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ can also be found using the formula ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re( a b^* ), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. Wait, I think that's correct because when you have a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(ab^*).

Wait, let's see: a is 0.5, b is √3/2. So ab^* is (0.5)(√3/2) * e^{i0} since both are real. So ab^* is (0.5)(√3/2) = √3/4. The real part is the same, so 2 Re(ab^*) is 2*(√3/4) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So that matches what I got earlier.

So, yes, ⟨σx⟩ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, so 5⟨σx⟩ ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, but wait, 5 times √3/2 is (5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 → 8.66/2 ≈4.33. So that's correct.

Now, the total expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ → 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) → (-5) + (5√3/2).

Compute this: 5√3 is approximately 8.66, so 8.66/2 is about 4.33. So -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately. √3 is approximately 1.73205.

So 5√3 = 5 *1.73205 = 8.66025. Divided by 2 is 4.330125.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is -5. 5⟨σx⟩ is 4.330125.

So total is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer should be C) -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I can make sign errors.

Wait, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b=√3/2. So when computing ⟨σz⟩, it's |a|^2 - |b|^2 because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the expectation value is |a|²*(1) + |b|²*(-1) → 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Then ⟨σx⟩ is 2 Re(a b^*) → since a and b are real, it's 2*(a*b) → 2*(0.5*(√3/2)) → 2*(√3/4) = √3/2 ≈0.866. So 5*(0.866) is about 4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) are \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. For the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \) are \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|^2 = 0.75 \), respectively. Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

Multiplying by 10 gives:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.0
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). For a state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(ab^*)
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so:

\[
ab^* = (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are real, \( \text{Re}(ab^*) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \). Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

Multiplying by 5 gives:

\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5.0 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the result is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
