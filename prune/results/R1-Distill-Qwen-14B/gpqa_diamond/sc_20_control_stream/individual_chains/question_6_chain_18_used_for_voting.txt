Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential in two dimensions.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Hmm, wait, so it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in two dimensions, when the potential depends on r and θ, it's often useful to look for separation of variables or maybe use polar coordinates. Oh, and the particle's in a potential, so probably it's a problem that can be solved using the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates.

Wait, the potential looks like it has two terms. The first term is (1/2) k r², which reminds me of a harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Cos squared theta... Oh, that could be written using the double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe I can rewrite V(r,θ) as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me calculate each term. The first term is (1/2)k r². The second term is (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. So that becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So overall, the potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ).

Let me expand that. The first term is (1/2) k r², the second part is (3/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. So combining the terms without cos2θ:

(1/2 + 3/4) k r² = (5/4) k r². Then the other term is (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Hmm, maybe that's a better way to look at it. Or wait, perhaps it's better to factor out the r²: V(r,θ) = [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ] k r².

Wait, maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms. So the first part is (5/4)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator in r. Then there's another term involving cos2θ. Hmm, how does that affect the potential?

Wait, in two dimensions, when the potential has a term like cos2θ, that suggests that it depends on angular variables in a way that might allow for separation of variables in terms of certain functions, perhaps leading to angular momentum or some other quantum numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the equation into radial and angular parts. Let me think about the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates (r, θ). The time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

Since the potential depends on both r and θ, but perhaps we can separate the variables. Let me try to write ψ(r,θ) as R(r) Θ(θ). Then, the equation becomes:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r (d/dr)(r dR/dr) ) Θ + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) R Θ + (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² R ] = E R Θ.

Hmm, let's plug ψ = R Θ into the equation. So, grouping the terms, I get:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) R + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) R ] + [ (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] Θ = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by RΘ, I can separate variables:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) ] / R + [ ℏ²/(2m r²) (d²Θ/dθ²) ] / Θ = E.

Hmm, but because the equation has cos2θ, which depends on θ, and the other terms have r dependence, it's tricky to separate the variables because both terms depend on θ. Wait, perhaps I can find a way to make this work by considering that the angular part satisfies a certain equation.

Let me rearrange the equation:

[ (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) - (5/4 k r²) R ] / R + [ (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) R ] / Θ = E.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't the easiest. Maybe I can think of the potential as a sum of two parts: V(r,θ) = V1(r) + V2(r,θ), where V1 is the (5/4)k r² term, and V2 is the (3/4) k r² cos2θ term.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of angular momentum or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a function that can be broken down into a sum of terms that are functions of r and functions of θ.

Wait, another approach: In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a central potential (which depends only on r) is well-known, leading to radial and angular parts. But in this case, the potential depends on θ, so it's not central. So the problem isn't straightforward. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe this potential can be expressed in terms of a displacement of the central potential plus some perturbation. But perhaps it's better to consider the potential as a function that can be written in terms of the angular momentum operator.

Wait, the term with cos2θ can be expressed using angular momentum operators. Let me recall that the angular momentum operator in the z-direction is L_z = -iℏ ∂/∂θ. But that's for the operator. Alternatively, the Laplacian in spherical coordinates has terms involving L², which is L_x² + L_y² + L_z². But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the potential in terms of the spherical harmonics. Cos2θ is related to the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m}(θ,φ), but in 2D, it's a bit simpler.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operators. Let me think. The term involving cos2θ can be linked to the angular part of the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, considering the kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian: (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2). The p_θ term is (L_z)/(r), so p_θ^2 is (L_z)^2/(r^2). So the angular part of the kinetic energy is (L_z^2)/(2m r^2).

So putting all together, the total Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2) + V(r,θ).

Which is:

H = [ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) ] + [ - (ℏ²/(2m r^2)) d²/dθ² ] + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) 

Wait, perhaps I can group the terms in a way that can be separated. Let me see.

Hmm, perhaps I can rewrite the potential as:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² [ 1 + (3/5) cos2θ ]

Hmm, but not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the potential as a sum of a central part and a perturbation that depends on cos2θ. But I'm not sure if perturbation theory applies here, as the problem likely expects an exact solution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about possible forms of the potential. The first term is a harmonic oscillator in r. The second term is proportional to r² cos2θ, which suggests that the potential varies with θ in a way that could be expressed in terms of higher angular momentum states.

Wait, another approach: The potential can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operator. Let me recall that in two dimensions, the angular momentum is L = r × pθ, so L = r pθ, and the operator is L = -iℏ d/dθ. Therefore, L² = -ℏ² d²/dθ².

So the term involving cos2θ in the potential could be linked to the expectation value of some function of L. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of L.

Wait, cos2θ can be expressed using the spherical harmonics. In 2D, the spherical harmonics reduce to Y^m_l(θ), where l is integer, m = ±l. For l=2, m=0, cosθ is related to Y^0_1, but wait, cosθ is Y^0_1(θ, φ), but cos2θ would be something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to express cos2θ in terms of the angular momentum operators.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

Wait, another idea: Let me try to separate the variables. Let me assume that the wavefunction can be written as a product of a radial function R(r) and an angular function Θ(θ). Then, the Schrödinger equation becomes:

[ -(ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr)) + (5/4 k r²) R ] + [ -(ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ] = E R Θ.

Wait, but this doesn't separate because the terms involving R and Θ are coupled via the cos2θ term. So that approach might not work unless the cos2θ term is incorporated into one part or the other.

Hmm, maybe instead of assuming ψ = R(r) Θ(θ), perhaps I should consider the potential as a modified harmonic oscillator. Let me think: the first term is a harmonic oscillator in r. The second term introduces a dependence on cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part of the potential has a periodicity of 2π/2, so perhaps the angular wavefunctions are of the form e^{i 2θ}, which would correspond to an angular momentum number of 2.

Wait, that might be a clue. So in the angular part of the equation, if Θ(θ) is proportional to e^{i m θ}, then d²Θ/dθ² would be -m² Θ. So let's assume that Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer.

Then, the angular part of the equation becomes:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (-m²) Θ + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ] = E_angular part Θ.

Wait, but the potential term has cos2θ. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps cos2θ can be expressed in terms of exponentials. Cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2. So, when Θ is e^{i m θ}, then cos2θ would multiply Θ to give terms involving e^{i(m+2)θ} and e^{i(m-2)θ}.

Wait, but if m is fixed, this would require that the potential term only contributes when m is ±2. So perhaps the angular part of the solution has m=0 or m=±2? Maybe not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of terms involving different angular momenta. Let me think about this. The term (3/4)k r² cos2θ can be expressed as (3/8)k r² (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

So in the Schrödinger equation, when I include this term, it would mix different angular momentum states. But that complicates things because the potential is mixing m states.

Wait, but perhaps for certain m values, the potential term can be diagonal. For example, if m=0, then cos2θ is not diagonal in the basis of m=0, because it would mix m=+2 and m=-2 states. So perhaps the solution requires that the angular part aligns with the potential's angular dependence.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think back to the potential. The potential is V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. So the potential depends on cos2θ, which implies that the system has a preferred direction every π/2 radians. So perhaps the angular part of the solution must have m=0, 2, -2 or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a function that can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operator L². Let me think. L² is ℏ² (m^2 + m'^2?), wait, no. Wait, L² = -ℏ² d²/dθ² in 2D, so d²Θ/dθ² = - (L²/(ℏ²)) Θ.

Wait, perhaps I can express the potential in terms of L². For example, in the angular part:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = (E_angular) Θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express cos2θ in terms of L². Let me recall that in 3D, cosθ is proportional to Y10, but in 2D, perhaps it's similar.

Wait, another approach: Let me expand cos2θ as a function and see what operators it commutes with. Cos2θ is a function of θ, so it commutes with L_z (which is the angular momentum operator in the z-direction). Because L_z is -iℏ d/dθ, and cos2θ is a function, so [L_z, cos2θ] = 0.

Wait, that's a key point! If the potential term commutes with L_z, then it's possible to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the basis of L_z eigenstates. So perhaps we can write Θ(θ) as e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer, and the potential term can be expressed in terms of m.

So let's proceed with that. Let me write Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, so that L_z Θ = m ℏ Θ. Then, the angular part of the Schrödinger equation becomes:

[ -(ℏ²/(2m r²)) ( - m^2 ) Θ + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ] = E_angular Θ.

Hmm, but wait, the term 3/4 k r² cos2θ Θ is present. Let's compute that: cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ})/2. So cos2θ * Θ = [ e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ] / 2 * e^{i m θ} = [ e^{i(m+2)θ} + e^{i(m-2)θ} ] / 2.

So this introduces terms where m becomes m+2 and m-2. But for Θ to be an eigenstate, the potential term must not mix different m states. Wait, but in this case, the potential term is not diagonal in the m basis unless m is ±2. Hmm, perhaps the potential is diagonal only for specific m values. For example, if m=2, then cos2θ * Θ(θ) = [e^{i4θ} + e^{i0θ}]/2 * e^{i2θ} = [e^{i4θ} + 1] e^{i2θ}/2. Hmm, that doesn't seem to simplify into a single m value. Maybe this approach is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me consider an alternative approach. The potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten as:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

= (k r²) [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Hmm, perhaps this potential can be expressed as a sum of a central harmonic oscillator and a perturbation that depends on cos2θ. But again, I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Another thought: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operators. Let me think about the expectation value. If the particle's wavefunction is an eigenstate of L_z, that is, Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, then the expectation value of cos2θ would be:

⟨ cos2θ ⟩ = (1/2) ⟨ e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ⟩ = (1/2) [ e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ] e^{-i m θ} integrated over θ.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because ⟨ e^{i2θ} ⟩ for Θ= e^{i m θ} would be ∫0^{2π} e^{i2θ} e^{-i m θ} (1/(2π)) dθ = δ_{m,2}.

Similarly, ⟨ e^{-i2θ} ⟩ = δ_{m,-2}. So the expectation value ⟨ cos2θ ⟩ in this case would be (1/2)(δ_{m,2} + δ_{m,-2} ).

But I'm not sure if this helps me directly. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as proportional to (L_z)^2, since L_z = m ℏ, so (L_z)^2 = m² ℏ². But cos2θ isn't directly proportional to m². Hmm.

Wait, let me think about expanding the potential. The term (3/4)k r² cos2θ is proportional to r² cos2θ. So in terms of angular momentum, perhaps this term is related to the square of the angular momentum operator, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the Hamiltonian. The radial part is a harmonic oscillator, and the angular part has a term involving cos2θ.

If I can write the Hamiltonian as a sum of the radial part and the angular part, perhaps I can handle them separately. The radial part would be the usual harmonic oscillator, and the angular part would involve the cos2θ term.

Wait, let me try that. So the total Hamiltonian is:

H = H_radial + H_angular,

where H_radial includes the kinetic and potential terms in r, and H_angular includes the angular part involving cos2θ.

But is this possible? Let me write it out:

H_radial = [ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) ] + (5/4 k r²) R,

H_angular = [ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ].

But wait, this isn't accurate because the potential term is multiplied by r², which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out r² from the potential. Let me think: V(r,θ) = k r² [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ].

So the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = [ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) + (5/4 k r²) ] + [ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ ) ].

Hmm, but this still doesn't look separable because of the cos2θ term. Unless I can find a way to write the angular part in terms that can be diagonalized.

Wait, perhaps I can define a new angular variable or a new operator that combines the angular momentum and the potential. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution that allows me to write the angular part as a harmonic oscillator.

Wait, another thought: the angular part of the Hamiltonian (excluding the radial terms) is:

H_angular = - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Hmm, perhaps we can factor out r², but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the angular part can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operator. Let me express H_angular in terms of L_z.

We know that L_z = -iℏ d/dθ. So, L_z^2 = -ℏ² d²/dθ². So, d²/dθ² = - L_z^2 / ℏ².

Substituting into H_angular:

H_angular = - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) ( - L_z^2 / ℏ² ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ )

= (ℏ² L_z^2 )/(2m r²) ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ )

Hmm, but this still leaves the cos2θ term. Let me think about whether this can be expressed in terms of L_z. Since [L_z, cos2θ] = 0 (as L_z is the generator of rotations and cos2θ is a function of θ), the two terms in H_angular might commute. Thus, perhaps we can diagonalize H_angular in the basis of L_z eigenstates.

Wait, but cos2θ isn't an eigenoperator of L_z. Hmm, perhaps I can express cos2θ in terms of L_z. Wait, cos2θ is a function of θ, which is a variable in the wavefunction, so perhaps for a given m, cos2θ can be expressed in terms of m. For example, if the wavefunction is Θ_m(θ) = e^{i m θ}, then cos2θ = [e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}]/2. So when Θ_m is an eigenstate of L_z, then cos2θ Θ_m would couple m and m+2, m-2 states.

But that complicates things because it mixes different m states. So perhaps the potential term doesn't commute with L_z, which complicates diagonalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of cos2θ and L_z in such a way that the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of terms each of which is diagonal in some basis.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the possible energy levels.

The potential has two parts: a harmonic oscillator term in r and a term that depends on cos2θ. The harmonic oscillator in r would lead to quantized energy levels in the radial direction. The angular part, due to the cos2θ term, might lead to additional quantization from the angular part.

Suppose that in the radial direction, the energy is that of a harmonic oscillator. The radial part would contribute energy levels proportional to (n + 1/2)ℏω, where ω is sqrt(k/m), perhaps.

The angular part, due to the cos2θ term, might contribute additional energy levels. Let me think about the angular equation.

Assuming that the potential term is (3/4)k r² cos2θ, perhaps it can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operator. For example, if I express cos2θ in terms of L_z.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of terms involving L_z^2. Let me think, but I'm not sure.

Wait, cos2θ can be written as cos(2θ). Let me remember that in terms of angular momentum, cosθ is proportional to Y_10, and cos2θ would be a combination of higher spherical harmonics. But since the problem is in two dimensions, maybe I can express cos2θ in terms of L_z^2.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvalues. Suppose that the angular part of the Hamiltonian is:

H_angular = A L_z^2 + B cos2θ,

where A and B are constants. But I'm not sure about the form. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express cos2θ in terms of L_z.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the angular equation. Suppose I have the equation:

- (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = E_angular Θ.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the angular wavefunction. Let me try to write Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ} as before. Then, d²Θ/dθ² = -m² Θ.

Substituting into the equation:

- (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (-m² Θ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = E_angular Θ.

So,

(ℏ² m²)/(2m r²) Θ + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = E_angular Θ.

Simplify:

(ℏ² m²)/(2 r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) = E_angular.

But this doesn't seem helpful because cos2θ is a function of θ, and E_angular should be a constant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Because the equation is:

[ (ℏ² m²)/(2 r²) ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) ] Θ = E_angular Θ.

But for this equality to hold for all θ, the term in the brackets must be a constant, which it isn't. So perhaps this approach isn't viable.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the angular part of the potential as an oscillator in the angular direction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can rewrite the potential as a sum of a central term plus a perturbation. The first term is a harmonic oscillator in r, and the second term is a function that depends on both r and θ. But I'm not sure if this would allow for an exact solution.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a displacement operator or a shift in the angular coordinate. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be treated as an anisotropic oscillator, leading to different quantum numbers in different directions.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the form of the energy spectrum given in the options. All options are linear combinations of n_x and n_y, multiplied by ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Wait, but the problem is in two dimensions, but it's given in polar coordinates, so perhaps the quantum numbers are angular and radial. But wait, the options involve n_x and n_y, which are likely quantum numbers in Cartesian coordinates. So perhaps the original problem can be transformed into Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, the potential is given in polar coordinates, but perhaps it's easier to rewrite it in Cartesian coordinates. Let me try that. In 2D Cartesian coordinates, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So cosθ = x/(√(x² + y²)).

So, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

= (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y²)

Hmm, because cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). So substituting:

V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) * (x²)/(x² + y²)

= (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Simplify:

= (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x².

= (2k x² + k y²)/2.

Wait, wait, let me compute this step by step.

V = (1/2)k (x² + y^2) + (3/2)k (x^2 + y^2) * (x²)/(x² + y^2).

The second term simplifies to (3/2)k x². So:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

So, expanding the first term:

= (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x².

Combine like terms:

(1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² = (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, 1/2 +3/2 is 2, right. So V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, that's interesting! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators, but with different coefficients. The x-direction has a spring constant 4k (since 2k comes from (1/2) m ω², but I'll get to that in a moment), and the y-direction has a spring constant k.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express this. The potential in x is 2k x², which is (1/2) * (sqrt(8k))² x². Similarly, the potential in y is (1/2)k y², which is (1/2)(sqrt(k))² y².

So, in terms of quantum harmonic oscillators, the x-direction has ω_x = sqrt(8k/m), and the y-direction has ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So, in the x-direction, the potential is 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). And the y-direction has (1/2)k y^2 = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator (which is separable) would be the sum of the energies in each direction. The energy for each 1D oscillator is (n + 1/2) ℏ ω, where n is the principal quantum number (n = 0,1,2,...).

In the x-direction, the energy is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

In the y-direction, the energy is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E is the sum of the x and y energies:

E = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Combine the terms:

E = [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which matches option C, which says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking back at the options:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).

Which is exactly what I derived. So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To solve this, the potential is first rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \). Substituting these into the potential yields:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k(x^2 + y^2)\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
V(r, \theta) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \). The corresponding angular frequencies are:

\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{8k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator in each direction are given by:

\[
E_x = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x, \quad E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Combining terms:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in **Option C**. 

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential in two dimensions.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Hmm, wait, so it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in two dimensions, when the potential depends on r and θ, it's often useful to look for separation of variables or maybe use polar coordinates. Oh, and the particle's in a potential, so probably it's a problem that can be solved using the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates.

Wait, the potential looks like it has two terms. The first term is (1/2) k r², which reminds me of a harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Cos squared theta... Oh, that could be written using the double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe I can rewrite V(r,θ) as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me calculate each term. The first term is (1/2)k r². The second term is (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. So that becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So overall, the potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ).

Let me expand that. The first term is (1/2) k r², the second part is (3/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. So combining the terms without cos2θ:

(1/2 + 3/4) k r² = (5/4) k r². Then the other term is (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Hmm, maybe that's a better way to look at it. Or wait, perhaps it's better to factor out the r²: V(r,θ) = [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ] k r².

Wait, maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms. So the first part is (5/4)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator in r. Then there's another term involving cos2θ. Hmm, how does that affect the potential?

Wait, in two dimensions, when the potential has a term like cos2θ, that suggests that it depends on angular variables in a way that might allow for separation of variables in terms of certain functions, perhaps leading to angular momentum or some other quantum numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the equation into radial and angular parts. Let me think about the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates (r, θ). The time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

Since the potential depends on both r and θ, but perhaps we can separate the variables. Let me try to write ψ(r,θ) as R(r) Θ(θ). Then, the equation becomes:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r (d/dr)(r dR/dr) ) Θ + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) R Θ + (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² R ] = E R Θ.

Hmm, let's plug ψ = R Θ into the equation. So, grouping the terms, I get:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) R + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) R ] + [ (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] Θ = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by RΘ, I can separate variables:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) ] / R + [ ℏ²/(2m r²) (d²Θ/dθ²) ] / Θ = E.

Hmm, but because the equation has cos2θ, which depends on θ, and the other terms have r dependence, it's tricky to separate the variables because both terms depend on θ. Wait, perhaps I can find a way to make this work by considering that the angular part satisfies a certain equation.

Let me rearrange the equation:

[ (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) - (5/4 k r²) R ] / R + [ (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) R ] / Θ = E.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't the easiest. Maybe I can think of the potential as a sum of two parts: V(r,θ) = V1(r) + V2(r,θ), where V1 is the (5/4)k r² term, and V2 is the (3/4) k r² cos2θ term.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of angular momentum or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a function that can be broken down into a sum of terms that are functions of r and functions of θ.

Wait, another approach: In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a central potential (which depends only on r) is well-known, leading to radial and angular parts. But in this case, the potential depends on θ, so it's not central. So the problem isn't straightforward. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe this potential can be expressed in terms of a displacement of the central potential plus some perturbation. But perhaps it's better to consider the potential as a function that can be written in terms of the angular momentum operator.

Wait, the term with cos2θ can be expressed using angular momentum operators. Let me recall that the angular momentum operator in the z-direction is L_z = -iℏ ∂/∂θ. But that's for the operator. Alternatively, the Laplacian in spherical coordinates has terms involving L², which is L_x² + L_y² + L_z². But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the potential in terms of the spherical harmonics. Cos2θ is related to the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m}(θ,φ), but in 2D, it's a bit simpler.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operators. Let me think. The term involving cos2θ can be linked to the angular part of the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, considering the kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian: (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2). The p_θ term is (L_z)/(r), so p_θ^2 is (L_z)^2/(r^2). So the angular part of the kinetic energy is (L_z^2)/(2m r^2).

So putting all together, the total Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2) + V(r,θ).

Which is:

H = [ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) ] + [ - (ℏ²/(2m r^2)) d²/dθ² ] + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) 

Wait, perhaps I can group the terms in a way that can be separated. Let me see.

Hmm, perhaps I can rewrite the potential as:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² [ 1 + (3/5) cos2θ ]

Hmm, but not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the potential as a sum of a central part and a perturbation that depends on cos2θ. But I'm not sure if perturbation theory applies here, as the problem likely expects an exact solution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about possible forms of the potential. The first term is a harmonic oscillator in r. The second term is proportional to r² cos2θ, which suggests that the potential varies with θ in a way that could be expressed in terms of higher angular momentum states.

Wait, another approach: The potential can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operator. Let me recall that in two dimensions, the angular momentum is L = r × pθ, so L = r pθ, and the operator is L = -iℏ d/dθ. Therefore, L² = -ℏ² d²/dθ².

So the term involving cos2θ in the potential could be linked to the expectation value of some function of L. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of L.

Wait, cos2θ can be expressed using the spherical harmonics. In 2D, the spherical harmonics reduce to Y^m_l(θ), where l is integer, m = ±l. For l=2, m=0, cosθ is related to Y^0_1, but wait, cosθ is Y^0_1(θ, φ), but cos2θ would be something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to express cos2θ in terms of the angular momentum operators.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

Wait, another idea: Let me try to separate the variables. Let me assume that the wavefunction can be written as a product of a radial function R(r) and an angular function Θ(θ). Then, the Schrödinger equation becomes:

[ -(ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr)) + (5/4 k r²) R ] + [ -(ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ] = E R Θ.

Wait, but this doesn't separate because the terms involving R and Θ are coupled via the cos2θ term. So that approach might not work unless the cos2θ term is incorporated into one part or the other.

Hmm, maybe instead of assuming ψ = R(r) Θ(θ), perhaps I should consider the potential as a modified harmonic oscillator. Let me think: the first term is a harmonic oscillator in r. The second term introduces a dependence on cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part of the potential has a periodicity of 2π/2, so perhaps the angular wavefunctions are of the form e^{i 2θ}, which would correspond to an angular momentum number of 2.

Wait, that might be a clue. So in the angular part of the equation, if Θ(θ) is proportional to e^{i m θ}, then d²Θ/dθ² would be -m² Θ. So let's assume that Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer.

Then, the angular part of the equation becomes:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (-m²) Θ + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ] = E_angular part Θ.

Wait, but the potential term has cos2θ. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps cos2θ can be expressed in terms of exponentials. Cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2. So, when Θ is e^{i m θ}, then cos2θ would multiply Θ to give terms involving e^{i(m+2)θ} and e^{i(m-2)θ}.

Wait, but if m is fixed, this would require that the potential term only contributes when m is ±2. So perhaps the angular part of the solution has m=0 or m=±2? Maybe not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of terms involving different angular momenta. Let me think about this. The term (3/4)k r² cos2θ can be expressed as (3/8)k r² (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

So in the Schrödinger equation, when I include this term, it would mix different angular momentum states. But that complicates things because the potential is mixing m states.

Wait, but perhaps for certain m values, the potential term can be diagonal. For example, if m=0, then cos2θ is not diagonal in the basis of m=0, because it would mix m=+2 and m=-2 states. So perhaps the solution requires that the angular part aligns with the potential's angular dependence.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think back to the potential. The potential is V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. So the potential depends on cos2θ, which implies that the system has a preferred direction every π/2 radians. So perhaps the angular part of the solution must have m=0, 2, -2 or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a function that can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operator L². Let me think. L² is ℏ² (m^2 + m'^2?), wait, no. Wait, L² = -ℏ² d²/dθ² in 2D, so d²Θ/dθ² = - (L²/(ℏ²)) Θ.

Wait, perhaps I can express the potential in terms of L². For example, in the angular part:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = (E_angular) Θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express cos2θ in terms of L². Let me recall that in 3D, cosθ is proportional to Y10, but in 2D, perhaps it's similar.

Wait, another approach: Let me expand cos2θ as a function and see what operators it commutes with. Cos2θ is a function of θ, so it commutes with L_z (which is the angular momentum operator in the z-direction). Because L_z is -iℏ d/dθ, and cos2θ is a function, so [L_z, cos2θ] = 0.

Wait, that's a key point! If the potential term commutes with L_z, then it's possible to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the basis of L_z eigenstates. So perhaps we can write Θ(θ) as e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer, and the potential term can be expressed in terms of m.

So let's proceed with that. Let me write Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, so that L_z Θ = m ℏ Θ. Then, the angular part of the Schrödinger equation becomes:

[ -(ℏ²/(2m r²)) ( - m^2 ) Θ + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ] = E_angular Θ.

Hmm, but wait, the term 3/4 k r² cos2θ Θ is present. Let's compute that: cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ})/2. So cos2θ * Θ = [ e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ] / 2 * e^{i m θ} = [ e^{i(m+2)θ} + e^{i(m-2)θ} ] / 2.

So this introduces terms where m becomes m+2 and m-2. But for Θ to be an eigenstate, the potential term must not mix different m states. Wait, but in this case, the potential term is not diagonal in the m basis unless m is ±2. Hmm, perhaps the potential is diagonal only for specific m values. For example, if m=2, then cos2θ * Θ(θ) = [e^{i4θ} + e^{i0θ}]/2 * e^{i2θ} = [e^{i4θ} + 1] e^{i2θ}/2. Hmm, that doesn't seem to simplify into a single m value. Maybe this approach is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me consider an alternative approach. The potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten as:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

= (k r²) [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Hmm, perhaps this potential can be expressed as a sum of a central harmonic oscillator and a perturbation that depends on cos2θ. But again, I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Another thought: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operators. Let me think about the expectation value. If the particle's wavefunction is an eigenstate of L_z, that is, Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ}, then the expectation value of cos2θ would be:

⟨ cos2θ ⟩ = (1/2) ⟨ e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ⟩ = (1/2) [ e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ] e^{-i m θ} integrated over θ.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because ⟨ e^{i2θ} ⟩ for Θ= e^{i m θ} would be ∫0^{2π} e^{i2θ} e^{-i m θ} (1/(2π)) dθ = δ_{m,2}.

Similarly, ⟨ e^{-i2θ} ⟩ = δ_{m,-2}. So the expectation value ⟨ cos2θ ⟩ in this case would be (1/2)(δ_{m,2} + δ_{m,-2} ).

But I'm not sure if this helps me directly. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as proportional to (L_z)^2, since L_z = m ℏ, so (L_z)^2 = m² ℏ². But cos2θ isn't directly proportional to m². Hmm.

Wait, let me think about expanding the potential. The term (3/4)k r² cos2θ is proportional to r² cos2θ. So in terms of angular momentum, perhaps this term is related to the square of the angular momentum operator, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the Hamiltonian. The radial part is a harmonic oscillator, and the angular part has a term involving cos2θ.

If I can write the Hamiltonian as a sum of the radial part and the angular part, perhaps I can handle them separately. The radial part would be the usual harmonic oscillator, and the angular part would involve the cos2θ term.

Wait, let me try that. So the total Hamiltonian is:

H = H_radial + H_angular,

where H_radial includes the kinetic and potential terms in r, and H_angular includes the angular part involving cos2θ.

But is this possible? Let me write it out:

H_radial = [ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) ] + (5/4 k r²) R,

H_angular = [ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ ].

But wait, this isn't accurate because the potential term is multiplied by r², which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out r² from the potential. Let me think: V(r,θ) = k r² [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ].

So the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = [ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) + (5/4 k r²) ] + [ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ ) ].

Hmm, but this still doesn't look separable because of the cos2θ term. Unless I can find a way to write the angular part in terms that can be diagonalized.

Wait, perhaps I can define a new angular variable or a new operator that combines the angular momentum and the potential. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution that allows me to write the angular part as a harmonic oscillator.

Wait, another thought: the angular part of the Hamiltonian (excluding the radial terms) is:

H_angular = - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Hmm, perhaps we can factor out r², but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the angular part can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operator. Let me express H_angular in terms of L_z.

We know that L_z = -iℏ d/dθ. So, L_z^2 = -ℏ² d²/dθ². So, d²/dθ² = - L_z^2 / ℏ².

Substituting into H_angular:

H_angular = - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) ( - L_z^2 / ℏ² ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ )

= (ℏ² L_z^2 )/(2m r²) ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ )

Hmm, but this still leaves the cos2θ term. Let me think about whether this can be expressed in terms of L_z. Since [L_z, cos2θ] = 0 (as L_z is the generator of rotations and cos2θ is a function of θ), the two terms in H_angular might commute. Thus, perhaps we can diagonalize H_angular in the basis of L_z eigenstates.

Wait, but cos2θ isn't an eigenoperator of L_z. Hmm, perhaps I can express cos2θ in terms of L_z. Wait, cos2θ is a function of θ, which is a variable in the wavefunction, so perhaps for a given m, cos2θ can be expressed in terms of m. For example, if the wavefunction is Θ_m(θ) = e^{i m θ}, then cos2θ = [e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}]/2. So when Θ_m is an eigenstate of L_z, then cos2θ Θ_m would couple m and m+2, m-2 states.

But that complicates things because it mixes different m states. So perhaps the potential term doesn't commute with L_z, which complicates diagonalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of cos2θ and L_z in such a way that the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of terms each of which is diagonal in some basis.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the possible energy levels.

The potential has two parts: a harmonic oscillator term in r and a term that depends on cos2θ. The harmonic oscillator in r would lead to quantized energy levels in the radial direction. The angular part, due to the cos2θ term, might lead to additional quantization from the angular part.

Suppose that in the radial direction, the energy is that of a harmonic oscillator. The radial part would contribute energy levels proportional to (n + 1/2)ℏω, where ω is sqrt(k/m), perhaps.

The angular part, due to the cos2θ term, might contribute additional energy levels. Let me think about the angular equation.

Assuming that the potential term is (3/4)k r² cos2θ, perhaps it can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operator. For example, if I express cos2θ in terms of L_z.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of terms involving L_z^2. Let me think, but I'm not sure.

Wait, cos2θ can be written as cos(2θ). Let me remember that in terms of angular momentum, cosθ is proportional to Y_10, and cos2θ would be a combination of higher spherical harmonics. But since the problem is in two dimensions, maybe I can express cos2θ in terms of L_z^2.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvalues. Suppose that the angular part of the Hamiltonian is:

H_angular = A L_z^2 + B cos2θ,

where A and B are constants. But I'm not sure about the form. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express cos2θ in terms of L_z.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the angular equation. Suppose I have the equation:

- (ℏ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = E_angular Θ.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the angular wavefunction. Let me try to write Θ(θ) = e^{i m θ} as before. Then, d²Θ/dθ² = -m² Θ.

Substituting into the equation:

- (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (-m² Θ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = E_angular Θ.

So,

(ℏ² m²)/(2m r²) Θ + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) Θ = E_angular Θ.

Simplify:

(ℏ² m²)/(2 r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) = E_angular.

But this doesn't seem helpful because cos2θ is a function of θ, and E_angular should be a constant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Because the equation is:

[ (ℏ² m²)/(2 r²) ) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) ] Θ = E_angular Θ.

But for this equality to hold for all θ, the term in the brackets must be a constant, which it isn't. So perhaps this approach isn't viable.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the angular part of the potential as an oscillator in the angular direction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can rewrite the potential as a sum of a central term plus a perturbation. The first term is a harmonic oscillator in r, and the second term is a function that depends on both r and θ. But I'm not sure if this would allow for an exact solution.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a displacement operator or a shift in the angular coordinate. Alternatively, perhaps the angular part can be treated as an anisotropic oscillator, leading to different quantum numbers in different directions.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the form of the energy spectrum given in the options. All options are linear combinations of n_x and n_y, multiplied by ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Wait, but the problem is in two dimensions, but it's given in polar coordinates, so perhaps the quantum numbers are angular and radial. But wait, the options involve n_x and n_y, which are likely quantum numbers in Cartesian coordinates. So perhaps the original problem can be transformed into Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, the potential is given in polar coordinates, but perhaps it's easier to rewrite it in Cartesian coordinates. Let me try that. In 2D Cartesian coordinates, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So cosθ = x/(√(x² + y²)).

So, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

= (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²)/(x² + y²)

Hmm, because cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). So substituting:

V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) * (x²)/(x² + y²)

= (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Simplify:

= (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x².

= (2k x² + k y²)/2.

Wait, wait, let me compute this step by step.

V = (1/2)k (x² + y^2) + (3/2)k (x^2 + y^2) * (x²)/(x² + y^2).

The second term simplifies to (3/2)k x². So:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

So, expanding the first term:

= (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x².

Combine like terms:

(1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² = (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, 1/2 +3/2 is 2, right. So V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, that's interesting! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators, but with different coefficients. The x-direction has a spring constant 4k (since 2k comes from (1/2) m ω², but I'll get to that in a moment), and the y-direction has a spring constant k.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express this. The potential in x is 2k x², which is (1/2) * (sqrt(8k))² x². Similarly, the potential in y is (1/2)k y², which is (1/2)(sqrt(k))² y².

So, in terms of quantum harmonic oscillators, the x-direction has ω_x = sqrt(8k/m), and the y-direction has ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So, in the x-direction, the potential is 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). And the y-direction has (1/2)k y^2 = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator (which is separable) would be the sum of the energies in each direction. The energy for each 1D oscillator is (n + 1/2) ℏ ω, where n is the principal quantum number (n = 0,1,2,...).

In the x-direction, the energy is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

In the y-direction, the energy is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E is the sum of the x and y energies:

E = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Combine the terms:

E = [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which matches option C, which says E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking back at the options:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).

Which is exactly what I derived. So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To solve this, the potential is first rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \). Substituting these into the potential yields:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k(x^2 + y^2)\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
V(r, \theta) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This shows that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \). The corresponding angular frequencies are:

\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{8k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator in each direction are given by:

\[
E_x = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x, \quad E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Combining terms:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in **Option C**.
