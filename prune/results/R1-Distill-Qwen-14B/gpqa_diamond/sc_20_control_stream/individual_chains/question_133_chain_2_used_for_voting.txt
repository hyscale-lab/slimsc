Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium phosphate dihydrate. Wait, no, wait. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules attached. So, yeah, those are the two components.

The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. Hmm, I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, HPO4^3- or PO4^3-.

The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so that shouldn't complicate things. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. These are Ka1, Ka2, Ka3, right? So H3PO4 loses protons in three steps.

Wait, I should remember the dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So each step deprotonates the phosphate by one H+.

Now, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O). Or wait, Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which in solution would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. Wait, but how do these ions interact? Maybe they can form a buffer solution.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form. So if any of the HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- deprotonate further, that would form PO4^3-.

But wait, in solution, the HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-, but that's a very weak acid (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small). So the extent of deprotonation from HPO4^2- to PO4^3- would be minimal.

Similarly, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but that's a larger Ka. So in this solution, perhaps both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, and the PO4^3- is minimal.

Wait, but perhaps the phosphate species are in equilibrium. So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Wait, but the given data is the amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about PO4^3- concentration. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.

So perhaps the PO4^3- concentration arises from the HPO4^2- in solution. Let me think: the HPO4^2- ion can act as an acid (losing a proton) or as a base (gaining a proton). But in this case, since we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, what is the pH?

Wait, but the problem doesn't give a pH. So perhaps I need to calculate the pH first based on the buffer solution created by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me consider that. So, first, I'll calculate the moles of each phosphate species.

Calculating moles:

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Mw = 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let me compute that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007337 mol. Wait, more precisely, 136.09 is about 136.1, so 1/136.1 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

So the solution has 0.007337 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005607 mol of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M ≈ 3.6685e-2 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028035 M ≈ 2.8035e-2 M

Now, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, they form a buffer. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

But wait, which Ka are we using here? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- or accept a proton to become H3PO4. But in this case, the relevant equilibrium is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base). So the Ka here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Wait a second, no. Wait, Ka2 is for H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-. So in the Henderson equation, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So pKa2 = log(6.2e-8)^-1. Let me compute that.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log( (0.028035) / (0.036685) )

Wait, the base is [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035, acid [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685.

So the ratio is 0.028035 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.7647.

log(0.7647) is approximately -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.

So the pH is around 7.09.

Now, considering the phosphate species. The HPO4^2- can deprotonate further into PO4^3- via the reaction:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The equilibrium for this is governed by Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So at the solution's pH, which is around 7.09, what's the concentration of PO4^3-?

We can set up the equilibrium expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [H+] is 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.12e-8.

Wait, [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So rearranging the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M

[H+] = 8.12e-8

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.12e-8.

Let me compute that.

First, 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 ≈ 5.0463e-14.

Then, dividing by 8.12e-8:

5.0463e-14 / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.21e-7.

Wait, that's 6.21e-7 M. So the concentration is approximately 6.21e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

Wait, but did I make any miscalculations? Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial moles:

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol → correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol → correct.

Concentrations are 0.036685 M and 0.028035 M → correct.

pH calculation: pKa2 is ~7.207, log(0.7647) is log(0.7647). Let me compute that more accurately.

Log(0.7647): log(7.647e-1) → log(7.647)=0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116. So pH=7.207 -0.116=7.091.

[H+] = 1e-7.091 ≈ 8.08e-8 (since 10^-7.09 is about 8.07e-8). So closer to 8.08e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.08e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8: 5.0463e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.08 ) * 1e-6.

5.0463 /8.08 ≈ 0.6245 → 0.6245e-6 = 6.245e-7.

So approximately 6.245e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.

Wait, but wait a moment. Are the contributions from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- considered? Because HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3-, but H2PO4^- can also deprotonate to HPO4^2-, which can then deprotonate further. But in this case, since we have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the HPO4^2- is the one that can lose a proton to become PO4^3-, which is our target.

Wait, but the H2PO4^- is at a higher concentration and a lower pH region, so it's more likely to lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is already present. But for the PO4^3- concentration, maybe it's only from the HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the initial approach was correct. So the calculation gives approximately 6.24e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, so that's the answer.

But wait, another thought: when considering the buffer system, the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- via Ka2. So the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- affects the pH. But the PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton, and that's governed by Ka3.

So the initial approach was correct. So the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibria involving phosphate species.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each phosphate species
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molecular weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Dissociates into \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molecular weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Dissociates into \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of phosphate species
The total volume of the solution is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.200 \, \text{L} \).  
- \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007337 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M} \).  
- \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005607 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution contains \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \), forming a buffer. The relevant equilibrium is:  
\[
\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \quad \text{(Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}).
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right).
\]  
- \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \).  
- \( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.028035}{0.036685} \approx 0.7647 \).  
- \( \log(0.7647) \approx -0.114 \).  

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.
\]  

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \)
The \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) ion can deprotonate to form \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \):  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-} \quad \text{(Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}).
\]  
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}.
\]  
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]  
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
- Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028035)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]  
- Numerator: \( (1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028035) \approx 5.0463 \times 10^{-14} \).  
- Denominator: \( 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \).  
- \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0463 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option **A**.
