Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I'll need to figure out each step, the products formed, and then determine how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. Structure-wise, that's a six-membered cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (a carbonyl) attached. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an O double-bonded to a carbon that's attached to two more CH2 groups or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Cyclohexanone is cyclohexane with a ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group (C=O). So the structure is a chair conformation where the carbonyl is in a fixed position.

Step 1: Treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Hmm, what does that do? I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions. Wait, bromine is Br2, and in what solvent? Well, I think when ketones are treated with bromine, especially in a non-polar solvent, it might undergo a bromination via a certain mechanism. Oh wait, another possibility: the cyclohexanone has an alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) that can undergo addition reactions. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? Or perhaps it's an addition across the carbonyl, but wait, ketones don't usually add bromine like alkenes do. Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone might not react with bromine under normal conditions. Wait, another thought: perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that requires dienes. Wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, oh wait, there's another possibility. The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, and when treated with bromine, perhaps it undergoes a bromination via the enol mechanism. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another reaction comes to mind: the ketone can undergo an aldol addition, but that's with another ketone or aldehyde. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, another possibility: perhaps the ketone is undergoing a cyclohexenone formation. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, I think the correct reaction here is that the ketone undergoes a bromination at the alpha position. So the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are sites for bromine addition. So cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha carbons (since it's a ring), each with two H's. So when treated with bromine, maybe it adds a bromine across the double bond if it's conjugated. Wait, no, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing a ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. Another possibility is that the ketone forms an enol, which can then react with bromine. The enol has a double bond between the alpha carbons. So bromine could add across that. So when the enol attacks Br2, it could add across the double bond, leading to dibromide. Wait, but wait, the enol is more reactive. So when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, which is a dienophile perhaps? Or maybe it's an addition to the enol.

Wait, I think the correct product is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. But wait, let me clarify. The starting material is cyclohexanone. When treated with bromine, perhaps it's undergoing a halogenation at the alpha positions. So the reaction could be the addition of Br to the alpha carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed process where the enol forms, and then Br adds.

Wait, another approach: maybe the first step is a bromination of the cyclohexanone via the alpha position. So the product 1 would have a bromine added to the alpha carbon. Since the starting material is a ketone, the alpha positions are the carbons next to the carbonyl. In cyclohexanone, each of those has two hydrogens. So the bromine could add to one or both of those positions.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, no, that's when you have an epoxide opening, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-addition? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the cyclohexanone is treated with a solution of bromine in a solvent like dichloromethane. In such cases, the ketone's alpha carbons can undergo bromination via a radical mechanism or an ionic mechanism.

Wait, no, another possibility: I'm confusing this with the benzaldehyde bromination. Benzaldehyde can undergo bromination at the alpha position using a brominating agent like Br2 in a basic solution, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination via the enol mechanism. The ketone forms an enol, which is more reactive towards electrophiles. Then, Br2 could add to the double bond of the enol, leading to the formation of a 1,2-dibromide.

Wait, so cyclohexanone's enol would be a cyclohexene with the oxygen as part of the conjugated system. Then, adding Br2 would add across the double bond, leading to 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. So product 1 would have two bromine atoms added to the two adjacent alpha carbons.

Wait, but let me think again. When you add bromine to an enol, you would get a 1,2-dibromide. So the product would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the ring. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but perhaps the first step is a bromination at the alpha position without the enol. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more like a substitution, but that doesn't make much sense because the alpha carbons are not particularly nucleophilic.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromide via the mechanism where the carbonyl oxygen acts as a base, abstracting a proton from the alpha carbon to form an enolate, which then attacks Br2. So the enolate would have negative charge on the alpha carbon, which would attack Br2, leading to the addition of Br.

Wait, so the enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon, and then Br2 would add across. So product 1 would have two bromines added on adjacent carbons, making it a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Okay, moving on. Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2.

Hmm, sodium hydroxide is a strong base. So what could happen when 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone is treated with NaOH? Well, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two adjacent bromine atoms, perhaps they can eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, yes, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone, then when heated with a base like NaOH, it would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a double bond. So the two Br atoms would leave, and two H's would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons where the Br atoms were.

So product 2 would be cyclohexene with a ketone. Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone has a ring, so if the double bond forms between two adjacent carbons, that would give cyclohexenone. So product 2 is cyclohexenone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone group and a double bond.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the structure. The starting product after the first step is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. So the structure would have the ketone at a certain position, and two adjacent Br atoms on the next two carbons. So when eliminating, the two Brs would leave, but that would form a double bond between those two carbons.

So product 2 would be cyclohexenone, which is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. So the ring has a carbonyl and a double bond adjacent to it.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3.

Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone. Wait, when a ketone is treated with thionyl chloride, it usually converts the ketone into an acyl chloride. So, cyclohexenone (the ketone) would react with SOCl2 to form cyclohexenyl chloride? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the ketone (R-CO-R') becomes R-COCl. So if product 2 is cyclohexenone (structure is cyclohexene with a ketone), then treating with SOCl2 would replace the ketone oxygen with a Cl, so product 3 would be cyclohexenyl chloride, specifically, cyclohexenyl chloroketone? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if it's cyclohexenone, the structure is:

O
||
C-Ring (with a double bond)

So when treated with SOCl2, the ketone group (O) becomes Cl. So product 3 would be cyclohexenyl chloride, but wait, where is the Cl attached? Let me think. The ketone is at one position, so after reaction with SOCl2, the carbonyl becomes a Cl. So the structure becomes Cl-C with a double bond in the ring. So product 3 is cyclohexenyl chloride, where the carbonyl has been replaced by Cl. Wait, but wait, no, that's not right. So cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone. After step 1, it's 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Step 2 gives cyclohexenone. Step 3 is treating cyclohexenone with SOCl2. So the ketone (O) becomes Cl. So product 3 is cyclohexenyl chloride, where the carbonyl is now a Cl. So structure-wise, it's a cyclohexene ring with a Cl attached to a carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: when cyclohexenone (the ketone) is treated with SOCl2, it forms cyclohexenyl chloride, but wait, no, the ketone is converted to an acyl chloride. Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone. When you treat it with SOCl2, you get cyclohexyl chloride, but more accurately, the ketone becomes an acyl chloride. So structure would be Cl-C=O, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. No, when a ketone is treated with SOCl2, it's converted to an acyl chloride. So for cyclohexanone, the product would be cyclohexyl chloroketone? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Ah, no, the correct reaction is that the ketone (R-CO-R') reacts with SOCl2 to form R-COCl and HCl and SO2. So, for cyclohexanone, it would form cyclohexyl chloride, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the ketone group (C=O) becomes a C=Cl. So the product is cyclohexyl chloroketone? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps the correct product is cyclohexyl chloride, but I'm getting confused now.

Wait, maybe I should just think of the product as cyclohexenyl chloride. No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to write it.

Cyclohexenone is:

O
||
C-Ring (with a double bond)

When treated with SOCl2, the ketone group (O) becomes Cl, so it becomes:

Cl
|
C-Ring (with a double bond)

Wait, no, that's a chlorinated carbon, but the structure would be Cl-C=CH2 in the ring. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. So, cyclohexenone is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. When treated with SOCl2, the ketone O is replaced by Cl. So the product would be a chlorinated cyclohexene, but where? The ketone was at position 1, so after reaction, the Cl would be at position 1, and the double bond is between positions 1 and 2? Wait, no, the double bond in cyclohexenone is between C1 and C2, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ketone is at C1. So after treatment with SOCl2, the C1 becomes Cl. So the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with Cl at C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would make the structure a chlorinated compound with a double bond adjacent to the Cl. Hmm, that might form an allyl chloride.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent this as a cyclohexene ring where the carbonyl has been replaced by Cl. So product 3 is Cl-C=CH2 in the ring. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, but perhaps the correct structure is that the ketone is converted into a Cl, so the carbonyl becomes a Cl, and the adjacent double bond remains. So product 3 is a chlorinated cyclohexene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction of the ketone with SOCl2 doesn't change the double bond. So if product 2 is cyclohexenone, which has a double bond between C1 and C2, for example, and a ketone at C1. Then, treating with SOCl2 would convert the ketone into Cl, so the structure would be Cl attached to C1, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule would have a Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but then the structure would be a cyclohexene with a Cl on C1, adjacent to the double bond. So product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

Moving on to step 4: Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), forming product 4.

LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, but it's also a selective one. I remember that it's a bulky reducing agent and tends to effect hydride reductions in a less hindered environment.

Looking at product 3: if it's 1-chlorocyclohexene, then when treated with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH(t-Bu)3, what would happen? Well, 1-chlorocyclohexene is a chlorinated alkene.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps product 3 is a ketone again, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, product 2 was cyclohexenone (a ketone), product 3 is the result of treating it with SOCl2, which converts the ketone into Cl. So product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

So, when treating 1-chlorocyclohexene with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, what happens? Well, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce alkenes, but under certain conditions. Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the Cl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Cl is a leaving group. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is present, maybe it acts as a base and induces elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the chlorinated alkene would undergo a reduction. Wait, but LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is primarily a reducing agent, but maybe it can also perform other reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the reducing agent provides H- which could lead to some kind of attack.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Cl is at a position adjacent to a double bond. Let's imagine the structure is Cl attached to C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C1=C2-CH2-... etc. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps the H- would attack the double bond in a conjugate addition.

But wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups, but in this case, perhaps it's acting on the alkene.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the reducing agent provides a hydride which attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydride would add to the double bond, but considering the structure, it's more likely that the hydride would attack the less substituted end due to the bulky nature of the reducing agent (steric effects). So, in a less substituted position, the hydride would add to the less hindered carbon.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think step by step.

Product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the double bond. But wait, LiAlH is generally used to reduce carbonyl groups, not alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl leaves, and the hydride adds to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another approach: the structure of product 3 is Cl attached to C1, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, H- would attack the double bond. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by a hydride, but that would form an alkane.

Wait, if the Cl leaves (as a Cl-), and the H- attacks C1, then what happens? The structure would become CH2Cl, but wait, no, because the Cl would leave, and the hydride would add. Hmm, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where Cl is replaced by H. So product 4 would be cyclohexane with H added where the Cl was.

Wait, but wait, the structure of product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps it performs a substitution, replacing Cl with H. That would give cyclohexene with H in place of Cl. But then, what happens to the double bond? Perhaps the H adds to the double bond, reducing it.

Wait, so maybe product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with an additional H where the Cl was.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is reduced, leading to cyclohexane.

Wait, but LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, so perhaps it would reduce the double bond. So in that case, the double bond in the cyclohexene would be hydrogenated, leading to cyclohexane with a Cl in the ring.

Wait, but LiAlH is more often used for carbonyl reductions, not so much for alkene reductions. So perhaps the main reaction is the substitution of Cl with H.

Wait, so product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, and a good source of H-, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H. So product 4 would be cyclohexene with H in place of Cl. But wait, that would form cyclohexene with CH2 groups. But wait, no, the substitution would lead to a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1-chlorocyclohexene has Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps it's a hydride reduction that adds H- to the double bond. So the double bond would be hydrogenated, turning into a single bond. But since LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it would add H to both ends of the double bond, leading to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on this step. Let me think about the possible product.

If product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene, and product 4 is made by treating it with a strong reducing agent, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated. So product 4 would be cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl was. Wait, but that would mean the ring is saturated and the Cl is replaced by H.

Wait, but if the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, then product 4 would be cyclohexane with all single bonds and a CH2 group where the Cl was. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring, perhaps with a CH2 group attached where the Cl was.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is only performing a substitution, not a reduction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the hydride acts as a nucleophile, replacing Cl. So product 4 would be cyclohexene with H added where the Cl was, but that doesn't make sense because substitution would require a single bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of some sort.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the Cl leaving, and the hydride adding to the adjacent carbon. So the double bond would shift or change, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is eliminated, and the hydride adds to the double bond. So the product would have an additional H from the hydride.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 4 as cyclohexane, with two H's added where the Cl was and the double bond.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to summarize:

- Product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

- Product 4 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3.

- LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, so perhaps it reduces the double bond, adding H's. But since it's a bulky agent, perhaps it adds in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration, but LiAlH isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, leading to cyclohexane with a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cyclohexane with a methyl group. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond remains, but that doesn't make sense as a reduction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.

So, product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, a strong reducing agent, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated.

So product 4 would be cyclohexane, with a CH2 group where the Cl was.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have six CH2 groups, making it cyclohexane, which would have all H's equivalent, but that's not the case. Or wait, no, because the substitution might create some symmetry.

Wait, but if the Cl was at a position that, when replaced, makes the molecule symmetric, then the number of distinct H's would be fewer.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexane with a CH2Cl group, but no, the Cl is replaced by H.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane, with a CH2 group where the Cl was, but the ring is now fully hydrogenated. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the ring is already six-membered. So perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2 group at a certain position.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Maybe the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, leading to a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl was. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group on one carbon.

Wait, but that would mean the molecule has two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is cyclohexane without any substituents because the Cl is replaced by H and the double bond is hydrogenated. But that would make product 4 cyclohexane, which has all equivalent H's in the ring, but wait, no, cyclohexane's H's are not all equivalent. In fact, cyclohexane has H's in different positions, but all H's on a given carbon are equivalent.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a symmetric molecule, so perhaps all H's are equivalent, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, no, in chair conformations, axial and equatorial H's are different, but in terms of chemical equivalence, all H's on the same carbon are equivalent, but different carbons have different H's.

Wait, but if product 4 is cyclohexane, then how many distinct H's would it have? Well, cyclohexane has two types of H's: axial and equatorial, but in reality, they are not chemically equivalent. Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane, the H's on each carbon are equivalent, but each carbon's H's are a different set.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of cyclohexane: each carbon has two H's, and each set of equivalent H's is on the same carbon. So, for a cyclohexane ring, the number of chemically distinct H's would depend on the symmetry.

Wait, for cyclohexane, which is a chair conformation, each carbon's H's are equivalent, but the axial and equatorial positions are different. But in terms of chemical equivalence under normal circumstances, the H's on each carbon are equivalent, but the H's on adjacent carbons are not.

Wait, but in reality, all the H's in cyclohexane are not all equivalent. For example, in a chair conformation, each axial H is equivalent to others in that position, but equatorial H's are different. So the number of distinct H's in cyclohexane is 2: axial and equatorial. But wait, that's not correct because each carbon has two H's, but in the ring, each carbon's H's are in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. If product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with all CH2 groups, then each CH2 has two H's that are equivalent. But in a cyclohexane ring, each CH2 group is equivalent to others only if the molecule has symmetry.

Wait, but if product 4 is a cyclohexane with all CH2 groups and no substituents, then each carbon's H's are equivalent within their own carbon. So, for a cyclohexane ring, each carbon has two H's, and each of these sets is equivalent within the ring. So the number of distinct H's would be six, because each of the six carbons has a unique set of H's.

No, wait: in cyclohexane, each pair of H's on a carbon are equivalent, but each carbon's H's are not equivalent to the next. So in cyclohexane, the number of distinct H's is 6, because each carbon has two identical H's, but each carbon's H's are in a different environment.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because in cyclohexane, the molecule is symmetric. So the H's on adjacent carbons are all equivalent in pairs. For example, in a chair, the axial H's on adjacent carbons are all equivalent, and the equatorial H's are all equivalent. So in that case, cyclohexane has two sets of equivalent H's: axial and equatorial. So the number of distinct H's would be 2.

But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because each axial H is in a different position. No, actually, in cyclohexane's chair conformation, all axial H's are in equivalent positions because the ring can rotate, making all axial H's equivalent. Similarly, all equatorial H's are equivalent.

Wait, but then that would mean that cyclohexane has only two types of H's: axial and equatorial. So if product 4 is cyclohexane, then the number of chemically distinct H's would be 2. But looking at the options, the choices are 6, 8, 10, 7. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are incorrect. Maybe the first step doesn't produce 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Let me reconsider step 1.

Step 1: cyclohexanone treated with bromine.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Another possible reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine is the formation of a dihydroxybromide via an addition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination of the carbonyl group via the enol mechanism, adding a Br across the double bond of the enol. So the product would be a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, leading to addition of Br across the carbonyl group. No, wait, ketones don't typically add bromine in that way; alkenes do.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromide via the acid-catalyzed enol formation, leading to addition of Br. So when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, it could form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a bromination at the alpha position, adding a single Br, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction of ketones with bromine. So, from what I recall, ketones can undergo bromination at the alpha position using a brominating agent like Br2 in a base. The alpha position is more reactive because of the presence of the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group, which makes the alpha hydrogens more acidic. So, the base could deprotonate the alpha C, generating an enolate, which then reacts with Br2.

So, in step 1, cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, perhaps in a basic solution, leading to the formation of a dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Okay, so product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Then, product 1 is treated with NaOH, which is a base. So step 2 would likely involve elimination. Since there are two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone.

Then, step 3: treating cyclohexenone with SOCl2. The ketone would be converted into an acyl chloride. So product 3 would be cyclohexenyl chloride, where the ketone O is replaced by Cl. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a Cl attached to the same carbon as the ketone was, and a double bond adjacent to it.

Wait, but if the ketone is replaced by Cl, then the structure would have a Cl in place of the O, so the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Now, step 4: product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. So LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces carbonyl groups, but in this case, the carbonyl has been replaced by Cl. So perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution.

Wait, but in product 3, the Cl is attached to C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps the hydride (H-) attacks C2, leading to elimination of Cl- and formation of a new bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl was, and the double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Let me think of the possible product.

If product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene, and LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the double bond by adding H's across it. So the double bond between C1 and C2 would become a single bond with H's added.

In that case, product 4 would be 1-chlorocyclohexane, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond would have been hydrogenated, leading to a cyclohexane ring with Cl on C1.

Wait, but then, what about the Cl? If the Cl is on C1 and the ring is fully hydrogenated, then product 4 is 1-chlorocyclohexane.

But wait, 1-chlorocyclohexane would have a Cl attached to a CH2 group in the ring. So the structure would be Cl-CH2- in the cyclohexane ring.

In that case, the molecule would be 1-chlorocyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a Cl attached to one of the CH2 groups.

Now, the question is: how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4?

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, each carbon in the ring is attached to two CH2 groups, except the carbon with the Cl. Let me imagine the structure. So, the Cl is on C1, and the ring is cyclohexane. So each adjacent carbon (C2 and C6) would have CH2 groups, and the rest would have CH2 groups as well.

Wait, but 1-chlorocyclohexane has a Cl attached to one carbon in the ring. The ring has six carbons. So, the molecule would have:

- C1: Cl attached, with two CH2 groups adjacent (C2 and C6).
- C2 and C6: each has two CH2 groups and a Cl on the adjacent carbon.
- The other carbons (C3, C4, C5) would each have two CH2 groups.

Now, the H's on each carbon would be in different environments. Let's think about the symmetry.

The molecule 1-chlorocyclohexane would have a plane of symmetry through the Cl and the opposite carbon (C4), perhaps. But wait, depending on the substituent, the symmetry changes.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let's imagine the chair conformation. The Cl would be axial or equatorial. But regardless, the ring would have an axis of symmetry through the Cl and the opposite carbon.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, so each H is in a unique environment.

But I'm trying to count the number of chemically distinct H's.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, the Cl is on one carbon. The ring is otherwise symmetric in some way.

Wait, each carbon in the ring would have two H's. But because of the Cl, the environments of the H's on each carbon would be different.

Let me break it down:

- C1: Cl attached. The two H's on C1 are equivalent because they're on the same carbon. But C1 is unique because of the Cl.
- C2: adjacent to C1. The two H's on C2 are in a different environment than C3, etc. So the H's on C2 are another set.
- Similarly, C6 is adjacent to C1 and would have H's in the same environment as C2.
- C3: next to C2 and C4. Its H's are another set.
- C4: opposite C1 (assuming a six-membered ring), so symmetric to C1. Wait, no, because the Cl is on C1, so C4 is the opposite. So C4's H's may be a unique set.
- C5: adjacent to C4 and C6.
- C6: adjacent to C5 and C1.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me think of the molecule as having different types of H's based on their positions relative to the Cl.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, considering the chair conformation, the Cl would be axial, and the ring would have certain symmetries. The axial Cl would create different environments for the H's on adjacent carbons.

But perhaps the molecule has the following types of H's:

- Two axial H's on C1 (but wait, C1 has Cl, so no H's).
- The axial H's on C2 and C6 (if the Cl is axial).
- The axial H's on C3 and C5.
- The axial H's on C4 (if any).
Wait, no, C1 has Cl, so no H's there.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has the following types of H's:

- The H's on C2 and C6 (adjacent to Cl) are equivalent.
- The H's on C3 and C5 are equivalent.
- The H's on C4 are unique.
- The axial and equatorial H's on each carbon could add to the distinctiveness.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the molecule as having the Cl on one carbon, and the ring having different environments for each set of H's.

So:

- C1: no H's (Cl is attached).
- C2 and C6: each has two H's, which are equivalent to each other.
- C3 and C5: each has two H's, equivalent to each other.
- C4: has two H's, which are unique.
- Additionally, the axial and equatorial H's on each carbon may be different.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's imagine the molecule 1-chlorocyclohexane.

In the chair conformation, the Cl is axial. Then, the axial H's on C2 and C6 are pointing up, and the axial H's on C3 and C5 are pointing down. The equatorial H's are arranged in a way that avoids 1,3-diaxial interactions.

So, in this case, the H's on C2 and C6 (axial) are equivalent due to symmetry. The H's on C3 and C5 (axial) are another set. The equatorial H's on C2 and C6 are another set. The equatorial H's on C3 and C5 are another set. The axial H's on C4 would be a unique set, and the equatorial H's on C4 another.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has the following types of H's:

1. Axial H's on C2 and C6.
2. Equatorial H's on C2 and C6.
3. Axial H's on C3 and C5.
4. Equatorial H's on C3 and C5.
5. Axial H's on C4.
6. Equatorial H's on C4.

But wait, that would give 6 different types, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct H's is 6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6. So perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to recount.

If the final product is 1-chlorocyclohexane, then each carbon in the ring has two H's, except C1 (which has Cl). So the molecule has six CH2 groups, but with different environments.

But wait, C1 has Cl, so the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) are next to a Cl. The next carbons (C3 and C5) are next to C2 and C6. C4 is opposite the Cl.

In such a structure, the H's on C2 and C6 would be equivalent, the H's on C3 and C5 would be equivalent, and the H's on C4 would be unique. Additionally, the axial and equatorial positions would create more distinct H's.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think about the number of distinct H's.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, the molecule has the following types of H's:

- The two H's on C2: equivalent to each other (but different from others).
- The two H's on C3: equivalent to each other.
- The two H's on C4: equivalent to each other.
- The two H's on C5: equivalent to each other.
- The two H's on C6: equivalent to each other.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because C2 and C6 are adjacent to Cl, so their H's are in a different environment than C3 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon's H's are in a unique environment, leading to six distinct H's.

But wait, no, because C2 and C6 are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. Similarly, C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 is unique.

So, the H's on C2 and C6 are equivalent (two types of H's: axial and equatorial?), the H's on C3 and C5 are another set, and C4 has another set.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me count the distinct H's.

Assuming that in 1-chlorocyclohexane:

- C1 has no H's (Cl attached).
- C2 and C6 each have two H's, which are equivalent to each other.
- C3 and C5 each have two H's, which are equivalent to each other.
- C4 has two H's, which are unique.

But each of these sets (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4) would have their H's in a different environment, so each set counts as a distinct type.

Additionally, considering the axial and equatorial positions, each of these sets would have two types of H's: axial and equatorial.

So, for C2 and C6: axial H's and equatorial H's (two types).
For C3 and C5: axial and equatorial (two types).
For C4: axial and equatorial (two types).

Wait, that would make 3 carbons × 2 types each = 6 distinct H's. But that seems high.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count each type based on their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for a pattern.

Wait, another approach: if product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine substituent, then the molecule has a certain symmetry that reduces the number of distinct H's. For example, if the chlorine is in a position that makes some H's equivalent.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a different structure altogether.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and product 4 is not 1-chlorocyclohexane.

Let me retrace all steps.

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone + NaOH → cyclohexenone (elimination of two Br's to form a double bond).

Step 3: cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → cyclohexenyl chloride (Cl replaces ketone O).

Step 4: cyclohexenyl chloride + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → ?

Now, for step 4, perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to a substitution.

Wait, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent. In this case, perhaps it's acting as a nucleophile, where the hydride replaces the Cl.

So, in product 3, which is 1-chlorocyclohexene, when treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, leading to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that would mean product 4 is cyclohexane. But cyclohexane has six equivalent H's, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, no, that's not correct because in cyclohexane, the H's are not all equivalent. Earlier confusion arises because of this.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure of product 3. Let me think again.

Product 3: cyclohexenone treated with SOCl2 → cyclohexenyl chloride.

Wait, cyclohexenone's structure is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. Treating with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to Cl, making the structure Cl-C=CH-... in the ring.

So product 3 is 3-chlorocyclohexene? Or perhaps 1-chlorocyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the Cl is on the same carbon as the carbonyl, which is now replaced by Cl, but the double bond is adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, with a double bond between C1 and C2.

So when treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, perhaps the Cl leaves, and the hydride attacks C2, leading to the formation of C-H bond and the elimination of Cl-.

Wait, but then the double bond would shift or hydrogenate. Alternatively, perhaps the hydride adds to the double bond, leading to a reduction.

Hmm, perhaps the correct product 4 is cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl and double bond were.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2Cl group, but that doesn't make sense because the Cl was replaced by H.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the final product is a cyclohexanol derivative, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is reducing the ketone, but wait, product 3 doesn't have a ketone anymore. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction in step 4 is an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a new bond and the elimination of Cl.

In that case, product 4 would have a new single bond where the Cl was, and the double bond would be hydrogenated.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the number of distinct H's.

If product 4 is 1-chlorocyclohexane, then the number of distinct H's would be:

- C1: no H's.
- C2 and C6: each has two H's, which are equivalent.
- C3 and C5: each has two H's, which are equivalent.
- C4: has two H's, which are equivalent.

But then, each of these sets (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4) would have two H's, but in different environments. Additionally, considering axial and equatorial positions, each set would split into two types.

So, for C2 and C6, axial H's and equatorial H's → 2 types.
For C3 and C5, same → 2 types.
For C4, same → 2 types.

Total = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

So the number of chemically distinct H's would be 6. So the answer would be option A)6.

But wait, the options include D)7, which is close. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has more distinct H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think again. If product 4 is a cyclohexane with a CH2 group adjacent to where the Cl was, perhaps the H's are arranged in a way that increases the number of distinct types.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2Cl group, but that doesn't make sense because Cl was replaced by H.

Hmm. I'm not confident, but based on the earlier reasoning, I think the answer is 6, which is option A.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone, and the goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

### Reaction Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂)**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha position (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). This forms **1,2-dibromocyclohexanone**, where bromine atoms are added to the two alpha carbons.

2. **Step 2: 1,2-Dibromocyclohexanone + NaOH**  
   Heating with sodium hydroxide induces an elimination reaction, removing the two bromine atoms and forming a double bond. The product is **cyclohexenone**, a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group and a double bond.

3. **Step 3: Cyclohexenone + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂)**  
   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group (C=O) into a chlorinated carbon (C-Cl). The product is **1-chlorocyclohexene**, where the carbonyl is replaced by chlorine, and the double bond remains between the two adjacent carbons.

4. **Step 4: 1-Chlorocyclohexene + Lithium Tri-Tert-Butoxyaluminum Hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃)**  
   This strong reducing agent replaces the chlorine atom with a hydrogen atom and reduces the double bond, fully saturating the ring. The final product is **1-chlorocyclohexane**, a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine atom attached to one carbon.

### Determining Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in 1-Chlorocyclohexane:

1. **Structure of 1-Chlorocyclohexane**:  
   - The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine atom attached to one carbon (C1).  
   - The remaining carbons (C2–C6) are CH₂ groups.

2. **Symmetry and Distinct Hydrogens**:  
   - **C1**: No hydrogen atoms (chlorine is attached).  
   - **C2 and C6**: These carbons are adjacent to C1 and are in equivalent environments. Each has two hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C3 and C5**: These carbons are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. Each has two hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C4**: This carbon is opposite C1 and is unique. It has two hydrogen atoms.  

3. **Counting Distinct Hydrogens**:  
   - **C2 and C6**: 2 equivalent hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C3 and C5**: 2 equivalent hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C4**: 2 unique hydrogen atoms.  

Thus, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 1-chlorocyclohexane is **6**.

### Final Answer:
The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **6**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I'll need to figure out each step, the products formed, and then determine how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. Structure-wise, that's a six-membered cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (a carbonyl) attached. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an O double-bonded to a carbon that's attached to two more CH2 groups or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Cyclohexanone is cyclohexane with a ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group (C=O). So the structure is a chair conformation where the carbonyl is in a fixed position.

Step 1: Treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Hmm, what does that do? I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions. Wait, bromine is Br2, and in what solvent? Well, I think when ketones are treated with bromine, especially in a non-polar solvent, it might undergo a bromination via a certain mechanism. Oh wait, another possibility: the cyclohexanone has an alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) that can undergo addition reactions. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? Or perhaps it's an addition across the carbonyl, but wait, ketones don't usually add bromine like alkenes do. Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone might not react with bromine under normal conditions. Wait, another thought: perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that requires dienes. Wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, oh wait, there's another possibility. The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, and when treated with bromine, perhaps it undergoes a bromination via the enol mechanism. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another reaction comes to mind: the ketone can undergo an aldol addition, but that's with another ketone or aldehyde. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, another possibility: perhaps the ketone is undergoing a cyclohexenone formation. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, I think the correct reaction here is that the ketone undergoes a bromination at the alpha position. So the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are sites for bromine addition. So cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha carbons (since it's a ring), each with two H's. So when treated with bromine, maybe it adds a bromine across the double bond if it's conjugated. Wait, no, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing a ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. Another possibility is that the ketone forms an enol, which can then react with bromine. The enol has a double bond between the alpha carbons. So bromine could add across that. So when the enol attacks Br2, it could add across the double bond, leading to dibromide. Wait, but wait, the enol is more reactive. So when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, which is a dienophile perhaps? Or maybe it's an addition to the enol.

Wait, I think the correct product is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. But wait, let me clarify. The starting material is cyclohexanone. When treated with bromine, perhaps it's undergoing a halogenation at the alpha positions. So the reaction could be the addition of Br to the alpha carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed process where the enol forms, and then Br adds.

Wait, another approach: maybe the first step is a bromination of the cyclohexanone via the alpha position. So the product 1 would have a bromine added to the alpha carbon. Since the starting material is a ketone, the alpha positions are the carbons next to the carbonyl. In cyclohexanone, each of those has two hydrogens. So the bromine could add to one or both of those positions.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, no, that's when you have an epoxide opening, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-addition? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the cyclohexanone is treated with a solution of bromine in a solvent like dichloromethane. In such cases, the ketone's alpha carbons can undergo bromination via a radical mechanism or an ionic mechanism.

Wait, no, another possibility: I'm confusing this with the benzaldehyde bromination. Benzaldehyde can undergo bromination at the alpha position using a brominating agent like Br2 in a basic solution, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination via the enol mechanism. The ketone forms an enol, which is more reactive towards electrophiles. Then, Br2 could add to the double bond of the enol, leading to the formation of a 1,2-dibromide.

Wait, so cyclohexanone's enol would be a cyclohexene with the oxygen as part of the conjugated system. Then, adding Br2 would add across the double bond, leading to 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. So product 1 would have two bromine atoms added to the two adjacent alpha carbons.

Wait, but let me think again. When you add bromine to an enol, you would get a 1,2-dibromide. So the product would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the ring. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but perhaps the first step is a bromination at the alpha position without the enol. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more like a substitution, but that doesn't make much sense because the alpha carbons are not particularly nucleophilic.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromide via the mechanism where the carbonyl oxygen acts as a base, abstracting a proton from the alpha carbon to form an enolate, which then attacks Br2. So the enolate would have negative charge on the alpha carbon, which would attack Br2, leading to the addition of Br.

Wait, so the enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon, and then Br2 would add across. So product 1 would have two bromines added on adjacent carbons, making it a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Okay, moving on. Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2.

Hmm, sodium hydroxide is a strong base. So what could happen when 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone is treated with NaOH? Well, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two adjacent bromine atoms, perhaps they can eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, yes, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone, then when heated with a base like NaOH, it would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a double bond. So the two Br atoms would leave, and two H's would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons where the Br atoms were.

So product 2 would be cyclohexene with a ketone. Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone has a ring, so if the double bond forms between two adjacent carbons, that would give cyclohexenone. So product 2 is cyclohexenone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone group and a double bond.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the structure. The starting product after the first step is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. So the structure would have the ketone at a certain position, and two adjacent Br atoms on the next two carbons. So when eliminating, the two Brs would leave, but that would form a double bond between those two carbons.

So product 2 would be cyclohexenone, which is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. So the ring has a carbonyl and a double bond adjacent to it.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3.

Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone. Wait, when a ketone is treated with thionyl chloride, it usually converts the ketone into an acyl chloride. So, cyclohexenone (the ketone) would react with SOCl2 to form cyclohexenyl chloride? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the ketone (R-CO-R') becomes R-COCl. So if product 2 is cyclohexenone (structure is cyclohexene with a ketone), then treating with SOCl2 would replace the ketone oxygen with a Cl, so product 3 would be cyclohexenyl chloride, specifically, cyclohexenyl chloroketone? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if it's cyclohexenone, the structure is:

O
||
C-Ring (with a double bond)

So when treated with SOCl2, the ketone group (O) becomes Cl. So product 3 would be cyclohexenyl chloride, but wait, where is the Cl attached? Let me think. The ketone is at one position, so after reaction with SOCl2, the carbonyl becomes a Cl. So the structure becomes Cl-C with a double bond in the ring. So product 3 is cyclohexenyl chloride, where the carbonyl has been replaced by Cl. Wait, but wait, no, that's not right. So cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone. After step 1, it's 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Step 2 gives cyclohexenone. Step 3 is treating cyclohexenone with SOCl2. So the ketone (O) becomes Cl. So product 3 is cyclohexenyl chloride, where the carbonyl is now a Cl. So structure-wise, it's a cyclohexene ring with a Cl attached to a carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: when cyclohexenone (the ketone) is treated with SOCl2, it forms cyclohexenyl chloride, but wait, no, the ketone is converted to an acyl chloride. Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone. When you treat it with SOCl2, you get cyclohexyl chloride, but more accurately, the ketone becomes an acyl chloride. So structure would be Cl-C=O, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. No, when a ketone is treated with SOCl2, it's converted to an acyl chloride. So for cyclohexanone, the product would be cyclohexyl chloroketone? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Ah, no, the correct reaction is that the ketone (R-CO-R') reacts with SOCl2 to form R-COCl and HCl and SO2. So, for cyclohexanone, it would form cyclohexyl chloride, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the ketone group (C=O) becomes a C=Cl. So the product is cyclohexyl chloroketone? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps the correct product is cyclohexyl chloride, but I'm getting confused now.

Wait, maybe I should just think of the product as cyclohexenyl chloride. No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to write it.

Cyclohexenone is:

O
||
C-Ring (with a double bond)

When treated with SOCl2, the ketone group (O) becomes Cl, so it becomes:

Cl
|
C-Ring (with a double bond)

Wait, no, that's a chlorinated carbon, but the structure would be Cl-C=CH2 in the ring. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. So, cyclohexenone is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. When treated with SOCl2, the ketone O is replaced by Cl. So the product would be a chlorinated cyclohexene, but where? The ketone was at position 1, so after reaction, the Cl would be at position 1, and the double bond is between positions 1 and 2? Wait, no, the double bond in cyclohexenone is between C1 and C2, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ketone is at C1. So after treatment with SOCl2, the C1 becomes Cl. So the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with Cl at C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would make the structure a chlorinated compound with a double bond adjacent to the Cl. Hmm, that might form an allyl chloride.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent this as a cyclohexene ring where the carbonyl has been replaced by Cl. So product 3 is Cl-C=CH2 in the ring. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, but perhaps the correct structure is that the ketone is converted into a Cl, so the carbonyl becomes a Cl, and the adjacent double bond remains. So product 3 is a chlorinated cyclohexene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction of the ketone with SOCl2 doesn't change the double bond. So if product 2 is cyclohexenone, which has a double bond between C1 and C2, for example, and a ketone at C1. Then, treating with SOCl2 would convert the ketone into Cl, so the structure would be Cl attached to C1, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule would have a Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but then the structure would be a cyclohexene with a Cl on C1, adjacent to the double bond. So product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

Moving on to step 4: Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), forming product 4.

LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, but it's also a selective one. I remember that it's a bulky reducing agent and tends to effect hydride reductions in a less hindered environment.

Looking at product 3: if it's 1-chlorocyclohexene, then when treated with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH(t-Bu)3, what would happen? Well, 1-chlorocyclohexene is a chlorinated alkene.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps product 3 is a ketone again, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, product 2 was cyclohexenone (a ketone), product 3 is the result of treating it with SOCl2, which converts the ketone into Cl. So product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

So, when treating 1-chlorocyclohexene with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, what happens? Well, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce alkenes, but under certain conditions. Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the Cl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Cl is a leaving group. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is present, maybe it acts as a base and induces elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the chlorinated alkene would undergo a reduction. Wait, but LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is primarily a reducing agent, but maybe it can also perform other reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the reducing agent provides H- which could lead to some kind of attack.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Cl is at a position adjacent to a double bond. Let's imagine the structure is Cl attached to C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C1=C2-CH2-... etc. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps the H- would attack the double bond in a conjugate addition.

But wait, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups, but in this case, perhaps it's acting on the alkene.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the reducing agent provides a hydride which attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydride would add to the double bond, but considering the structure, it's more likely that the hydride would attack the less substituted end due to the bulky nature of the reducing agent (steric effects). So, in a less substituted position, the hydride would add to the less hindered carbon.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think step by step.

Product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the double bond. But wait, LiAlH is generally used to reduce carbonyl groups, not alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl leaves, and the hydride adds to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another approach: the structure of product 3 is Cl attached to C1, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, H- would attack the double bond. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by a hydride, but that would form an alkane.

Wait, if the Cl leaves (as a Cl-), and the H- attacks C1, then what happens? The structure would become CH2Cl, but wait, no, because the Cl would leave, and the hydride would add. Hmm, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where Cl is replaced by H. So product 4 would be cyclohexane with H added where the Cl was.

Wait, but wait, the structure of product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps it performs a substitution, replacing Cl with H. That would give cyclohexene with H in place of Cl. But then, what happens to the double bond? Perhaps the H adds to the double bond, reducing it.

Wait, so maybe product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with an additional H where the Cl was.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is reduced, leading to cyclohexane.

Wait, but LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, so perhaps it would reduce the double bond. So in that case, the double bond in the cyclohexene would be hydrogenated, leading to cyclohexane with a Cl in the ring.

Wait, but LiAlH is more often used for carbonyl reductions, not so much for alkene reductions. So perhaps the main reaction is the substitution of Cl with H.

Wait, so product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene. When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, and a good source of H-, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H. So product 4 would be cyclohexene with H in place of Cl. But wait, that would form cyclohexene with CH2 groups. But wait, no, the substitution would lead to a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1-chlorocyclohexene has Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps it's a hydride reduction that adds H- to the double bond. So the double bond would be hydrogenated, turning into a single bond. But since LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it would add H to both ends of the double bond, leading to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on this step. Let me think about the possible product.

If product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene, and product 4 is made by treating it with a strong reducing agent, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated. So product 4 would be cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl was. Wait, but that would mean the ring is saturated and the Cl is replaced by H.

Wait, but if the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, then product 4 would be cyclohexane with all single bonds and a CH2 group where the Cl was. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring, perhaps with a CH2 group attached where the Cl was.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is only performing a substitution, not a reduction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the hydride acts as a nucleophile, replacing Cl. So product 4 would be cyclohexene with H added where the Cl was, but that doesn't make sense because substitution would require a single bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of some sort.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the Cl leaving, and the hydride adding to the adjacent carbon. So the double bond would shift or change, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is eliminated, and the hydride adds to the double bond. So the product would have an additional H from the hydride.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 4 as cyclohexane, with two H's added where the Cl was and the double bond.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to summarize:

- Product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

- Product 4 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3.

- LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, so perhaps it reduces the double bond, adding H's. But since it's a bulky agent, perhaps it adds in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration, but LiAlH isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, leading to cyclohexane with a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cyclohexane with a methyl group. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond remains, but that doesn't make sense as a reduction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.

So, product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene.

When treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, a strong reducing agent, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated.

So product 4 would be cyclohexane, with a CH2 group where the Cl was.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have six CH2 groups, making it cyclohexane, which would have all H's equivalent, but that's not the case. Or wait, no, because the substitution might create some symmetry.

Wait, but if the Cl was at a position that, when replaced, makes the molecule symmetric, then the number of distinct H's would be fewer.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is cyclohexane with a CH2Cl group, but no, the Cl is replaced by H.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane, with a CH2 group where the Cl was, but the ring is now fully hydrogenated. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the ring is already six-membered. So perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2 group at a certain position.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Maybe the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, leading to a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl was. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group on one carbon.

Wait, but that would mean the molecule has two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is cyclohexane without any substituents because the Cl is replaced by H and the double bond is hydrogenated. But that would make product 4 cyclohexane, which has all equivalent H's in the ring, but wait, no, cyclohexane's H's are not all equivalent. In fact, cyclohexane has H's in different positions, but all H's on a given carbon are equivalent.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a symmetric molecule, so perhaps all H's are equivalent, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, no, in chair conformations, axial and equatorial H's are different, but in terms of chemical equivalence, all H's on the same carbon are equivalent, but different carbons have different H's.

Wait, but if product 4 is cyclohexane, then how many distinct H's would it have? Well, cyclohexane has two types of H's: axial and equatorial, but in reality, they are not chemically equivalent. Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane, the H's on each carbon are equivalent, but each carbon's H's are a different set.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of cyclohexane: each carbon has two H's, and each set of equivalent H's is on the same carbon. So, for a cyclohexane ring, the number of chemically distinct H's would depend on the symmetry.

Wait, for cyclohexane, which is a chair conformation, each carbon's H's are equivalent, but the axial and equatorial positions are different. But in terms of chemical equivalence under normal circumstances, the H's on each carbon are equivalent, but the H's on adjacent carbons are not.

Wait, but in reality, all the H's in cyclohexane are not all equivalent. For example, in a chair conformation, each axial H is equivalent to others in that position, but equatorial H's are different. So the number of distinct H's in cyclohexane is 2: axial and equatorial. But wait, that's not correct because each carbon has two H's, but in the ring, each carbon's H's are in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. If product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with all CH2 groups, then each CH2 has two H's that are equivalent. But in a cyclohexane ring, each CH2 group is equivalent to others only if the molecule has symmetry.

Wait, but if product 4 is a cyclohexane with all CH2 groups and no substituents, then each carbon's H's are equivalent within their own carbon. So, for a cyclohexane ring, each carbon has two H's, and each of these sets is equivalent within the ring. So the number of distinct H's would be six, because each of the six carbons has a unique set of H's.

No, wait: in cyclohexane, each pair of H's on a carbon are equivalent, but each carbon's H's are not equivalent to the next. So in cyclohexane, the number of distinct H's is 6, because each carbon has two identical H's, but each carbon's H's are in a different environment.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because in cyclohexane, the molecule is symmetric. So the H's on adjacent carbons are all equivalent in pairs. For example, in a chair, the axial H's on adjacent carbons are all equivalent, and the equatorial H's are all equivalent. So in that case, cyclohexane has two sets of equivalent H's: axial and equatorial. So the number of distinct H's would be 2.

But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because each axial H is in a different position. No, actually, in cyclohexane's chair conformation, all axial H's are in equivalent positions because the ring can rotate, making all axial H's equivalent. Similarly, all equatorial H's are equivalent.

Wait, but then that would mean that cyclohexane has only two types of H's: axial and equatorial. So if product 4 is cyclohexane, then the number of chemically distinct H's would be 2. But looking at the options, the choices are 6, 8, 10, 7. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are incorrect. Maybe the first step doesn't produce 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Let me reconsider step 1.

Step 1: cyclohexanone treated with bromine.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Another possible reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine is the formation of a dihydroxybromide via an addition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination of the carbonyl group via the enol mechanism, adding a Br across the double bond of the enol. So the product would be a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, leading to addition of Br across the carbonyl group. No, wait, ketones don't typically add bromine in that way; alkenes do.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromide via the acid-catalyzed enol formation, leading to addition of Br. So when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, it could form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a bromination at the alpha position, adding a single Br, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction of ketones with bromine. So, from what I recall, ketones can undergo bromination at the alpha position using a brominating agent like Br2 in a base. The alpha position is more reactive because of the presence of the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group, which makes the alpha hydrogens more acidic. So, the base could deprotonate the alpha C, generating an enolate, which then reacts with Br2.

So, in step 1, cyclohexanone is treated with Br2, perhaps in a basic solution, leading to the formation of a dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Okay, so product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Then, product 1 is treated with NaOH, which is a base. So step 2 would likely involve elimination. Since there are two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone.

Then, step 3: treating cyclohexenone with SOCl2. The ketone would be converted into an acyl chloride. So product 3 would be cyclohexenyl chloride, where the ketone O is replaced by Cl. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a Cl attached to the same carbon as the ketone was, and a double bond adjacent to it.

Wait, but if the ketone is replaced by Cl, then the structure would have a Cl in place of the O, so the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with Cl on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Now, step 4: product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. So LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces carbonyl groups, but in this case, the carbonyl has been replaced by Cl. So perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution.

Wait, but in product 3, the Cl is attached to C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So when LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is added, perhaps the hydride (H-) attacks C2, leading to elimination of Cl- and formation of a new bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl was, and the double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Let me think of the possible product.

If product 3 is 1-chlorocyclohexene, and LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the double bond by adding H's across it. So the double bond between C1 and C2 would become a single bond with H's added.

In that case, product 4 would be 1-chlorocyclohexane, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond would have been hydrogenated, leading to a cyclohexane ring with Cl on C1.

Wait, but then, what about the Cl? If the Cl is on C1 and the ring is fully hydrogenated, then product 4 is 1-chlorocyclohexane.

But wait, 1-chlorocyclohexane would have a Cl attached to a CH2 group in the ring. So the structure would be Cl-CH2- in the cyclohexane ring.

In that case, the molecule would be 1-chlorocyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a Cl attached to one of the CH2 groups.

Now, the question is: how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4?

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, each carbon in the ring is attached to two CH2 groups, except the carbon with the Cl. Let me imagine the structure. So, the Cl is on C1, and the ring is cyclohexane. So each adjacent carbon (C2 and C6) would have CH2 groups, and the rest would have CH2 groups as well.

Wait, but 1-chlorocyclohexane has a Cl attached to one carbon in the ring. The ring has six carbons. So, the molecule would have:

- C1: Cl attached, with two CH2 groups adjacent (C2 and C6).
- C2 and C6: each has two CH2 groups and a Cl on the adjacent carbon.
- The other carbons (C3, C4, C5) would each have two CH2 groups.

Now, the H's on each carbon would be in different environments. Let's think about the symmetry.

The molecule 1-chlorocyclohexane would have a plane of symmetry through the Cl and the opposite carbon (C4), perhaps. But wait, depending on the substituent, the symmetry changes.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let's imagine the chair conformation. The Cl would be axial or equatorial. But regardless, the ring would have an axis of symmetry through the Cl and the opposite carbon.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, so each H is in a unique environment.

But I'm trying to count the number of chemically distinct H's.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, the Cl is on one carbon. The ring is otherwise symmetric in some way.

Wait, each carbon in the ring would have two H's. But because of the Cl, the environments of the H's on each carbon would be different.

Let me break it down:

- C1: Cl attached. The two H's on C1 are equivalent because they're on the same carbon. But C1 is unique because of the Cl.
- C2: adjacent to C1. The two H's on C2 are in a different environment than C3, etc. So the H's on C2 are another set.
- Similarly, C6 is adjacent to C1 and would have H's in the same environment as C2.
- C3: next to C2 and C4. Its H's are another set.
- C4: opposite C1 (assuming a six-membered ring), so symmetric to C1. Wait, no, because the Cl is on C1, so C4 is the opposite. So C4's H's may be a unique set.
- C5: adjacent to C4 and C6.
- C6: adjacent to C5 and C1.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me think of the molecule as having different types of H's based on their positions relative to the Cl.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, considering the chair conformation, the Cl would be axial, and the ring would have certain symmetries. The axial Cl would create different environments for the H's on adjacent carbons.

But perhaps the molecule has the following types of H's:

- Two axial H's on C1 (but wait, C1 has Cl, so no H's).
- The axial H's on C2 and C6 (if the Cl is axial).
- The axial H's on C3 and C5.
- The axial H's on C4 (if any).
Wait, no, C1 has Cl, so no H's there.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has the following types of H's:

- The H's on C2 and C6 (adjacent to Cl) are equivalent.
- The H's on C3 and C5 are equivalent.
- The H's on C4 are unique.
- The axial and equatorial H's on each carbon could add to the distinctiveness.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the molecule as having the Cl on one carbon, and the ring having different environments for each set of H's.

So:

- C1: no H's (Cl is attached).
- C2 and C6: each has two H's, which are equivalent to each other.
- C3 and C5: each has two H's, equivalent to each other.
- C4: has two H's, which are unique.
- Additionally, the axial and equatorial H's on each carbon may be different.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's imagine the molecule 1-chlorocyclohexane.

In the chair conformation, the Cl is axial. Then, the axial H's on C2 and C6 are pointing up, and the axial H's on C3 and C5 are pointing down. The equatorial H's are arranged in a way that avoids 1,3-diaxial interactions.

So, in this case, the H's on C2 and C6 (axial) are equivalent due to symmetry. The H's on C3 and C5 (axial) are another set. The equatorial H's on C2 and C6 are another set. The equatorial H's on C3 and C5 are another set. The axial H's on C4 would be a unique set, and the equatorial H's on C4 another.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has the following types of H's:

1. Axial H's on C2 and C6.
2. Equatorial H's on C2 and C6.
3. Axial H's on C3 and C5.
4. Equatorial H's on C3 and C5.
5. Axial H's on C4.
6. Equatorial H's on C4.

But wait, that would give 6 different types, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct H's is 6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6. So perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to recount.

If the final product is 1-chlorocyclohexane, then each carbon in the ring has two H's, except C1 (which has Cl). So the molecule has six CH2 groups, but with different environments.

But wait, C1 has Cl, so the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) are next to a Cl. The next carbons (C3 and C5) are next to C2 and C6. C4 is opposite the Cl.

In such a structure, the H's on C2 and C6 would be equivalent, the H's on C3 and C5 would be equivalent, and the H's on C4 would be unique. Additionally, the axial and equatorial positions would create more distinct H's.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think about the number of distinct H's.

In 1-chlorocyclohexane, the molecule has the following types of H's:

- The two H's on C2: equivalent to each other (but different from others).
- The two H's on C3: equivalent to each other.
- The two H's on C4: equivalent to each other.
- The two H's on C5: equivalent to each other.
- The two H's on C6: equivalent to each other.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because C2 and C6 are adjacent to Cl, so their H's are in a different environment than C3 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon's H's are in a unique environment, leading to six distinct H's.

But wait, no, because C2 and C6 are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. Similarly, C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 is unique.

So, the H's on C2 and C6 are equivalent (two types of H's: axial and equatorial?), the H's on C3 and C5 are another set, and C4 has another set.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me count the distinct H's.

Assuming that in 1-chlorocyclohexane:

- C1 has no H's (Cl attached).
- C2 and C6 each have two H's, which are equivalent to each other.
- C3 and C5 each have two H's, which are equivalent to each other.
- C4 has two H's, which are unique.

But each of these sets (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4) would have their H's in a different environment, so each set counts as a distinct type.

Additionally, considering the axial and equatorial positions, each of these sets would have two types of H's: axial and equatorial.

So, for C2 and C6: axial H's and equatorial H's (two types).
For C3 and C5: axial and equatorial (two types).
For C4: axial and equatorial (two types).

Wait, that would make 3 carbons × 2 types each = 6 distinct H's. But that seems high.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count each type based on their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for a pattern.

Wait, another approach: if product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine substituent, then the molecule has a certain symmetry that reduces the number of distinct H's. For example, if the chlorine is in a position that makes some H's equivalent.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a different structure altogether.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and product 4 is not 1-chlorocyclohexane.

Let me retrace all steps.

Step 1: cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone + NaOH → cyclohexenone (elimination of two Br's to form a double bond).

Step 3: cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → cyclohexenyl chloride (Cl replaces ketone O).

Step 4: cyclohexenyl chloride + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → ?

Now, for step 4, perhaps the Cl is a good leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to a substitution.

Wait, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent. In this case, perhaps it's acting as a nucleophile, where the hydride replaces the Cl.

So, in product 3, which is 1-chlorocyclohexene, when treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, perhaps the Cl is replaced by H, and the double bond is hydrogenated, leading to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that would mean product 4 is cyclohexane. But cyclohexane has six equivalent H's, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, no, that's not correct because in cyclohexane, the H's are not all equivalent. Earlier confusion arises because of this.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure of product 3. Let me think again.

Product 3: cyclohexenone treated with SOCl2 → cyclohexenyl chloride.

Wait, cyclohexenone's structure is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. Treating with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to Cl, making the structure Cl-C=CH-... in the ring.

So product 3 is 3-chlorocyclohexene? Or perhaps 1-chlorocyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the Cl is on the same carbon as the carbonyl, which is now replaced by Cl, but the double bond is adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, with a double bond between C1 and C2.

So when treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, perhaps the Cl leaves, and the hydride attacks C2, leading to the formation of C-H bond and the elimination of Cl-.

Wait, but then the double bond would shift or hydrogenate. Alternatively, perhaps the hydride adds to the double bond, leading to a reduction.

Hmm, perhaps the correct product 4 is cyclohexane with a CH2 group where the Cl and double bond were.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2Cl group, but that doesn't make sense because the Cl was replaced by H.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the final product is a cyclohexanol derivative, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is reducing the ketone, but wait, product 3 doesn't have a ketone anymore. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction in step 4 is an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is a leaving group, and the hydride attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a new bond and the elimination of Cl.

In that case, product 4 would have a new single bond where the Cl was, and the double bond would be hydrogenated.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the number of distinct H's.

If product 4 is 1-chlorocyclohexane, then the number of distinct H's would be:

- C1: no H's.
- C2 and C6: each has two H's, which are equivalent.
- C3 and C5: each has two H's, which are equivalent.
- C4: has two H's, which are equivalent.

But then, each of these sets (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4) would have two H's, but in different environments. Additionally, considering axial and equatorial positions, each set would split into two types.

So, for C2 and C6, axial H's and equatorial H's → 2 types.
For C3 and C5, same → 2 types.
For C4, same → 2 types.

Total = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

So the number of chemically distinct H's would be 6. So the answer would be option A)6.

But wait, the options include D)7, which is close. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has more distinct H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think again. If product 4 is a cyclohexane with a CH2 group adjacent to where the Cl was, perhaps the H's are arranged in a way that increases the number of distinct types.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexane with a CH2Cl group, but that doesn't make sense because Cl was replaced by H.

Hmm. I'm not confident, but based on the earlier reasoning, I think the answer is 6, which is option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone, and the goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

### Reaction Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂)**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha position (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). This forms **1,2-dibromocyclohexanone**, where bromine atoms are added to the two alpha carbons.

2. **Step 2: 1,2-Dibromocyclohexanone + NaOH**  
   Heating with sodium hydroxide induces an elimination reaction, removing the two bromine atoms and forming a double bond. The product is **cyclohexenone**, a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group and a double bond.

3. **Step 3: Cyclohexenone + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂)**  
   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group (C=O) into a chlorinated carbon (C-Cl). The product is **1-chlorocyclohexene**, where the carbonyl is replaced by chlorine, and the double bond remains between the two adjacent carbons.

4. **Step 4: 1-Chlorocyclohexene + Lithium Tri-Tert-Butoxyaluminum Hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃)**  
   This strong reducing agent replaces the chlorine atom with a hydrogen atom and reduces the double bond, fully saturating the ring. The final product is **1-chlorocyclohexane**, a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine atom attached to one carbon.

### Determining Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in 1-Chlorocyclohexane:

1. **Structure of 1-Chlorocyclohexane**:  
   - The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a chlorine atom attached to one carbon (C1).  
   - The remaining carbons (C2–C6) are CH₂ groups.

2. **Symmetry and Distinct Hydrogens**:  
   - **C1**: No hydrogen atoms (chlorine is attached).  
   - **C2 and C6**: These carbons are adjacent to C1 and are in equivalent environments. Each has two hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C3 and C5**: These carbons are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. Each has two hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C4**: This carbon is opposite C1 and is unique. It has two hydrogen atoms.  

3. **Counting Distinct Hydrogens**:  
   - **C2 and C6**: 2 equivalent hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C3 and C5**: 2 equivalent hydrogen atoms.  
   - **C4**: 2 unique hydrogen atoms.  

Thus, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 1-chlorocyclohexane is **6**.

### Final Answer:
The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **6**.

**Answer: A**
