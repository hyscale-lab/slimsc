Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. Oh wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. I remember that the orbital period of the binary system is the same as the eclipse period because the eclipses happen when the stars are aligned in their orbit.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the masses are the sum of the two stars in each system.

I think the key here is to relate the radial velocities to the masses of each star. Let me remember the formulas. In a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star will be closer to the center, so it has a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity amplitude. 

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula involving the mass of the companion, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (2.15e5) * (M_p sin i) / (M_total) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_c)) ), but wait maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Or another approach: the mass function relates the velocities to the mass. The mass function for each star is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2π G), but since both stars are orbiting, the sum of their masses relates to their velocities.

Wait, let's think about the mass ratio. Let me denote the two stars in system_1 as M1 and M2, and system_2 as M3 and M4.

In any binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the mass ratio. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has velocity v_B, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A.

So for system_1: the two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2. So the total mass in system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5*M2 + M2 = 1.5*M2.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me think again: the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass. So the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So in system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5. So the mass ratio is v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1/M2 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2. So total mass is M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M3/M4 = v4/v3 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M3 = (2/3) M4. So total mass M_total_2 = (2/3 M4) + M4 = (5/3) M4.

Now, the next part is relating the orbital period to the masses. I remember Kepler's third law which says (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. But wait, the period is given, but I don't have the separation, but perhaps I can find a relation between the masses and the periods.

Alternatively, considering the velocities and the period, we can relate them to the orbital size. The velocity is 2πa/(P), but wait, each star's velocity is v = 2π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the orbit of each star around the center of mass.

Wait, another approach: The mass function in binary stars relates the observed velocities to the masses. But since the system is eclipsing, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So maybe I can use the mass function formula.

The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2π G) )

Similarly, for system_1, K1 = 10 km/s, K2 =5 km/s. The period is 2 years.

Wait, but for each star, the mass function would give the same result because they're in the same system. So let me write the mass function for each system.

For system_1, the mass function f(M1) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2π G).

Wait, but since sin i is close to 1, we can approximate it as 1. So then f(M) = (K^3 P)/(2π G).

But wait, the mass function is the same for both stars. So for system_1, K1 is 10, K2 is 5. But perhaps each K corresponds to a different mass function.

Wait, no, each K is the semi-amplitude of the other star's velocity. So for system_1, star 1 has K1=10, star 2 has K2=5.

So the mass function for star 1 is f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2π G) )

Similarly, for star 2: f2 = (M1^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K2^3 P)/(2π G) )

But since sin i is the same, and P is the same for the system, we can relate f1 and f2.

Let me compute the ratio f1/f2:

f1/f2 = [ (M2³) / (M_total²) ) ] / [ (M1³)/(M_total²) ) ] = (M2³ / M1³) 

But f1/f2 = [ (K1^3 P)/(2π G) ] / [ (K2^3 P)/(2π G) ] ) = (K1/K2)^3

So (M2^3)/(M1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3 → (M2/M1)^3 = (K1/K2)^3 → M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Which brings me back to the earlier conclusion that M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So in system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M2 = 2 M1.

So total mass M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2: K3=15, K4=10.

M3/M4 = K4/K3 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M4 = (3/2) M3.

Total mass M_total_2 = M3 + M4 = M3 + (3/2) M3 = (5/2) M3.

Now, how to relate the total masses to the periods. Because I want to find M_total_1 / M_total_2.

I think I need to use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the total mass and the size of the orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of a binary system: (P^2 G) (M1 + M2) = (4 π²) a^3. But a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Alternatively, the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars is a = a1 + a2.

But each star's velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P.

So for system_1, M1 has a1 and M2 has a2. So M1 a1 = M2 a2 (since the center of mass is the balance point).

So a1 / a2 = M2 / M1 = 2/1 → a1 = 2 a2.

The total separation a = a1 + a2 = 3 a2.

The velocity of M1 is v1 = 2 π a1 / P = 2 π (2 a2) / (2 years) → v1 = 2 π a2 / (1 year).

Wait, let's compute a2 in terms of velocities.

Wait, for M1, v1 = 2 π a1 / P → a1 = (v1 * P)/(2 π).

Similarly, a2 = (v2 * P)/(2 π).

But since a1 = 2 a2, substituting:

(v1 P)/(2 π) )= 2 * (v2 P)/(2 π) → v1 = 2 v2.

Wait, wait, but in system_1, v1 is 10 km/s, v2 is 5 km/s. So 10 = 2 * 5 → yes, that holds. So that makes sense.

But how to relate the masses to the period and velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the total mass of each system in terms of the velocities and periods.

Wait, the total mass (M_total) can be found from the velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me think about the formula.

I remember that for a binary system, the mass function is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P) / (2 π G )

But the mass function f(M) is only a part of the total mass. Wait, but if the inclination i is 90 degrees (which it is for an eclipsing binary, so sin i ≈ 1), then f(M) is (M2^3) / (M_total^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2 π G )

But given that, maybe I can relate the total mass to the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the formula that relates the sum of the masses to the velocities and the period.

Wait, I think the sum of the masses can be found using the formula:

M_total = ( (4 π^2) / (G P^2) ) * (a1 + a2)^3 )

But a1 + a2 = a, the separation. And a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a, a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a.

Wait, but without knowing a, maybe I can express M_total in terms of the velocities.

Wait, each star's velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P.

So a1 = (v1 P) / (2 π ), a2 = (v2 P) / (2 π )

So a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π )

But what is a in Kepler's third law? a is the semi-major axis of the orbit of one star around the other? Or the total separation?

Wait, Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

P^2 = (4 π^2 G) ( (a1 + a2)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2) ) )

So,

(M1 + M2) = (4 π^2 G) (a1 + a2)^3 / P^2

But a1 + a2 = (v1 P)/(2 π ) + (v2 P)/(2 π ) = ( (v1 + v2 ) P ) / (2 π )

So substituting into the mass:

M_total = (4 π^2 G) [ ( (v1 + v2) P )/(2 π ) )^3 ] / P^2

Simplify that.

M_total = (4 π^2 G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/( 8 π^3 ) ) / P^2 

Simplify the numerator and denominator.

= (4 π^2 G) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 P^2 )

= (4 π^2 G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) ) / (8 π^3 )

= ( G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) ) / (2 π )

So, M_total = [ G (v1 + v2)^3 P ] / (2 π )

Wait, let me double-check the algebra.

Alternatively, let's think of it as:

(a1 + a2) = (v1 + v2) * (P/(2π)).

So (a1 + a2)^3 = (v1 + v2)^3 * P^3 / (8 π^3 )

Then, M_total = (4 π^2 G) (a1 + a2)^3 / P^2

= (4 π^2 G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/(8 π^3 ) ) / P^2

= (4 π^2 G) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 P^2 )

= (4 π^2 G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) ) / (8 π^3 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/8 = 1/2; π^2 / π^3 = 1/π.

So,

M_total = ( G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π )

So, M_total = ( G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 π )

Wait, but G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, and the velocities are in km/s. Hmm, but since we're taking the ratio of the masses, maybe the units will cancel out, so perhaps I don't need to get into the actual unit conversions.

So for system_1, M_total_1 = [ G (v1 + v2)^3 P_1 ] / (2 π )

Similarly, M_total_2 = [ G (v3 + v4)^3 P_2 ] / (2 π )

So when we take the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2, the G and 2 π terms cancel.

M_ratio = [ (v1 + v2)^3 P_1 ] / [ (v3 + v4)^3 P_2 ]

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

System_1:

v1 = 10 km/s, v2 =5 km/s → sum is 15 km/s.

P_1 =2 years.

System_2:

v3=15 km/s, v4=10 km/s → sum 25 km/s.

P_2=1 year.

So,

M_ratio = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Compute 15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625.

So,

M_ratio = (3375 * 2) / (15625 * 1) = 6750 / 15625

Simplify that fraction. Let's compute 6750 ÷ 15625.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270, 15625/25=625.

So 270/625.

270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

Wait, 625 * 0.432 is 270. So yes, 0.432.

So the ratio is approximately 0.432. So system_1's total mass is about 0.432 times system_2's.

Wait, but the question is by what factor is system_1 MORE massive than system_2. So if M1 < M2, then system_1 is less massive. But wait, wait no:

Wait, the ratio is M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432, so system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

But the question asks by what factor system_1 is MORE massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.43, that means system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So it's about 0.43 times. So system_1 is less massive.

But the options are given as factors by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.43, then system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is 0.43, meaning it's about 0.43 times as massive. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the answer is approximately 0.4, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

M_ratio = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1 )

Compute 15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625.

3375 * 2 = 6750.

6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

Yes, 0.432. So approximately 0.43, which is about 0.4, so option A is ~0.4.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, when I wrote the formula, I assumed that the period is in seconds, but I didn't convert the velocities into m/s. Oh! Because in the formula, the units matter. Wait, but since I'm taking the ratio of two systems, the units would cancel out.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, the formula I derived:

M_total = ( G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π )

But G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, v in m/s, P in seconds.

So G has units m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

(v1 + v2) is in m/s, so (v1 + v2)^3 is m³/s³.

P is in seconds, so multiplying by P gives m³/s².

Wait, so:

G * (v1 + v2)^3 * P → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * m³/s³ * s → m^6 kg⁻¹ s⁻⁴.

Divide by 2 π (unitless):

M_total has units m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻⁴.

Wait, that can't be right because mass should be in kg. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.

Let me think again. Let's try to rederive the formula correctly.

In a binary system, the orbital period is P, the separation is a = a1 + a2, with a1 and a2 being the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass.

The center of mass condition: M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

The velocity of each star is v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So v1 = 2π (M2 a) / ( (M1+M2) P )

v2 = 2π (M1 a) / ( (M1+M2) P )

Adding the two velocities:

v1 + v2 = 2π a (M1 + M2) / ( (M1 + M2) P ) ) → 2π a / P.

So, a = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π )

So a = (v1 + v2) * (P/(2 π )).

Now, Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² G) (a³) / (M_total )

So M_total = (4 π² G a³ ) / P².

Substituting a from above:

M_total = (4 π² G ) [ ( (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) )^3 ] / P² )

= (4 π² G ) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) / P² )

= (4 π² G (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 P^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/8 = 1/2.

π² / π^3 = 1/π.

P^3 / P^2 = P.

So,

M_total = ( G (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 π )

Ah, so the same formula as before. So the units must be handled correctly.

But when taking the ratio between system_1 and system_2, the units would cancel out, so the ratio is correct.

So, M_ratio = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2 ) / 15625 → 6750 /15625 = 0.432.

So approximately 0.43, which is option A (~0.4) or option D (~0.7). Wait the options are:

A) ~ 0.4
B) ~ 0.6
C) ~ 1.2
D) ~ 0.7

So 0.43 is closest to option A, ~0.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system masses.

### Key Observations:
1. **System Parameters**:
   - **System_1**: Radial velocity amplitudes are \( v_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( v_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \), with an orbital period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \).
   - **System_2**: Radial velocity amplitudes are \( v_3 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( v_4 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), with an orbital period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \).

2. **Mass Ratio and Total Mass**:
   - The mass ratio of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to their radial velocity amplitudes:  
     \[
     \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{v_2}{v_1}, \quad \frac{M_3}{M_4} = \frac{v_4}{v_3}.
     \]
     For system_1:  
     \[
     \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_1 = 0.5 M_2.
     \]
     Total mass of system_1:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = 0.5 M_2 + M_2 = 1.5 M_2.
     \]
     For system_2:  
     \[
     \frac{M_3}{M_4} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_3 = \frac{2}{3} M_4.
     \]
     Total mass of system_2:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = M_3 + M_4 = \frac{2}{3} M_4 + M_4 = \frac{5}{3} M_4.
     \]

3. **Relating Total Mass to Velocities and Periods**:
   Using Kepler's third law and the relationship between radial velocities and orbital periods, the total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = \frac{G (v_1 + v_2)^3 P}{2 \pi}.
   \]
   Taking the ratio of the total masses of the two systems:  
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(v_1 + v_2)^3 P_1}{(v_3 + v_4)^3 P_2}.
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - For system_1: \( v_1 + v_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \).
   - For system_2: \( v_3 + v_4 = 15 + 10 = 25 \, \text{km/s} \), \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \).
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}.
   \]
   Compute the terms:  
   \[
   15^3 = 3375, \quad 25^3 = 15625, \quad \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The total mass of system_1 is approximately \( 0.432 \) times the total mass of system_2. Thus, system_1 is about \( 0.4 \) times as massive as system_2.
