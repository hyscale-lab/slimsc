Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, let's see what I remember about particle physics and decay processes. I think when a particle is at rest and decays, energy and momentum have to be conserved. So, the total energy before decay should equal the total energy after.

Wait, the pion is a meson, right? And it's decaying into a muon and a neutrino. Oh yeah, in reactions like this, the neutrino is a lepton, so it's very light. But I'm not sure if I can consider the neutrino's mass negligible compared to the other particles. For muon, the rest mass is given, but neutrino's mass is probably much smaller, so maybe we can approximate it as zero. That might make calculations easier.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is probably negligible, so I'll treat it as zero. So, the total rest mass before decay is just the pion's mass, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is near zero.

Wait, but the total energy after decay should equal the total energy before. So the energy before is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon is a massive particle, so its energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The neutrino is (probably) massless, so its energy is just its kinetic energy.

So, energy conservation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_initial is 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.

E_nu = K_nu.

So, 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

But what about momentum? Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

The magnitude of the momenta should be the same. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Now, for the muon, which has mass, its momentum can be found using the relativistic equation. The relation between energy and momentum for a particle is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So for the muon, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.

Similarly, for the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c.

But p_nu = p_mu, so E_nu ≈ p_mu c.

Wait, but let me write all the equations out.

Equation 1: Energy conservation: 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Equation 2: From the muon's energy: E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Equation 3: Neutrino's energy: E_nu = p c.

Also, the kinetic energy of the muon is K_mu = E_mu - 105.7.

So, let me try substituting some variables.

Let me let K_mu = K_m and K_nu = K_n.

So equation 1 becomes:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_m + K_n.

Which simplifies to:

K_m + K_n = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

That's one equation.

Now, the other equations involve momentum and energy.

From the muon, E_mu = 105.7 + K_m.

But E_mu^2 = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2.

And E_nu = p c.

So, E_nu = p c = K_n (since E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is K_nu, because its rest mass is zero).

Wait, no, wait. The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic, because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

So E_nu = K_n. So, p c = K_n.

Putting that into the muon equation:

E_mu^2 = (K_n)^2 + (105.7)^2.

But E_mu is also 105.7 + K_m.

So, (105.7 + K_m)^2 = (K_n)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

(105.7)^2 + 2 * 105.7 * K_m + (K_m)^2 = (K_n)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Subtract (105.7)^2 from both sides:

2 * 105.7 * K_m + (K_m)^2 = (K_n)^2.

But from equation 1, K_n = 33.9 - K_m.

So, substitute K_n = 33.9 - K_m into the equation.

So,

2 * 105.7 * K_m + (K_m)^2 = (33.9 - K_m)^2.

Let me compute the right-hand side: (33.9 - K_m)^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2 *33.9 * K_m + (K_m)^2.

So, substituting into the equation:

Left side: 211.4 * K_m + (K_m)^2.

Right side: 1149.21 - 67.8 * K_m + (K_m)^2.

Subtracting the right side from both sides:

211.4 K_m + K_m^2 - [1149.21 - 67.8 K_m + K_m^2] = 0.

Simplify:

211.4 K_m - 1149.21 + 67.8 K_m = 0.

Combine like terms:

(211.4 + 67.8) K_m = 1149.21.

279.2 K_m = 1149.21.

So K_m = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me compute 1149.21 / 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. Subtract from 1149.21: 32.41 left.

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So, approximately 4.116 MeV.

Wait, so K_m ≈4.116 MeV.

And then K_n = 33.9 -4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

279.2 *4 =1116.8

1149.21 -1116.8 = 32.41.

32.41 /279.2 = 0.116.

So total K_m is 4.116 MeV.

So K_mu is about 4.12 MeV, and K_nu is 33.9 -4.12 =29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.

Another approach: Let me define variables.

Let p be the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (same as neutrino, since pion is at rest).

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = 105.7 + K_mu.

E_nu = p c = K_nu.

Total energy: 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

So, K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu.

But E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = 105.7 + K_mu.

So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Substitute K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu:

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

105.7² + 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = (33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²) + 105.7².

Subtract 105.7² from both sides:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = 33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu².

Subtract K_mu²:

2*105.7*K_mu = 33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu.

Bring all terms to left:

2*105.7*K_mu + 2*33.9*K_mu - 33.9² = 0.

Factor:

2*K_mu*(105.7 +33.9) = 33.9².

So,

2 * K_mu * (139.6) )= 33.9².

Compute 33.9 squared: 33.9 *33.9.

33^2 = 1089, 0.9^2=0.81, cross terms 2*33*0.9=59.4.

So (33 + 0.9)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.9 +0.9²= 1089 +59.4 +0.81= 1149.21.

So,

2 * K_mu * 139.6 = 1149.21.

So,

K_mu = 1149.21 / (2 *139.6 ) = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute that: 1149.21 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 *4 = 1116.8.

1149.21 - 1116.8 =32.41.

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So 4.116 MeV. So K_mu ≈4.12 MeV.

Then K_nu =33.9 -4.12 =29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass of \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), while the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be equal:  
   \[
   139.6 = (105.7 + K_\mu) + K_\nu
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   K_\mu + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_\mu^2 = (p_\mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2.
   \]  
   For the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu c = K_\nu.
   \]

### Solving for \(K_\mu\) and \(K_\nu\)
From energy conservation, \(K_\nu = 33.9 - K_\mu\). Substituting into the muon's energy equation:  
\[
(105.7 + K_\mu)^2 = (33.9 - K_\mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2.
\]  
Canceling \(K_\mu^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu + 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu = 33.9^2.
\]  
\[
K_\mu \cdot (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]  
\[
K_\mu \cdot 279.2 = 1149.21.
\]  
\[
K_\mu = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Then, \(K_\nu = 33.9 - K_\mu \approx 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

So, energy conservation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_initial is 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.

E_nu = K_nu.

So, 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Equation 2: From the muon's energy: E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Equation 3: Neutrino's energy: E_nu = p c.

Also, the kinetic energy of the muon is K_mu = E_mu - 105.7.

So, let me try substituting some variables.

Let me let K_mu = K_m and K_nu = K_n.

So equation 1 becomes:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_m + K_n.

Which simplifies to:

K_m + K_n = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

That's one equation.

Now, the other equations involve momentum and energy.

From the muon, E_mu = 105.7 + K_m.

But E_mu^2 = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2.

And E_nu = p c.

So, E_nu = p c = K_n (since E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is K_nu, because its rest mass is zero).

Wait, no, wait. The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic, because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

So E_nu = K_n. So, p c = K_n.

Putting that into the muon equation:

E_mu^2 = (K_n)^2 + (105.7)^2.

But E_mu is also 105.7 + K_m.

So, (105.7 + K_m)^2 = (K_n)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

(105.7)^2 + 2 * 105.7 * K_m + (K_m)^2 = (K_n)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Subtract (105.7)^2 from both sides:

2 * 105.7 * K_m + (K_m)^2 = (K_n)^2.

But from equation 1, K_n = 33.9 - K_m.

So, substitute K_n = 33.9 - K_m into the equation.

So,

2 * 105.7 * K_m + (K_m)^2 = (33.9 - K_m)^2.

Let me compute the right-hand side: (33.9 - K_m)^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2 *33.9 * K_m + (K_m)^2.

So, substituting into the equation:

Left side: 211.4 * K_m + (K_m)^2.

Right side: 1149.21 - 67.8 * K_m + (K_m)^2.

Subtracting the right side from both sides:

211.4 K_m + K_m^2 - [1149.21 - 67.8 K_m + K_m^2] = 0.

Simplify:

211.4 K_m - 1149.21 + 67.8 K_m = 0.

Combine like terms:

(211.4 + 67.8) K_m = 1149.21.

279.2 K_m = 1149.21.

So K_m = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me compute 1149.21 / 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. Subtract from 1149.21: 32.41 left.

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So, approximately 4.116 MeV.

Wait, so K_m ≈4.116 MeV.

And then K_n = 33.9 -4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

279.2 *4 =1116.8

1149.21 -1116.8 = 32.41.

32.41 /279.2 = 0.116.

So total K_m is 4.116 MeV.

So K_mu is about 4.12 MeV, and K_nu is 33.9 -4.12 =29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.

Let p be the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (same as neutrino, since pion is at rest).

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = 105.7 + K_mu.

E_nu = p c = K_nu.

Total energy: 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

So, K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu.

But E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = 105.7 + K_mu.

So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Substitute K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu:

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

105.7² + 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = (33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²) + 105.7².

Subtract 105.7² from both sides:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = 33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu².

Subtract K_mu²:

2*105.7*K_mu = 33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu.

Bring all terms to left:

2*105.7*K_mu + 2*33.9*K_mu - 33.9² = 0.

Factor:

2*K_mu*(105.7 +33.9) = 33.9².

So,

2 * K_mu * (139.6) )= 33.9².

Compute 33.9 squared: 33.9 *33.9.

33^2 = 1089, 0.9^2=0.81, cross terms 2*33*0.9=59.4.

So (33 + 0.9)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.9 +0.9²= 1089 +59.4 +0.81= 1149.21.

So,

2 * K_mu * 139.6 = 1149.21.

So,

K_mu = 1149.21 / (2 *139.6 ) = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute that: 1149.21 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 *4 = 1116.8.

1149.21 - 1116.8 =32.41.

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So 4.116 MeV. So K_mu ≈4.12 MeV.

Then K_nu =33.9 -4.12 =29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the answer should be D.

   The total energy before and after the decay must be equal:  
   \[
   139.6 = (105.7 + K_\mu) + K_\nu
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   K_\mu + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**

   \]  
   For the neutrino:

   E_\nu = p_\nu c = K_\nu.
   \]

### Solving for \(K_\mu\) and \(K_\nu\)
From energy conservation, \(K_\nu = 33.9 - K_\mu\). Substituting into the muon's energy equation:  
\[
(105.7 + K_\mu)^2 = (33.9 - K_\mu)^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu + K_\mu^2.
\]  
Canceling \(K_\mu^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_\mu + 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_\mu = 33.9^2.
\]  
\[
K_\mu \cdot (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]  
\[
K_\mu \cdot 279.2 = 1149.21.
\]  
\[
K_\mu = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Then, \(K_\nu = 33.9 - K_\mu \approx 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
