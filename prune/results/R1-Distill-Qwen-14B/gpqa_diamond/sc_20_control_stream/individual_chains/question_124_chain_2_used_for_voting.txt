Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about particles moving in a detector and whether they reach the inner walls based on their Lorentz factor. Hmm, I remember that Lorentz factor is gamma, right? And gamma is related to how much time dilation or length contraction there is in relativity.

The setup is that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So, the distance each particle has to travel to reach the wall is 30 meters. These particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of about 20 on average. But wait, the question says that on average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls when gamma is 20. Now, we need to find the gamma needed so that two-thirds of them reach the walls.

Wait, so when gamma increases, the particles can go further, right? Because gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so higher gamma means higher speed, closer to c. So a higher gamma would mean the particles can travel more distance in their own frame, but from our lab frame, they just move faster, so the time they take to reach the wall is less.

Wait, no. Wait, the time they take to reach the wall in the lab frame depends on their speed. So if a particle has a higher gamma, which means higher velocity, it will take less time to reach the wall. But how does that affect whether they decay before reaching the wall?

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper time of the particles. Because particles that decay quickly might not reach the detector walls if they don't live long enough. So the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So if the particle's proper lifetime is tau, then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. But velocity is very close to c, so we can approximate t ≈ (distance)/(c). Wait, but since they are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so t ≈ R/(c), where R is the radius of the detector.

So for each particle, the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(c). But the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So for the particle to reach the wall before decaying, the lab frame lifetime needs to be longer than t. So the condition is:

gamma * tau > t.

But t is R/(c), so substituting:

gamma * tau > R/(c)

So tau must be > R/(c * gamma)

But wait, the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much their lifetime (in lab frame) is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. So, the probability of a particle reaching the wall is the fraction where gamma * tau >= t. But in reality, particles have a distribution of lifetimes, so perhaps a certain fraction will have lifetimes longer than t, hence reach the wall.

In the given problem, at gamma=20, one third reach the wall. So the fraction is 1/3. So what is the relation between gamma and the fraction that reach the wall?

Wait, let's think about it. The time in the lab frame is t = R/(c). The particle's lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau. So the particle will reach the wall if tau_lab >= t => gamma * tau >= R/(c).

Wait, but the probability is based on the distribution of tau. Suppose the proper lifetime tau is exponentially distributed, like in radioactive decay. The probability that tau <= t_dec is given by 1 - exp(-t_dec/tau_0), where tau_0 is the mean lifetime. Hmm, but in this case, we're looking for the probability that tau <= (R/(c * gamma)), because if tau <= (R/(c * gamma)), then gamma tau <= R/(c), which would mean the particle doesn't reach the wall. So the probability of NOT reaching the wall is the probability that tau <= (R/(c gamma)), which is 1 - exp(-(R/(c gamma))/tau_0).

Alternatively, perhaps it's a decay probability. The particles decay with a certain probability before reaching the wall. So the number of particles that reach the wall is proportional to the exponential of -(R/(c gamma tau)).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's try again. The decay probability is exp(-t/tau_0), where t is the time. So the time in the lab frame is t = R/(c v), but for ultra-relativistic particles, v≈c, so t ≈ R/(c^2) * c = R/(c) * (1/c) ? Wait, no. Wait, velocity is in meters per second. The time is distance divided by velocity. So for R=30 m, and v≈c=3e8 m/s, t ≈ 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

So t ≈ 1e-7 seconds. Now, the proper lifetime is tau, so the lab lifetime is gamma * tau. The particle will reach the wall if gamma * tau > t. So the condition is gamma > t/(tau) = (R/(c)) / tau.

But the fraction of particles that survive (reach the wall) is given by the survival probability, which is exp(-t/(tau_lab)) = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. The decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime. Wait, actually, if the lifetime is tau (proper time), then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time experienced by the particle is tau_particle = tau (since it's proper time). The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau. So the time available for the particle to decay is t = R/(v), which is approximately R/(c) for v ≈ c.

So the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is P_decay = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it reaches the wall is P_survive = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the given problem, when gamma = 20, P_survive = 1/3.

So, 1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -t/(20 tau)

So ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau)

Which implies t/(20 tau) = ln(3)

So t = 20 tau * ln(3)

But wait, wait. Let me re-examine. Let me write:

P_survive = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )

So, given P_survive = 1/3 when gamma = 20:

1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = t/(20 tau)

So t = 20 tau * ln(3)

But t is R/(c), right? Because t = R/(c) when v ≈ c.

So R/(c) = 20 tau * ln(3)

Now, we need to find the gamma (let's call it gamma_new) where P_survive = 2/3.

So:

2/3 = exp( - t/(gamma_new tau) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau)

Multiply by -1:

ln(3/2) = t/(gamma_new tau )

But from earlier, t = 20 tau ln(3)

Substituting:

ln(3/2) = (20 tau ln(3)) / (gamma_new tau )

The tau cancels:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma_new

So solve for gamma_new:

gamma_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2)

Hmm, let's compute the numerical values.

We know that:

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So gamma_new ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055

Let me compute that:

20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972

21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.15.

So gamma is approximately 54.15. Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check the math because maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the initial condition is that when gamma is 20, one third survive. So P_survive = 1/3. So equation is 1/3 = exp(- t/(20 tau)).

Which gives t/(20 tau) = ln(3). So t=20 tau ln(3).

Then, for the second case, P_survive is 2/3.

So 2/3 = exp( -t/(gamma_new tau) )

Taking natural logs:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = t/(gamma_new tau )

We have t = 20 tau ln(3)

Substitute into equation:

ln(3/2) = (20 tau ln(3)) / (gamma_new tau )

Tau cancels:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma_new

So gamma_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2)

Compute this:

ln(3) ≈ 1.098612

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.405465

So,

gamma_new = (20 * 1.098612) / 0.405465 ≈ (21.97224) / 0.405465 ≈ 54.15.

So approximately 54.15. So the closest option is A)54.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 68, which is higher. The initial gamma is 20, and to get a higher survival rate (two-thirds instead of one-third), we need a higher gamma because higher gamma means longer lifetime in lab frame, so more particles survive to reach the wall.

Wait, wait no. Wait, no, wait, no. Let me think: when gamma increases, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (gamma * tau) increases. So the time available for decay is t = R/(c) = 30 m / speed, but since speed is near c, t is about 1e-7 s as before.

So if gamma is higher, the lab frame lifetime is longer, so the probability of surviving (reaching the wall) increases. So to get from 1/3 to 2/3 survival, we need higher gamma.

So the calculation above gives gamma_new ≈54, which is higher than 20. So that makes sense.

So the correct answer would be option A)54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, particle lifetime, and the time it takes for particles to travel to the detector walls.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Time to Reach the Wall**:  
   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector walls in the lab frame is approximately:  
   \[
   t = \frac{R}{c}
   \]  
   where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the detector and \( c \) is the speed of light.

2. **Particle Lifetime in the Lab Frame**:  
   The lifetime of a particle in the lab frame is given by:  
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau
   \]  
   where \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

3. **Condition for Reaching the Wall**:  
   A particle reaches the wall if its lab frame lifetime is greater than the time it takes to travel to the wall:  
   \[
   \gamma \tau > t
   \]  
   The probability of a particle reaching the wall is proportional to the survival probability, which is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{survive}} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right)
   \]

4. **Given Information**:  
   - At \( \gamma = 20 \), \( P_{\text{survive}} = \frac{1}{3} \).  
   - We need to find \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \) such that \( P_{\text{survive}} = \frac{2}{3} \).

5. **Solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \)**:  
   Using the survival probability formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{20 \tau}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   t = 20 \tau \ln(3)
   \]  

   For \( P_{\text{survive}} = \frac{2}{3} \):  
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}
   \]  
   Substituting \( t = 20 \tau \ln(3) \):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_{\text{new}}}
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):  
   \[
   \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
   \]  

6. **Numerical Calculation**:  
   Using \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):  
   \[
   \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.15
   \]  

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for approximately two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is closest to **54**.
