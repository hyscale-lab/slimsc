Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the question.

First, the question is about two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Part B is about which of the two other compounds shows optical isomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in a shift of double bonds or lone pairs. This usually happens in molecules that have adjacent double bonds or in systems where a hydrogen can shift between atoms, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone—what's that? Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, it's like o-quinone. Wait, but does it have adjacent carbonyl groups that could allow for tautomerism? Wait, no, because for tautomerism you usually need something like a carbonyl group adjacent to an -NH group or another carbonyl with an alpha hydrogen. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the ring, but are they adjacent? Well, benzoquinone can be 1,2-diketone (ortho) or 1,4-diketone (para). In either case, if the two carbonyls are adjacent, maybe tautomerism is possible. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the structure is something like O=C6H4O, so the carbonyls are on adjacent carbons. So, does that allow for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism requires that a hydrogen be alpha to a carbonyl. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. Each carbon is attached to two carbons from the ring. So, the carbonyl carbons are each connected to two ring carbons, so they don't have any hydrogens. So, no alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, can tautomerism occur? Because tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha position to the carbonyl. Without alpha H, no keto-enol tautomerism. So, benzoquinone shouldn't show tautomerism. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Are there any other types of tautomerism? Like in allenes or something else? Hmm, I think benzoquinone doesn't have the necessary H's for keto-enol tautomerism. So, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups, I think. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-? No, wait, that's not right. If it's 1,3,5-trione, then the carbonyl groups are at every other carbon. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2 in a ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, those CH2 groups are adjacent to the carbonyls. That means each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens. So, each of those carbons adjacent to the carbonyl has two H's. So, can this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with alpha hydrogens. So, it might be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, with three carbonyls, does that allow for any tautomerism? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the molecule can lose a water molecule or not. No, tautomerism is a kind of isomerism where a hydrogen moves, like between a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. But in this case, each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, perhaps the H's can shift, causing a change in the structure.

Wait, but for tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl that can move to a neighboring oxygen, creating a double bond. For example, in a compound like cyclohexanone, which doesn't have alpha H, but if it's something like acetone, which does have alpha H, it can tautomerize. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with two alpha H's. So, perhaps it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, tautomerism generally requires a conjugated system where the H can move. So, if the molecule has conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe it can support tautomerism.

Wait, but does having multiple carbonyl groups in a row allow for tautomerism? For example, something like 1,3,5-trione would have three ketones on a ring. So, each has alpha H. So, perhaps it can form enol tautomers. So, the rings would have H's that can move. So, the compound would show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone doesn't have alpha H on the carbonyl carbons, so it doesn't tautomerize. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha H, so it can tautomerize. Therefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, for part A, the correct answer is A = benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says, which one does NOT show tautomerism. So, if A is the one that doesn't, then part A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

What's optical isomerism? It's when a compound has stereoisomerism, specifically due to chiral centers or geometric isomerism. Wait, but in the context of the question, it's about whether the compounds can have enantiomers or diastereomers.

Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is: the carboxylic acid is CH2(COOH)CH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with OCH3. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let's see: the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (from CH2?), wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the middle CH. Wait, the structure is more like:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH(OH). So, the groups attached are:

- CH3 (from CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: the molecule is propanoate, which is a three-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, perhaps the molecule is:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid has three carbons: carboxylic acid group on C1, then C2, then C3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have a hydroxyl on C2. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it becomes an ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

The middle carbon (C2) has the following groups: two CH2 groups (wait no, the C2 is connected to C1 (CH2(OH)), C3 (CH2COOCH3?), wait no. Let me draw it:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (from the ester)
Carbon 2: OH, and connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.
Wait, no: Carbon 1 is the COOCH3, Carbon 2 is the OH-bearing carbon. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me number the carbons: for propanoate, the COOCH3 is on C1. Then C2 has the OH, and C3 is CH3.

So, the structure is: C1 (COOCH3) — C2 (OH) — C3 (CH3). So, the central carbon (C2) has four substituents: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and the other CH2? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (COOCH3), C3 (CH3), and two hydrogens? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the middle CH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and one hydrogen.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups, meaning it's a chiral center. So, this molecule has a chiral center and hence can exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomerism). So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. So, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH. When it becomes fumarate, both -OH groups are replaced with OMe groups. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumarate is the cis isomer of the di-ester of maleic acid. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH-COOH, which is a trans configuration. Wait, no, no. Wait, maleic acid and fumaric acid: wait, maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric acid is the trans diacid. So, fumarate would be the ester of fumaric acid.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate would have a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no. Let's think: fumaric acid is trans-diaqua, so the two carboxylic groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, the structure would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is actually (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is trans. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have a geometric (E) isomerism.

Wait, but can dimethyl fumarate have optical isomerism? Alternatively, does it have geometric isomerism?

Wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it will show optical isomerism. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait, the structure is actually:

The molecule is (Z) or (E) isomer? Wait, no, since fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is trans (E). So, dimethyl fumarate is also E. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, looking for chiral centers. Each of the carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. Let me think, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH2-C=CH2
   | O
   O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3  C=C   O-C-OCH3
           ||
           O

Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on both ends of a double bond. So, the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are opposite each other. So, each of the carbons in the double bond has two groups: one CH2 group (from one side) and two COOCH3 groups on the other.

Wait, let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. For dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group attached. So, each carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3
- another CH2 group (which is connected to the other end of the double bond)
- and two H's?

Wait, no. The structure is CH2-CH2? No, wait, the double bond is between two carbons, each connected to two ester groups. No, wait, maybe it's CH2(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is trans. So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, but butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid has a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, butenedioic acid would be HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration. So, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group (but wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, each attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond in between. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with the double bond. So, the molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible as the double bond would require each carbon to have two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CO OMe)2. So, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. Wait, no, because that wouldn't be fumarate. Alternatively, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should just think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. So, in the structure, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups. Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each of the double bond carbons is attached to two identical groups? No, each is attached to two COOCH3 and two H's? Or maybe each double bond carbon is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group (if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond). No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group, but that would imply a structure like CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond, but that would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, which would have the structure where each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But wait, that would mean each double bond carbon has two different substituents, but no, each has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Because in the E configuration, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups, making the molecule achiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, so it's not chiral. For example, if the structure is symmetric, then it won't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, on the other hand, only has geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism because it lacks a chiral center. So, the answer to part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Let's imagine the E isomer: the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. The structure would be something like:

COOCH3
|
C= C
|
COOCH3

But with each C in the double bond attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. Wait, no, that can't be right because each C in the double bond can only have three bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond. So, each CH2 is connected to a COOCH3 and the other CH2. But wait, that's not possible because each CH2 would need four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a CH2 and two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, that would make each carbon have three substituents, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3  C=C  O-C-OCH3
           ||

So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, looking at this structure, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups (like another CH2 or something else). Wait, no, the carbons in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each is CH2(COOCH3)2, but connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond in between, making it CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible because each CH2 would have four bonds.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of whether the molecule has a chiral center. Since dimethyl fumarate has a symmetrical structure (E configuration), then it's not chiral. So, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. It can, however, exhibit geometric isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question is part B: which of the two (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) will show optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate → cannot show optical isomerism.

So, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the possibility of the fumarate being a diastereomer or something else? No, because optical isomerism is about enantiomers, which requires a chiral center. So, if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can't have enantiomers.

Therefore, putting it all together:

A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is benzoquinone and B is dimethyl fumarate. So, that's not correct because B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but the first part says A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, if A is benzoquinone (correct for part A), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for part B), then the correct option is option B.

So, looking at the options:

Option B is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves between atoms, typically involving adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups or alpha hydrogens. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. However, the carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the aromatic ring and lack alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each with alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to its trans configuration, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the question.

First, the question is about two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Part B is about which of the two other compounds shows optical isomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in a shift of double bonds or lone pairs. This usually happens in molecules that have adjacent double bonds or in systems where a hydrogen can shift between atoms, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone—what's that? Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, it's like o-quinone. Wait, but does it have adjacent carbonyl groups that could allow for tautomerism? Wait, no, because for tautomerism you usually need something like a carbonyl group adjacent to an -NH group or another carbonyl with an alpha hydrogen. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the ring, but are they adjacent? Well, benzoquinone can be 1,2-diketone (ortho) or 1,4-diketone (para). In either case, if the two carbonyls are adjacent, maybe tautomerism is possible. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the structure is something like O=C6H4O, so the carbonyls are on adjacent carbons. So, does that allow for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism requires that a hydrogen be alpha to a carbonyl. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. Each carbon is attached to two carbons from the ring. So, the carbonyl carbons are each connected to two ring carbons, so they don't have any hydrogens. So, no alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, can tautomerism occur? Because tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha position to the carbonyl. Without alpha H, no keto-enol tautomerism. So, benzoquinone shouldn't show tautomerism. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Are there any other types of tautomerism? Like in allenes or something else? Hmm, I think benzoquinone doesn't have the necessary H's for keto-enol tautomerism. So, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups, I think. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-? No, wait, that's not right. If it's 1,3,5-trione, then the carbonyl groups are at every other carbon. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2 in a ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, those CH2 groups are adjacent to the carbonyls. That means each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens. So, each of those carbons adjacent to the carbonyl has two H's. So, can this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with alpha hydrogens. So, it might be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, with three carbonyls, does that allow for any tautomerism? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the molecule can lose a water molecule or not. No, tautomerism is a kind of isomerism where a hydrogen moves, like between a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. But in this case, each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, perhaps the H's can shift, causing a change in the structure.

Wait, but for tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl that can move to a neighboring oxygen, creating a double bond. For example, in a compound like cyclohexanone, which doesn't have alpha H, but if it's something like acetone, which does have alpha H, it can tautomerize. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with two alpha H's. So, perhaps it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, tautomerism generally requires a conjugated system where the H can move. So, if the molecule has conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe it can support tautomerism.

Wait, but does having multiple carbonyl groups in a row allow for tautomerism? For example, something like 1,3,5-trione would have three ketones on a ring. So, each has alpha H. So, perhaps it can form enol tautomers. So, the rings would have H's that can move. So, the compound would show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone doesn't have alpha H on the carbonyl carbons, so it doesn't tautomerize. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha H, so it can tautomerize. Therefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, for part A, the correct answer is A = benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says, which one does NOT show tautomerism. So, if A is the one that doesn't, then part A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

What's optical isomerism? It's when a compound has stereoisomerism, specifically due to chiral centers or geometric isomerism. Wait, but in the context of the question, it's about whether the compounds can have enantiomers or diastereomers.

Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is: the carboxylic acid is CH2(COOH)CH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with OCH3. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let's see: the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (from CH2?), wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the middle CH. Wait, the structure is more like:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH(OH). So, the groups attached are:

- CH3 (from CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: the molecule is propanoate, which is a three-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, perhaps the molecule is:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid has three carbons: carboxylic acid group on C1, then C2, then C3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have a hydroxyl on C2. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it becomes an ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

The middle carbon (C2) has the following groups: two CH2 groups (wait no, the C2 is connected to C1 (CH2(OH)), C3 (CH2COOCH3?), wait no. Let me draw it:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (from the ester)
Carbon 2: OH, and connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.
Wait, no: Carbon 1 is the COOCH3, Carbon 2 is the OH-bearing carbon. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me number the carbons: for propanoate, the COOCH3 is on C1. Then C2 has the OH, and C3 is CH3.

So, the structure is: C1 (COOCH3) — C2 (OH) — C3 (CH3). So, the central carbon (C2) has four substituents: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and the other CH2? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (COOCH3), C3 (CH3), and two hydrogens? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the middle CH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and one hydrogen.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups, meaning it's a chiral center. So, this molecule has a chiral center and hence can exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomerism). So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. So, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH. When it becomes fumarate, both -OH groups are replaced with OMe groups. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumarate is the cis isomer of the di-ester of maleic acid. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH-COOH, which is a trans configuration. Wait, no, no. Wait, maleic acid and fumaric acid: wait, maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric acid is the trans diacid. So, fumarate would be the ester of fumaric acid.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate would have a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no. Let's think: fumaric acid is trans-diaqua, so the two carboxylic groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, the structure would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is actually (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is trans. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have a geometric (E) isomerism.

Wait, but can dimethyl fumarate have optical isomerism? Alternatively, does it have geometric isomerism?

Wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it will show optical isomerism. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait, the structure is actually:

The molecule is (Z) or (E) isomer? Wait, no, since fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is trans (E). So, dimethyl fumarate is also E. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, looking for chiral centers. Each of the carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. Let me think, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH2-C=CH2
   | O
   O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3  C=C   O-C-OCH3
           ||
           O

Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on both ends of a double bond. So, the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are opposite each other. So, each of the carbons in the double bond has two groups: one CH2 group (from one side) and two COOCH3 groups on the other.

Wait, let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. For dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group attached. So, each carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3
- another CH2 group (which is connected to the other end of the double bond)
- and two H's?

Wait, no. The structure is CH2-CH2? No, wait, the double bond is between two carbons, each connected to two ester groups. No, wait, maybe it's CH2(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is trans. So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, but butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid has a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, butenedioic acid would be HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration. So, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group (but wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, each attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond in between. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with the double bond. So, the molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible as the double bond would require each carbon to have two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CO OMe)2. So, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. Wait, no, because that wouldn't be fumarate. Alternatively, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should just think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. So, in the structure, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups. Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each of the double bond carbons is attached to two identical groups? No, each is attached to two COOCH3 and two H's? Or maybe each double bond carbon is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group (if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond). No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group, but that would imply a structure like CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond, but that would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, which would have the structure where each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But wait, that would mean each double bond carbon has two different substituents, but no, each has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Because in the E configuration, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups, making the molecule achiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, so it's not chiral. For example, if the structure is symmetric, then it won't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, on the other hand, only has geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism because it lacks a chiral center. So, the answer to part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Let's imagine the E isomer: the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. The structure would be something like:

COOCH3
|
C= C
|
COOCH3

But with each C in the double bond attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. Wait, no, that can't be right because each C in the double bond can only have three bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond. So, each CH2 is connected to a COOCH3 and the other CH2. But wait, that's not possible because each CH2 would need four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a CH2 and two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, that would make each carbon have three substituents, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3  C=C  O-C-OCH3
           ||

So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, looking at this structure, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups (like another CH2 or something else). Wait, no, the carbons in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each is CH2(COOCH3)2, but connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond in between, making it CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible because each CH2 would have four bonds.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of whether the molecule has a chiral center. Since dimethyl fumarate has a symmetrical structure (E configuration), then it's not chiral. So, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. It can, however, exhibit geometric isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question is part B: which of the two (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) will show optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate → cannot show optical isomerism.

So, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the possibility of the fumarate being a diastereomer or something else? No, because optical isomerism is about enantiomers, which requires a chiral center. So, if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can't have enantiomers.

Therefore, putting it all together:

A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is benzoquinone and B is dimethyl fumarate. So, that's not correct because B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but the first part says A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, if A is benzoquinone (correct for part A), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for part B), then the correct option is option B.

So, looking at the options:

Option B is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's correct.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves between atoms, typically involving adjacent carbonyl and hydroxyl groups or alpha hydrogens. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. However, the carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the aromatic ring and lack alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each with alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to its trans configuration, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

**Answer: B**
