Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. The question mentions that as the star rotates, the spots come into view and cause brightness variations, which could look like an exoplanet transit. But the twist is, the problem is asking: if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness dip, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Hmm. So I need to compare the light variation caused by the spots to that of a planet transit and find the planet's radius that would produce the same dip.

Wait, let me think about both scenarios.

First, the star with spots. When a spot is facing us, it's cooler, so it emits less light. The total observed brightness will drop because part of the star's surface is emitting less. The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

In the case of an exoplanet, when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So B = (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, the situation with the spots is a bit different. The spots are darker, so when they rotate into view, the total emitted light decreases. The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But with spots, the total luminosity is L = L_clean - L_spots + L_spot_area * T_spot⁴. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the average brightness change.

Wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variations are due to rotational modulation of the spots. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. The maximum effect is when the spots are fully visible. The change in brightness would be (L_spot_area * T_spot^4) / (L_total), perhaps? Or maybe it's the difference in brightness.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the star's brightness with spots as a combination of the unspotted area and the spotted area. The total flux would be the sum of the flux from each area.

Wait, the star is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere is covered with spots, the other isn't. So when the star rotates, only the spotted hemisphere comes into view. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the area. Wait, no, the star's surface is a sphere, so each face is a hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of (π R²), since a hemisphere is half of the sphere's surface area.

Wait, let me think again. The total surface area of the star is 4πR². Each hemisphere (like the front and back) is 2πR² each. So spots are covering 20% of one hemisphere. So area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But when the star rotates, we see either the spotted or the unspotted hemisphere. Wait no, the star is rotating, so the spots come into view in the same way as a planet would transit. Alternatively, when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is due to the change in the observed flux as the spots rotate into and out of view. However, in this problem, the star's light curve would dip when the spots are on the same side as us, but since the spots only cover part of the hemisphere, the dip isn't as big as a full planet blocking.

Wait, but the problem says the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when the star is observed edge-on, and the spots are on one side, the brightness dip when the spots rotate into view could mimic a planet transit.

But to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve, I need to calculate the relative change in brightness for both cases and set them equal.

So, the change in brightness when the planet transits is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the planet blocks that area.

For the star with spots, the change in brightness when the spots are visible is (fractional area of spots) * (difference in flux per unit area) compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the fractional dip in brightness for both scenarios.

Let me model it.

First, the star's total flux without any spots is F_total = σ Teff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π D^2) ) [but perhaps we can ignore the distance D as it's the same for both scenarios.]

Wait, perhaps in terms of flux per unit area, the star emits F = σ Teff^4. The unspotted area emits F = σ (6000)^4.

The spots are cooler, at 5000 K, so their flux per unit area is σ (5000)^4.

So, the area of the spots is A = 0.2 * (π R^2). Because the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere (which is π R² area).

When the spots are on the side facing us (i.e., when the star's spotted hemisphere is visible), the total flux is:

F_spotted = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted) + (Area_spots * F_spots)

The area_unspotted is the area of the hemisphere minus the spots: (π R²) - (0.2 π R²) ) = 0.8 π R².

So,

F_spotted = (0.8 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 π R²) * σ (5000)^4

The original flux without any spots (assuming no spots) would be when the entire hemisphere is at Teff. But wait, the star without any spots would have the entire surface at 6000 K, but in this case, the star with spots has a hemisphere at 6000K and another at 5000K with 20% coverage.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's overall effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are cooler. So if the star didn't have any spots, its flux would be 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when the star has spots, when one hemisphere is spotted, the flux is F = (π R²)(1 - 0.2) * σ (6000)^4 + (π R²)(0.2) * σ (5000)^4.

Because the unspotted part of the hemisphere is 80% of π R², and the spots are 20% of π R².

So the change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is: F_spotted - F_unspotted.

Wait, no. Wait, the original flux when the star isn't spotted is 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But when the star is spotted, when we're looking at the spotted hemisphere, the flux is:

F_spotted = (0.8 * π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The original flux (without any spots) would be when all areas emit at 6000 K. So when the spotted hemisphere is not visible (e.g., the other hemisphere is facing us), the flux is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, the hemisphere facing us is either the spotted or the unspotted one. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted, and when the unspotted is visible, the flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because if the star has two hemispheres, one of which is 20% spotted, and the other is 100% unspotted, then when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2π R² σ (6000)^4. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted.

But in the scenario without spots, the entire star is emitting at 6000 K. So the flux without any spots would be 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but the star with spots has two hemispheres: one where 20% is spots (T=5000), and 80% is unspotted (T=6000), and the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted (T=6000). So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (0.8 * π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * π R² * σ (5000)^4).

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted_hemi = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because the other hemisphere is unspotted, so its entire area (π R²) is emitting at 6000 K. So the total flux when that hemisphere is visible is (π R² * σ 6000^4) + (π R² * σ 6000^4) = 2 π R² σ 6000^4.

Wait, but the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = (0.8 π R² * 6000^4) + (0.2 π R² * 5000^4) = π R² (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4).

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is (0.8*6000^4 +0.2*5000^4) / (4 * 6000^4) of the total flux without any spots.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible compared to the unspotted.

Alternatively, to find the change in flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the brightness variation is due to the spots, so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the star is dimmer. The amplitude of this variation is the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when the unspotted is.

So the dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

ΔF = F_unspotted_case - F_spotted_case.

Wait, no. When the spotted side is visible, the flux is F_spotted, and when the other side is visible, it's F_unspotted. So the maximum dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, no. The flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted, and when the other hemisphere is visible, it's F_unspotted_hemi. So the difference is F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted.

Wait, but in reality, the star's total flux without any spots would be when both hemispheres are emitting full 6000 K. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted, and the other time it's F_unspotted_hemi.

Wait, perhaps the star's average flux with spots is the average of F_spotted and F_unspotted.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So the maximum dip is when F_spotted is lower than F_unspotted_hemi.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional dip.

So, the dip in brightness when the spots are visible is:

( F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted_hemi.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should compute the flux in both cases and find the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the total flux when the spots are on the side we see, and when they're on the other side.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. So the maximum dip occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the flux is lower. The other time, the flux is higher.

Wait, actually, no. Because the star's other hemisphere is unspotted, so when that side is facing us, the flux is higher (since all parts are at 6000 K). So the dip in brightness is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the flux when the spots are visible to the flux when they're not, and then find the fractional dip.

Alternatively, let's model the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and when it's not.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = (0.8 π R² * (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² * (5000)^4 ) / (4π R²) ) times the total flux without spots.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think in terms of the star's total flux.

The star's total flux without any spots is:

F_total_clean = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are present, and the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotted = [ (π R² - 0.2 π R²) * (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² * (5000)^4 ] * σ.

Which simplifies to:

F_spotted = [ 0.8 π R² (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² (5000)^4 ] σ.

When the other hemisphere is visible (the unspotted one), the flux is:

F_unspotted_hemi = π R² * (6000)^4 * σ + π R² * (6000)^4 * σ = 2 π R² (6000)^4 σ.

So the maximum dip occurs when the spotted side is visible, and the flux is F_spotted. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is visible, F_unspotted_hemi.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation (ΔF) would be F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted.

Wait, but when the star is not spotted, the flux would be 4 π R² σ (6000)^4. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2 π R² σ (6000)^4, which is half of the total, so that makes sense.

So the dip is:

ΔF = F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted.

Let me compute that.

F_unspotted_hemi = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = (0.8 π R² σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 π R² σ (5000)^4) ) = π R² σ [ 0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ].

So,

ΔF = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 - [ π R² σ (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ) ].

Factor out π R² σ:

ΔF = π R² σ [ 2*6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

2*6000^4 = 2*(6000^4)
0.8*6000^4 is 0.8*(6000^4)
0.2*5000^4 is 0.2*(5000^4)

So,

2*6000^4 - 0.8*6000^4 = (2 - 0.8) *6000^4 = 1.2 *6000^4.

Then subtract 0.2*5000^4:

So the bracket becomes 1.2*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4.

So ΔF = π R² σ [ 1.2*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ].

Wait, but the star's total flux when not spotted is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4. So the dip ΔF is the change from the unspotted case.

But I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should compute the fractional dip, which is (ΔF) / F_total_clean.

Wait, because the question is comparing the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet.

So let's compute both scenarios.

First, the spot scenario:

The maximum dip in flux when the spots are visible is ΔF_spot = F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted.

Which we've calculated as:

ΔF_spot = π R² σ [ 1.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

The total flux without any spots would be F_total_clean = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the fractional dip is (ΔF_spot) / F_total_clean.

Let me compute that fraction:

(ΔF_spot) / F_total_clean = [ π R² σ (1.2*(6e3)^4 - 0.2*(5e3)^4) ) ] / [4 π R² σ (6e3)^4 ) ]

Simplify: R² σ cancels out, π cancels, so:

= [ (1.2*6e3^4 - 0.2*5e3^4 ) ] / (4 * 6e3^4 )

Let me compute 6e3^4 and 5e3^4:

6e3^4 = (6000)^4 = (6 * 1e3 )^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5e3^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

1.2 *1.296e15 = 1.2 * 1.296e15 = let's compute 1.2 *1.296: 1.296 *1.2 = 1.5552e15.

0.2 *6.25e14 = 1.25e14.

So,

1.2*6e3^4 - 0.2*5e3^4 = 1.5552e15 - 1.25e14 = 1.5552e15 - 0.125e15 = 1.4302e15.

Denominator: 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So,

Fractional dip (ΔF_spot / F_total_clean) = 1.4302e15 / 5.184e15 ≈ 0.2758.

So about 27.58% dip? Wait, that seems very high. But given that a large portion of the star is cooler, maybe that's correct.

Wait, but wait. The amplitude of the variation due to the spots is this fractional dip, right? So when the spots are visible, the star is dimmer by ~27.6% of its total flux without spots.

But when the planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So the dip caused by the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2.

We need to set this equal to 0.2758, the fractional dip from the spots.

So,

(R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.2758.

Taking square root: R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.2758) ≈ 0.525.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have a 0.5 option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because the star's brightness variation when the spots are visible is not the dip relative to the full star (without any spots), but relative to the average brightness of the star with spots.

Wait, no, the question says that the scenario resembles an exoplanet. So to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, the planet's transit would cause the same dip as the spot-induced dip.

Wait, but in the spot case, the dimming is a dip of 27% of the total flux. But when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 of the star's flux. So if the planet's transit dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.2758, then R_p is 0.525 R_s, but that's not one of the options. So clearly, I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the setup. Let me think again.

The problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and that this can resemble an exoplanet transit. The question is: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should the planet's radius be.

Ah, wait! So perhaps the star without spots would have a certain flux. When the planet transits, it blocks some of that flux, causing a dip. The dip's amplitude is (R_p / R_s)^2.

But in the star with spots, the dip amplitude is (F_clean - F_spotted) / F_clean.

Wait, no. Because when the star is not covered by spots, its flux is F_clean. When the star is covered by spots and the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted.

So the dip is (F_clean - F_spotted) / F_clean.

Wait, but earlier I computed (ΔF_spot / F_clean) as about 27.58%. So if the planet's transit causes the same dip, then (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.2758 → R_p = 0.525 R_s. But that's not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's brightness when the spots are visible as the flux being F_spotted, and when the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted_hemi. So the average brightness is (F_spotted + F_unspotted_hemi)/2.

But the amplitude of the light curve is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

So the maximum brightness is F_unspotted_hemi, the minimum is F_spotted.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted) / F_avg, where F_avg is the average flux over the rotation period.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

So F_avg = (F_spotted + F_unspotted_hemi) / 2.

Then, amplitude A = (F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted) / F_avg.

Let me compute that.

F_unspotted_hemi = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4].

So,

F_avg = [2 π R² σ (6e3)^4 + π R² σ (0.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4) ] / 2.

Factor out π R² σ:

F_avg = [ π R² σ (2*(6e3)^4 + 0.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ) ] / 2.

Simplify the terms inside:

2*(6e3)^4 + 0.8*(6e3)^4 = (2 + 0.8) * (6e3)^4 = 2.8 * (6e3)^4.

So,

F_avg = [ π R² σ ( 2.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ) ] / 2.

= π R² σ [ (2.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ) ] / 2.

Now, amplitude A = (F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted) / F_avg.

Compute F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted:

= 2 π R² σ (6e3)^4 - π R² σ [ 0.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ]

= π R² σ [ 2*(6e3)^4 - 0.8*(6e3)^4 - 0.2*(5e3)^4 ]

= π R² σ [ (2 - 0.8) * (6e3)^4 - 0.2*(5e3)^4 ]

= π R² σ [ 1.2*(6e3)^4 - 0.2*(5e3)^4 ]

Which is the same as before. So,

A = [ π R² σ (1.2*(6e3)^4 - 0.2*(5e3)^4 ) ] / [ π R² σ (2.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ) / 2 ]

The π R² σ cancels out, so:

A = [ 1.2*(6e3)^4 - 0.2*(5e3)^4 ] * 2 / [ 2.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ]

Let me compute the numerator:

1.2*(6e3)^4 = 1.2 * 1.296e15 = 1.5552e15.

0.2*(5e3)^4 = 0.2 * 6.25e14 = 1.25e14.

So numerator:

1.5552e15 - 1.25e14 = 1.5552e15 - 0.125e15 = 1.4302e15.

Multiply by 2: 2.8604e15.

Denominator:

2.8*(6e3)^4 = 2.8 * 1.296e15 = 3.6288e15.

0.2*(5e3)^4 = 1.25e14.

So denominator sum: 3.6288e15 + 1.25e14 = 3.6288e15 + 0.125e15 = 3.7538e15.

So,

A = 2.8604e15 / 3.7538e15 ≈ 0.763.

Wait, that's a 76% amplitude, which would be a huge dip, but that can't be right. Because the planet's transit dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, and the options are around 0.07 to 0.39.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the star's brightness when the spots are visible. Let me think again.

The star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, but the spots are cooler. The star's overall luminosity without spots is F_clean = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when the spots are present, the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = (hemisphere area) times the average flux of that hemisphere.

Wait, each hemisphere is π R². The spotted hemisphere has 80% of its area at 6000 K and 20% at 5000 K.

So the average flux of the spotted hemisphere is:

F_hemi_spotted = [ 0.8 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * σ (5000)^4 ] * (π R²) / (π R²) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the flux per unit area for the spotted hemisphere is 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4).

So the total flux for the spotted hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemi = [0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)] * σ * π R².

The other hemisphere is unspotted, so it contributes:

F_unspotted_hemi = [ (6000^4) ] * σ * π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is F_spotted_hemi.

When the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted_hemi.

The star's average flux over rotation would be (F_spotted_hemi + F_unspotted_hemi)/2.

So the maximum dip is when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and the flux is F_spotted_hemi.

So the dip is F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemi, which is lower than F_unspotted_hemi.

So the dip is the difference between F_unspotted_hemi and F_spotted_hemi.

So dip ΔF = F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi.

Flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted_hemi.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi) / F_avg, where F_avg is (F_spotted_hemi + F_unspotted_hemi) / 2.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach.

So let's compute these:

F_unspotted_hemi = σ (6000)^4 * π R².

F_spotted_hemi = σ [ 0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ] * π R².

So,

ΔF = F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi = σ π R² [ (6000^4) - 0.8*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= σ π R² [ 0.2*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 σ π R² [6000^4 - 5000^4 ].

F_avg = (F_spotted_hemi + F_unspotted_hemi ) / 2.

= [ σ π R² (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4) + σ π R² (6000^4) ] / 2.

= σ π R² [0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 + 6000^4 ] / 2.

= σ π R² [ (0.8+1)*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ] / 2.

= σ π R² [ 1.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ] / 2.

So,

A = ΔF / F_avg = [0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ (1.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ) / 2 ]

= [0.2 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) * 2 ] / [ 1.8*(6e3^4) + 0.2*(5e3^4) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

Denominator: 1.8*(6e3^4) + 0.2*(5e3^4)

Let me compute the numbers.

Compute 6e3^4: (6000)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5e3^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

Numerator: 0.4*(1.296e15 - 6.25e14 ) = 0.4*(1.296e15 - 0.625e15 ) = 0.4*(0.671e15) ) = 0.2684e15.

Denominator: 1.8*1.296e15 + 0.2*6.25e14.

1.8 *1.296e15 = 2.3328e15.

0.2 *6.25e14 = 1.25e14 = 0.125e15.

Sum: 2.3328e15 +0.125e15 = 2.4578e15.

So,

A = 0.2684e15 / 2.4578e15 ≈ 0.1092.

So the amplitude is about 10.92%.

So when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2. We want this to equal 0.1092.

So,

(R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.1092 → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1092) ≈ 0.3305.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

Wait, but let's compute sqrt(0.1092).

0.33^2 = 0.1089, which is approximately 0.1092.

So R_p/R_s ≈ 0.33, which is option D (~0.32).

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the scenarios of both the spotted star and the planet transit.

### Key Analysis

1. **Star with Spots**:
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere with dark spots covering 20% of its area. The spots are cooler, with a temperature of \( 5000 \, \text{K} \).
   - The total flux from the star without spots is \( F_{\text{clean}} = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \left( 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 \right) \cdot \pi R^2 \sigma
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes:
     \[
     A = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{avg}}}
     \]
     where \( F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{F_{\text{spotted}} + F_{\text{unspotted}}}{2} \).

2. **Planet Transit**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, the planet's radius must satisfy:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = A
     \]

3. **Calculations**:
   - Compute the flux terms:
     \[
     (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15}, \quad (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14}
     \]
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \pi R^2 \sigma \left( 0.8 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15} + 0.2 \cdot 6.25 \times 10^{14} \right)
     \]
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = \pi R^2 \sigma \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}
     \]
   - The amplitude \( A \) is:
     \[
     A = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{avg}}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     A = \frac{0.2 \cdot (1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14})}{(1.8 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15} + 0.2 \cdot 6.25 \times 10^{14}) / 2}
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     A \approx 0.1092
     \]
   - For the planet transit, set \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1092 \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1092} \approx 0.33
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.33 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
