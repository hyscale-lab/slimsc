Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. Wait, cm³ is the same as mL, right? So that's 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here. 

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, I think. So I need to find [PO4^3-].

Hmm, I remember that in phosphate buffer solutions, the different forms of phosphate (like H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-) can interconvert based on the pH. Since we're dealing with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, these are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate ions, respectively. 

Wait, KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- (so it's the dihydrogen phosphate). Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate). So when they dissolve in water, they contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

But how does that relate to the concentration of PO4^3-? I'm a bit confused because PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So maybe the solution is acting as a buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or is it between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?

Wait, the phosphate ion HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3- and H+. But under what conditions? The presence of H+ ions would shift the equilibrium. 

The problem gives me the three dissociation constants for H3PO4:
Ka1 = 7.5e-3,
Ka2 = 6.2e-8,
Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, which dissociates stepwise. 

The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+; Ka1 is 7.5e-3.
The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+; Ka2 is 6.2e-8.
The third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+; Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, each step is much less acidic than the previous. The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, right? Because those are the two species present in significant amounts. 

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. But since the solution has HPO4^2-, some of it might deprotonate to PO4^3-. However, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would depend on the pH. 

But wait, the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me think about the solution. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

So this is a buffer solution because it has a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the base and the acid. 

But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the pH of the solution. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the different species present. Let me outline the species in solution:

- H2PO4^- from KH2PO4
- HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4
- K+ and Na+ from the salts (but these are spectator ions, so they don't affect the phosphate equilibria)
- Water, H+ and OH-.

The total phosphate species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this case, the solution doesn't have H3PO4 because it's starting from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution can't have much H3PO4 because we started with the salts. However, some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will dissociate further. So the concentrations of HPO4^2- and PO4^3- will be linked via the Ka3.

But since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations. Once I find the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation constant.

Alternatively, maybe I can model all the equilibria together but that might get complicated. Let's think step by step.

First, let me calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007337 moles. So around 0.007337 mol of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol. So about 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

The solution's volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L. So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.036685 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02809 M

Now, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])

Wait, which pKa? Because HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, which comes from the second dissociation. So pKa2 is the relevant one here.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let's compute that.

log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 = 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log([0.02809]/[0.036685])

Compute the ratio: 0.02809 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.114 ≈ 7.0936.

Wait, that's the pH of the solution.

Now, knowing the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- in solution. Because HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So the reaction is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M (from earlier), and [H+] is 10^-pH.

pH is approximately 7.0936, so [H+] = 1e-7.0936 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Putting it all together:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.21e-8

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.056e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial concentrations of HPO4^2- are 0.02809 M, but some of it dissociates into PO4^3-. So the actual [HPO4^2-] in the solution is less than 0.02809 M. But wait, in the buffer solution, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in a certain ratio, but how about the PO4^3-?

Ah, but in the buffer, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but a small amount of PO4^3- will be present due to the third dissociation. So the [PO4^3-] can be calculated based on the pH and the [HPO4^2-] concentration.

Wait, but if I use the [HPO4^2-] from the initial calculation, which is 0.02809 M, but in reality, the concentration is lower because some of it has dissociated. Hmm, but the dissociation is so small that the change might be negligible. Let me check.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very small compared to HPO4^2-.

So perhaps it's a valid approximation to take [HPO4^2-] as approximately 0.02809 M. Let's proceed with that.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.21e-8) ≈ (5.056e-14) / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close to my calculation. But wait, let me make more precise calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the pH accurately.

First, the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.02809 / 0.036685.

0.02809 divided by 0.036685: let's compute that precisely.

0.02809 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.7667.

log(0.7667) is approximately -0.114. Let me compute it more accurately. Log(0.7667) is log(7.667e-1) = log(7.667) + (-1) * log(10). Log(7.667) is about 0.885. So log(0.7667) ≈ 0.885 - 1 = -0.115.

So pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.87 ≈ 8.7e-8 M.

Now, let's compute [PO4^3-] again.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging the numbers in:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M

[H+] = 8.7e-8 M

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.7e-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 0.02809 * 1.8 = 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14

Divide by 8.7e-8: 5.0562e-14 / 8.7e-8 = (5.0562 / 8.7) * 1e-6.

5.0562 / 8.7 ≈ 0.581.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.581e-6 M = 5.81e-7 M.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Hmm, 5.81e-7 isn't exactly matching any option. But perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator again.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M from the Na2HPO4.

[H+] is 8.7e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.7e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 0.05056e-12 = 5.056e-14.

Denominator: 8.7e-8.

So 5.056e-14 /8.7e-8 = (5.056 /8.7) * 1e-6.

5.056 /8.7 = approximately 0.581.

So 0.581e-6 = 5.81e-7 M.

But the options don't have exactly this. So perhaps I need to be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH more accurately.

Let me do the pH calculation again.

The ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.036685 = approx 0.7667.

Take the log of 0.7667.

We can compute it more accurately. The log(0.7667) is:

We know that log(0.7) is ~-0.1549, log(0.75)= log(3/4)= log(3)-log(4)= 0.4771 - 0.6021= -0.125. Log(0.7667) is between these.

Using a calculator approach, or perhaps using a Taylor expansion.

Alternatively, I can compute it precisely:

Let me compute log(0.7667):

We know that ln(0.7667) is approximately ln(0.7667) ≈ -0.266.

Then, log(x) = ln(x)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.266)/2.3026 ≈ -0.1155.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.1155) = 7.2076 - 0.1155 = 7.0921.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0921) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0921) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0921).

What's 10^(-0.0921)?

We can compute 10^0.0921 is approx 1.236 (because log(1.236)≈0.091). So 10^(-0.0921)= 1/1.236≈0.809.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.809 = 8.09e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.09e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.09e-8.

So 5.0562e-14 / 8.09e-8 = (5.0562 /8.09) * 1e-6.

5.0562 ÷8.09 ≈ 0.625.

So 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.

Ah, that's approximately 6.25e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M). 

Wait, but why did the previous calculation give 5.8e-7 and now it's 6.2e-7? Because I used a more precise [H+] which is 8.09e-8.

So it's about 6.25e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but another point: Are the concentrations of HPO4^2- I used accurate? Because in the solution, some HPO4^2- may dissociate into PO4^3-, which would lower the [HPO4^2-]. But given that Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the change would be negligible. So the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact change. Let me see.

Let me denote x as [PO4^3-]. Then, since HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3- and H+, the change is x. So, the [HPO4^2-] becomes approximately 0.02809 - x, and [PO4^3-] is x, [H+] is known as 8.09e-8.

But since Ka3 is so small, x would be tiny compared to 0.02809, so 0.02809 - x ≈ 0.02809. So the approximation holds, and the change is negligible.

Therefore, the calculation using [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M is correct.

Thus, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.25e-7 M, which aligns with option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄), which act as a buffer between the second and third dissociation steps of H₃PO₄. The relevant dissociation constant is Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹², which governs the equilibrium between HPO₄²⁻ and PO₄³⁻:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \)
- Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L

\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007337 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the relevant pKa being pKa₂ of H₃PO₄. Given Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, we calculate:

\[
\text{pKa₂} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa₂} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]

Substitute the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log\left(\frac{0.02809}{0.036685}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{0.02809}{0.036685} \approx 0.766, \quad \log(0.766) \approx -0.114
\]

\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.2076 - 0.114 = 7.0936
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The equilibrium expression for the third dissociation is:

\[
\text{Ka₃} = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka₃} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0936} \approx 8.09 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds closely to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

Answer: A
