Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Mott-Gurney equation. I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let me think this through.

The question is about the validity conditions of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). I remember that this equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when it's operating in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. 

So, the Mott-Gurney equation applies to cases where the current is limited by the space charge, meaning that the charge carriers are being depleted from the bulk, creating a space charge region that affects the electric field. This is different from other current regimes like ohmic or field-effect.

Now, the options are about the conditions under which this equation holds. Let's look at each option.

Option A: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Hmm. Ohmic contact implies that the contact doesn't create a barrier for carriers. Trap-free probably means that there are no defects or states that can trap electrons, so carrier recombination or trapping isn't an issue. But what about drift vs. diffusion? In the SCLC regime, I think the current is primarily due to the electric field, so drift is significant. But wait, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is space-charge limited, implying that the carriers are moving under the influence of the built-up field. So if there's negligible drift, that might not fit. Or wait, the SCLC is when the space charge itself creates the electric field, which leads to velocity saturation. So in that case, drift is important, not diffusion. So if this option says negligible drift current, that might not be correct. Because in SCLC, drift is significant.

Option B: Valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean Ohmic contact perhaps. If there's no barrier, carriers can move freely. The equation is for when the current is due to space charge, so perhaps when the injection is efficient, which an Ohmic contact would allow. Also, negligible diffusion current: I think that in the SCLC regime, the current is mainly due to drift, not diffusion. Because diffusion is about concentration gradients, and in SCLC, the space charge creates an electric field that drives the carriers via drift. So if diffusion is negligible, that makes sense. So this option seems plausible.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. A Schottky contact has a barrier, so it's a rectifying contact. But for the Mott-Gurney equation, I think the device is assumed to have good contacts, maybe Ohmic. Because if there's a Schottky barrier, that might complicate the current flow. Also, in a Schottky contact, the injection might be limited, but for SCLC, we're already beyond the point where the current is limited by the space charge. So maybe the contact type isn't the main factor here. But the option mentions negligible diffusion current, which aligns with the SCLC scenario as before.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion. Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is typically for single-carrier devices. Because in two-carrier cases, like in a p-n junction with both electrons and holes contributing, the equations might be different. Or perhaps other effects come into play. So if the device is a two-carrier type, the equation might not apply. So D is probably incorrect.

Now, back to the options. The Mott-Gurney equation is for a single-carrier device, so any options talking about two-carrier can be eliminated. So D is out.

So between A, B, and C. Let's think about the presence of barriers.

The equation is derived for a device where the current is limited by the space charge, which occurs when the electric field due to the space charge dominates. This typically happens when the injection is efficient, so that the current isn't limited by the contact but by the space charge itself.

An Ohmic contact would allow for efficient carrier injection, which is probably a condition for the SCLC regime. If there's a significant barrier (like a Schottky contact), the injection might be a limiting factor, so the current would be injection-limited rather than space-charge-limited. So for the equation to hold, the device should have good injection, which would be the case with an Ohmic contact.

Looking at option B: no carrier injection barrier. That would be consistent with Ohmic contacts, leading to efficient injection. So the current is then limited by space charge, making Mott-Gurney applicable.

Now, what about the drift vs. diffusion. Mott-Gurney's equation is derived under the assumption that the current is dominated by drift. Because the space charge creates a strong electric field which accelerates the carriers, leading to drift current. So if an option says that diffusion current is negligible, that's correct because drift is dominant.

Option B says negligible diffusion current. That would fit, as the equation relies on drift. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but option A says negligible drift current. That can't be right because the equation is all about the drift in the presence of a space charge. So if drift was negligible, the equation wouldn't apply.

So option A's condition of negligible drift doesn't make sense. Because in SCLC, drift is significant.

So option B is the right one. It's a trap-free, single-carrier device with no injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current (so drift dominates).

Wait, the options: Option B says "no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." So that aligns with the conditions.

Option A says "Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." But if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't fit. So A is incorrect.

Option C has a Schottky contact, which implies a barrier, so perhaps the injection is not efficient, but the equation requires that the current is space-charge limited, which occurs when the injection is efficient and the space charge dominates. So Schottky contacts may not be suitable for Mott-Gurney, because the injection might limit the current, not the space charge.

So the correct answer is B.

The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current ($J$) versus voltage ($V$) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and $L$ is the length of the device. This equation applies to the SCLC regime, where the current is limited by the space charge, and the electric field created by the space charge dominates. The conditions under which this equation holds are critical to its validity.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the SCLC regime relies on drift current being significant, as the space charge creates an electric field that drives the carriers via drift. If drift current were negligible, the equation would not apply. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. An Ohmic contact ensures efficient carrier injection, which is consistent with the SCLC regime. Additionally, in the SCLC regime, drift current dominates over diffusion current, so negligible diffusion current is a valid condition. This option aligns with the requirements for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold.

3. **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which can limit carrier injection. However, the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the current is space-charge limited, which requires efficient injection. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the conditions for the equation's validity.

4. **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is primarily applicable to single-carrier devices, as the presence of two carriers (e.g., electrons and holes) introduces additional complexities that are not captured by this equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
