Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I've studied some special relativity before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let's see.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give possible answers for the relative speed and total energy. I think I need to calculate each part step by step.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally. There's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, I need to make sure which way the velocities are going. Both are moving in the same direction, positive x. So the astronaut moving at 0.6c is faster than the one at 0.5c. So the relative speed should be the difference between those speeds, but adjusted with the relativistic formula.

Wait no, actually, the relative speed as observed from one astronaut's frame. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or is it the other way around? Oh, the question probably asks for the speed of one as observed from the other. So let's say, the relative speed of the slower astronaut as seen from the faster one.

But wait, I'm not sure. The problem says "relative speed," which in physics usually means the speed of one object in the rest frame of the other. So, if I'm astronaut A moving at 0.6c, then what's the speed of astronaut B in my frame? Because B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, but in the lab frame. So in my frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Here, u is the speed of B in the lab frame, and v is the speed of A. So, to find how fast B is moving relative to A, it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Wait, no, I think I might have it backward. Let me double-check the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²)), where u is the object's velocity in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (A's velocity in the lab). So, in this case, u is 0.5c (B's velocity), and v is 0.6c (A's velocity). So the relative speed of B from A's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Calculating the numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 -0.3 =0.7. So u' = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. The speed is positive, so 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. Wait, but relative speed is the magnitude, right? So it's 0.14c. So looking at the options, C and D have v_rel=0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Now, for the total energy of the system. The system consists of both astronauts, so the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c): gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding these together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈5.964 m c². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, so that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait a second—another thought. When calculating the total energy, should it be the sum of their energies in the lab frame? Because each astronaut's energy is already their relativistic energy in the lab frame. So adding them is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the system's rest frame, but that's more complicated. No, the question says "the total energy of the system." So I think adding their energies as measured in the lab frame is correct.

So the options are C and D for the relative speed. And the energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as observed from the other is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.5c\) (the slower astronaut's speed) and \(v = 0.6c\) (the faster astronaut's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E \approx 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
