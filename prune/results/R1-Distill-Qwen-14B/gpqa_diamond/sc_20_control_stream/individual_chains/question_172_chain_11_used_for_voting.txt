Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about excitation in stars, it's usually related to the ionization and excitation levels, which are governed by things like the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, because stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so these equations should apply.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is twice as high. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, that number is familiar. 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE equals k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Because when the thermal energy kT is comparable to the energy difference, you get significant excitation.

Wait, but in this case, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the number of atoms in the excited state compared to the ground state (or another state) is higher. So the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower would depend on the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g are the statistical weights. If the energy difference is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/(k) = 1 K. So ΔE/(k T) = 1/T. So N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -1/T ).

Wait, but in the question, it's about the excitation level. So maybe the excitation is the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let me think. If star_1 has twice the excitation, so the ratio N1_upper/N1_lower is twice that of star_2's N2_upper/N2_lower. So N1/N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower).

But wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps it's the population in the excited state relative to the lower state for each star. Let's denote for star 1, the ratio as R1 = N1_upper / N1_lower, and for star 2, R2 = N2_upper / N2_lower. Then R1 = 2 * R2.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (since it's the same element, same energy levels), then R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait, but wait a second. The energy difference is ΔE, so the exponent is -ΔE/(k T). So for star 1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So we have R1 = 2 R2. Substituting the expressions, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). Hmm. Let me take the natural log of both sides to make this manageable.

ln(R1) = ln(2) + ln(R2), but let me proceed step by step.

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K. Because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K → T would be 1 K. Wait no, the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k * T, where T is 1 K, but wait, that would mean that ΔE/(k) = T. Wait, no, because ΔE = k * T → T = ΔE/k. So ΔE/(k) = T. Because ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1 K) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ] = ln(2)

Wait, but wait, the equation I got was:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

But since ΔE/(k) = T, or wait, no. Wait, ΔE is fixed, so ΔE/(k) is a fixed number. Oh, right, because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = T where T is 1 K. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because ΔE is fixed. Let me think again.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's correct that. ΔE is a fixed number. So ΔE/(k) is a fixed value. For example, if ΔE = 2k, then ΔE/(k) = 2. But in our case, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * (1 K). So ΔE/(k) = 1 K. So when we have:

(1 K) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, but that can't be right because it's (1/T2 - 1/T1) multiplied by 1 K, which would give units of K*(1/K) = dimensionless. But ln(2) is dimensionless, so the units check out.

But let's see. Let's rearrange the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) / (1 K) → But wait, our equation is:

[ΔE/(k)] * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) = ln(2)

But since [ΔE/(k)] is 1 K, this becomes:

(1 K) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but this leads to:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = ln(2) / (1 K) → which is ln(2) K^{-1}.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the right-hand side would have units of K^{-1}, which matches the left-hand side. So:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (ln 2) / (1 K) → because 1 K * (something in K^{-1}) equals dimensionless.

But wait, 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) is equal to (ln 2) / (ΔE/(k)) ) → because from earlier.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to substitute T as the temperatures and proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:

R1 = 2 R2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln 2 → 

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln 2.

But ΔE/(k) is 1 K, as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K. So substituting:

(1 K) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) / (1 K) → which is ln(2) K^{-1}.

Hmm, but this gives:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) → since 1 K * (ln(2) K^{-1}) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1 K × (something per K) is unitless. So that's correct, right?

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Wait, but the options are in terms of T1 and T2 in various combinations.

Let me rearrange the equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) T1 T2

So that gives T1 - T2 = ln(2) T1 T2.

Then, if I factor:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) T1 T2 → 

Divide both sides by (T1 T2):

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as the right-hand side. So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

So looking back at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation level of star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the relevant energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which is equal to Boltzmann's constant (k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K). This implies ΔE = kT, where T = 1 K.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = g \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g\) is the statistical weight. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are \(R_1 = \frac{N_{\text{upper,1}}}{N_{\text{lower,1}}}\) and \(R_2 = \frac{N_{\text{upper,2}}}{N_{\text{lower,2}}}\), respectively. The problem states that \(R_1 = 2R_2\). Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Multiplying through by \(T_1T_2\):

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \ln(2) \cdot T_1T_2.
\]

Dividing both sides by \(T_1T_2\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship.
