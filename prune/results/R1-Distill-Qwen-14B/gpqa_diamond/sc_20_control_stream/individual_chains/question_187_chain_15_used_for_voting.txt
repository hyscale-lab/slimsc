Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether it can detect certain stars. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question is asking how many of the listed stars would be detectable by ESPRESSO when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The detectability condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for things like detecting exoplanets and studying stellar motions. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics of its sensitivity. Oh wait, I think it's designed to have a high S/N ratio, especially useful for precise measurements.

The problem gives six options (a to f) with different stars. I'll need to evaluate each one based on their properties to see if they meet the S/N requirement.

Each star in the options has some characteristics. Let me list them out:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, V=15 mag, same RA and DEC as others
d) Star at 200 pc, V=15 mag
e) Star at 5 pc, V=15 mag
f) Star at 50 pc, V=15 mag

Wait, the RA and DEC all being 0°,0° probably means they're all at the same point in the sky, so the distance is varying. The absolute V magnitude is the same for c, d, e, f. But wait, absolute magnitude is a measure of intrinsic brightness, so the apparent magnitude would depend on distance.

So for each star, I need to find the apparent V magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula.

The distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

So m = M + 5 log(d/10)

M is given as 15 mag for c, d, e, f. Let's calculate their m.

Wait, but for Canopus and Polaris, I need to find their apparent magnitudes as seen from Earth. Because the S/N depends on the apparent brightness, which affects the photon count and thus the S/N.

Wait, ESPRESSO's S/N depends on the star's apparent brightness. So a brighter star (lower m) would give a higher S/N.

So first, I need to find the apparent magnitude (m) for each star.

But for stars a and b, Canopus and Polaris, I need to look up their actual apparent magnitudes.

Canopus: I remember it's a bright star, in the southern skies. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Sirius is the brightest at -1.5. Canopus is the second brightest. I think Canopus is around -0.7 or -0.5? I'm not exactly sure, but I'll have to note that it's a very bright star, so m is less than 0.

Polaris is a well-known star, the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2. But maybe a bit lower. Wait, I recall it's about 1.98 or so. So approximately 2.0.

So for star a (Canopus), m is around -0.7.

Star b (Polaris), m is about 2.0.

Now, for the other stars (c, d, e, f), their absolute magnitude M is 15. But their distances vary.

Let me compute their apparent magnitudes.

Starting with option c: 10 pc.

m = 15 + 5 log(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.

So apparent mag is 15.

Option e: 5 pc.

m =15 + 5*log(5/10) = 15 +5*log(0.5) → log(0.5) is -0.3010.

So 5*(-0.3010) = -1.505. So m =15 -1.505 = 13.495 ≈13.5.

Option f: 50 pc.

m =15 +5*log(50/10) =15 +5*log(5) → log(5)=0.69897.

5*0.69897≈3.4949. So m=15+3.4949=18.4949≈18.5.

Option d: 200 pc.

m=15+5*log(200/10)=15 +5*log(20) → log(20)=1.3010.

5*1.3010=6.505 → m=15+6.505=21.505≈21.5.

Wait, but wait. Absolute magnitude M is defined as the apparent magnitude if the star were at 10 pc. So more distant stars have larger m, since they're fainter.

So now, for each star, we have their apparent V magnitudes.

Now, the next step is to find what the S/N ratio would be for each. The S/N depends on the flux from the star. Higher flux (brighter star) gives higher S/N.

The formula for S/N in spectroscopy is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(t)) / (noise), where t is the exposure time. But perhaps a simplified approach is to think in terms of how brightness affects S/N.

Alternatively, I've heard that the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the brightness (flux) of the star. So, S/N is proportional to sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4*m/2.5), where m is the apparent magnitude.

Wait, let me clarify. The flux F from a star is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the flux from a star of m=0. So brighter stars have higher F.

The noise in the spectrum is proportional to 1/sqrt(F) * the readout noise, but perhaps for this problem, it's more about the photon noise. Alternatively, the S/N per pixel can be approximated as proportional to sqrt(N_photons), which depends on the star's brightness and exposure time.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think: the S/N per pixel is proportional to (F * sqrt(t)) / sqrt(R), where R is the read noise. But perhaps, for this problem, we can model it with a simple formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO spectrograph has certain characteristics. Let me try to find what I can remember or find out.

From the ESPRESSO overview, I think it's a high-resolution spectrograph (like resolving power R ≈ 140,000). It's designed for high S/N, especially for Doppler measurements.

But perhaps for this problem, the key is to know the faintest magnitude that ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 per binned pixel in one hour.

Wait, I remember that ESPRESSO is very sensitive, but perhaps the limit depends on the star's magnitude. Maybe it's something like it can reach a certain S/N for stars down to a certain magnitude.

But without exact data, perhaps I can think in terms of the V magnitude and exposure time.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the S/N as a function of magnitude and exposure time.

The S/N ratio per pixel is proportional to the square root of the number of photons collected. The number of photons depends on the star's flux and the exposure time.

So for each star, the flux F is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 * m), where F_0 is the flux of a zero-mag star.

The number of photons N is F * t, where t is the exposure time in seconds.

So S/N ratio per pixel would be proportional to sqrt(N) = sqrt(F * t).

But wait, in reality, the S/N also depends on the system's efficiency, the telescope's collecting area, and the instrument's response. But perhaps for this problem, we can approximate using a standard formula.

Wait, I think a common formula is that the S/N ratio scales with 10^(-0.4 * m) multiplied by sqrt(t), but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that for a given star, the S/N depends inversely on the star's magnitude. So if a star is brighter (lower m), the S/N is higher.

But let me try to find some approximate relationship.

Suppose that for a certain exposure time, the S/N per pixel for a star of magnitude m is S/N(m) = S_0 * 10^(-0.1 * m) * sqrt(t), where S_0 is a constant.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact exponent. Let's think about it.

The flux F from a star is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the flux of a star at m=0. The number of photons is proportional to F * t. So the number of photons N is proportional to F * t.

The noise is the square root of the number of photons plus other noises, but let's assume for this problem that it's dominated by photon noise. So the S/N is proportional to sqrt(N) = sqrt(F * t) = sqrt(t) * sqrt(F) = sqrt(t) * F^(1/2).

So substituting F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), we get:

S/N = k * sqrt(t) * (F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m)) )^(1/2)

= k * sqrt(t) * F_0^(1/2) * 10^(-0.2 m)

Assuming F_0 is a constant, we can write this as:

S/N = C * sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m), where C = k * sqrt(F_0)

So, for a given exposure time t, the S/N is C * sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m).

But without knowing the exact value of C, perhaps we can find the threshold for each star.

We need the S/N to be at least 10 per binned pixel.

So for each star, compute S/N and see if it's >=10.

But what's the value of C? Hmm. Maybe I can find it from a reference star.

Suppose, for example, that a star of m=10 gives S/N=10 with 1 hour exposure.

Then,

10 = C * sqrt(3600) * 10^(-0.2 * 10)

Wait, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. sqrt(3600)=60.

C * 60 * 10^(-2) = 10

Because m=10: 10^(-0.2 *10) =10^(-2)=0.01.

So,

C *60 *0.01 =10 → C*0.6 =10 → C=10 /0.6 ≈16.6667.

So, C≈16.667.

So the formula becomes:

S/N = 16.667 * sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m)

But wait, this is under the assumption that for m=10, the S/N is 10 with t=3600 seconds. Maybe that's an assumption for the problem, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to know that the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when coupled to an 8m VLT, can achieve a certain S/N for stars of a certain magnitude in a certain exposure time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to think about the V magnitude and whether each star is bright enough.

Let me try to think differently. For each star, I can compute their apparent magnitude. Then, based on that, determine if the S/N would be >=10.

But without knowing the exact S/N curve, perhaps I can use a rule of thumb.

I remember that for ground-based telescopes, a V magnitude around 20 is about the limit for detecting a star with a certain S/N in a few hours. But since this is a 1-hour exposure, the stars need to be much brighter.

Wait, but ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph with high efficiency, but I think it's optimized for brighter stars to achieve high S/N.

Wait, let me think about each star:

a) Canopus: m ≈-0.7. That's very bright. So S/N would be way above 10. Definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈2.0. Bright. Should also have high S/N, so detectable.

c) m=15. That's a very faint star. I think that's way beyond ESPRESSO's capability in 1 hour. So S/N would be less than 10.

d) m=21.5. Even fainter, so no.

e) m=13.5. Hmm, maybe possible, but I'm not sure.

f) m=18.5. Definitely too faint.

Wait, but actually, I'm not certain about the exact S/N vs. magnitude relationship for ESPRESSO.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that ESPRESSO has a certain minimum magnitude it can handle for a given S/N and exposure time. For example, when using ESPRESSO with the VLT, perhaps the S/N per pixel for a star of V magnitude m is S/N = 10^(-0.3 m) * sqrt(t), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use an example. Let's say for a star at m=10, with t=1 hour (3600 sec), the S/N is S.

If I can find S for m=10, then I can compute for other m's.

But without that data, perhaps I can think of the exposure time and how it scales.

Wait, another approach: The S/N increases with the square root of exposure time. So if a star of m=15 gives S/N=10 in t seconds, then for m=15, S/N=10 in t=1 hour. But I don't have that data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that for a given exposure time, the S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t).

So, for each star, compute 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t), and see if it's >=10, considering any constants.

But I'm not sure about the exact proportionality. Maybe I can think that the S/N per pixel is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = 10^(0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is some reference magnitude.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of how many stars are brighter than a certain magnitude.

If the required S/N is 10 per binned pixel, then the stars that are bright enough to achieve this in 1 hour would be those with m below a certain value.

So let me try to find the maximum m that can give S/N=10 in 1 hour.

Assuming that S/N = k * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t), where k is a constant.

Set S/N=10, t=3600 sec.

So 10 = k * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(3600)

sqrt(3600)=60.

So 10 = k * 10^(-0.4 m) * 60 → k * 10^(-0.4 m) = 10/60 ≈0.1667.

But without knowing k, I can't find m.

But perhaps I can think of a reference point. Let's assume that a star with m=8 has S/N=10 in 1 hour.

So 10 = k * 10^(-0.4*8) * 60.

Calculate 10^(-3.2) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.2) ≈ 0.001 * 0.631 = 0.000631.

So,

10 = k * 0.000631 *60 → 10 = k * 0.03786 → k ≈10/0.03786 ≈264.4.

So then the formula is S/N =264.4 * 10^(-0.4 m) *60 → no wait, no, the formula is S/N =k *10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

Wait, wait, earlier I had S/N =k * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

But when m=8, t=3600, S/N=10.

So,

10 =k *10^(-3.2) * 60 → 10= k *0.000631 *60 → 10 =k *0.03786 → k=264.4.

So the formula is S/N =264.4 *10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

Wait, but wait, this seems high. Let me check the math again.

Wait, 10^(-0.4 *8)=10^(-3.2)= approx 6.31e-4.

So 6.31e-4 *60=0.3786.

So 10 =k * 0.3786 → k=10/0.3786≈26.44.

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

So now, k=26.44.

So the formula is S/N =26.44 * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

But wait, with this, for a star of m=, say, 10 and t=3600:

S/N=26.44 * 10^(-4) * 60 =26.44 *0.0001 *60=26.44 *0.006= 0.1586. Which is way less than 10. So that can't be correct.

Wait, maybe the formula is the other way around. Perhaps S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m) multiplied by sqrt(t).

Wait, perhaps I should instead think of the S/N as S/N = (some constant) * 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

But without exact data, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know that ESPRESSO can detect stars down to a certain V magnitude with a certain S/N in one hour.

I think that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 10 for stars as faint as V=15 or maybe even fainter. Wait, but that seems too optimistic because most ground-based telescopes can't reach such faint magnitudes in an hour.

Wait, another approach: the V magnitude is related to the flux. Let's calculate the flux for each star and compare it to the required flux for S/N=10.

Flux (f) is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m). The noise is proportional to 1/sqrt(f). So the S/N is f * sqrt(t) / noise component.

Wait, perhaps the S/N per pixel is proportional to f * sqrt(t) / (some noise factor).

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about this in terms of the V magnitude and exposure time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to note that stars with lower magnitudes (brighter) are detectable. So Canopus and Polaris are bright, but stars beyond a certain distance (like e, f, d) are too faint.

Wait, looking back at the problem:

The options are:

a) Canopus → m≈-0.7 → very bright → S/N>10.

b) Polaris → m≈2 → bright → S/N>10.

c) m=15 → very faint → no.

d) m=21.5 → way too faint → no.

e) m=13.5 → perhaps detectable?

f) m=18.5 → no.

So from this, a and b are detectable, and perhaps e is detectable?

Wait, but is m=13.5 bright enough?

Hmm, let me think about the V magnitude scale. A V magnitude of 0 is about 3640 Jy (using V=0 corresponds to a flux density of about 3640 Janskys), and each magnitude increase reduces the flux by a factor of about 2.512.

So for m=13.5, the flux is much lower than m=8.

But again, without exact data on ESPRESSO's sensitivity, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to count only the stars that are bright enough. Let's see:

a) Canopus → detectable.

b) Polaris → detectable.

c) m=15 → not detectable.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → maybe yes? Or no?

f) m=18.5 → no.

But I'm uncertain about e. How can I decide?

Wait, perhaps I can think about the formula again. Let's say S/N per pixel is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t).

Assuming that for m=10, S/N=10 (as an example), then for m=13.5:

S/N = 10 * (10^(-0.4 *13.5) /10^(-0.4 *10)) ) * sqrt(3600/3600) → same exposure time.

10^(-0.4 *13.5) =10^(-5.4) ≈ 3.98e-6.

10^(-0.4 *10)=10^(-4)=1e-4.

So the ratio is (3.98e-6)/(1e-4) )=0.0398.

So S/N=10 * 0.0398 ≈0.398 <10. So no.

Wait, that can't be right because S/N would be less than 10.

Wait, perhaps that approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be S/N = 10^(-0.4 m) * sqrt(t) * some other factor.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a way to estimate the exposure time needed for a given S/N and m.

The formula for the required exposure time t to reach S/N is:

t = ( (S/N)^2 * 10^(0.4 (m - m0)) ) / C

Where C is a constant based on the instrument and telescope.

But without knowing C or m0, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to determine based on the apparent magnitude whether the star is bright enough.

Given that Canopus and Polaris are bright, and the others are varying, perhaps the answer is that only a and b are detectable. So that would be 2 stars.

But wait, option e is at 5 pc, m=13.5. How does that compare?

If I think about the V magnitude, m=13.5 is quite faint. For ground-based telescopes, reaching such magnitudes in an hour is tough. So perhaps only a and b are detectable.

Wait, but wait: the problem says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes". So the VLT is a large telescope, which would collect more light, improving S/N.

ESPRESSO's design is for very high S/N, so perhaps stars fainter than m=10 are possible.

I've read that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 10 for a G-type star (like the Sun) in about 100 seconds. Wait, but the Sun is much brighter than m=0.

Wait, but if it can achieve S/N=10 for a V=0 star in 100 seconds, then in 3600 seconds (1 hour), it would be:

S/N scales with sqrt(t), so sqrt(3600/100)=sqrt(36)=6.

So S/N would be 10 *6=60 per pixel.

But that's for a V=0 star. For each magnitude increase, S/N decreases by a factor of sqrt(2.512) → approx 1.58.

Wait, because each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in flux, so the photon count goes down by 2.512 per magnitude, and S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), so each magnitude increase reduces S/N by a factor of sqrt(2.512)≈1.58.

So for a star with m=8, which is 8 magnitudes fainter than m=0, S/N would be 60 / (1.58^8).

1.58^2=2.4964, 1.58^4≈6.23, 1.58^8≈38.8.

So S/N=60 /38.8 ≈1.54. Which is less than 10. So a V=8 star would have S/N ~1.5, which is too low.

Wait, that's not possible. Because if it's 100 seconds for m=0, then 1 hour is 3600 seconds =36 times longer. So exposure time scales with S/N as sqrt(t), so S/N=10 * sqrt(36)=60 for m=0.

But for m=8, each magnitude reduces S/N by sqrt(2.512) → so 8 magnitudes would be (sqrt(2.512))^8.

Which is (2.512)^(4) → approx 2.512^2=6.31, ^4=6.31^2≈39.8. So S/N=60 /39.8≈1.5.

But that would mean that a V=8 star would only give S/N≈1.5, which is way below the required 10.

So that suggests that the only stars that can reach S/N=10 are those brighter than m=0, which is only Canopus (m=-0.7) and perhaps Polaris (m=2.0). But wait, Polaris is m=2.0, which is 2 magnitudes fainter than m=0.

So let's compute for m=2.0. How much S/N would that get?

S/N for m=2.0: each magnitude is a factor of sqrt(2.512) ≈1.58.

So for m=2, 2 magnitudes: 1.58^2≈2.496.

So S/N=60 /2.496≈24.03 → which is above 10. So Polaris would have S/N ~24, which is good.

What about a star at m=5? S/N=60 / (1.58^5).

1.58^5: 1.58^2=2.496, ^4=6.23, *1.58=9.85.

So S/N=60/9.85≈6.09 <10 → not enough.

So for m=2, S/N is 24, which is good. m=3, let's see:

1.58^3 = 1.58 *2.496≈3.94. 60/3.94≈15.23 → which is above 10. So a star with m=3 would have S/N≈15.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting info here. Because earlier, for m=8, it's too faint, but for m=3, it's okay.

Wait, this suggests that stars with m down to about 3 or 4 might be detectable in 1 hour.

So going back to the problem, the stars are:

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: m=2 → yes.

c) m=15 → no.

d) m=21.5 → no.

e) m=13.5 → no.

f) m=18.5 → no.

Wait, but according to this calculation, any star with m less than or equal to 3 would be okay. But what about m=5?

Wait, let me recalculate for m=5.

Each magnitude is a factor of sqrt(2.512)≈1.58.

m=5: 5 magnitudes, so 1.58^5≈ 1.58 * (1.58^4)=1.58 * 6.23≈9.85.

So S/N=60 /9.85≈6.09 <10. So not enough.

So a star at m=5 would have S/N≈6, which is below 10.

Thus, only stars with m less than or equal to 2 would have S/N >=10.

So among the options, which stars have m<=2?

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → yes.

b) Polaris: m=2 → yes.

So that's two stars.

But wait, what about option e, which is at m=13.5? That's way too faint.

So the answer would be 2 stars (a and b), so option A) 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that m=2 gives S/N=24, which is good. So a and b are detectable.

So the correct answer is 2 stars: a and b.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we evaluate each star based on its apparent magnitude \( m \) and whether it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the star's brightness, as fainter stars (higher \( m \)) produce fewer photons and lower S/N.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Apparent Magnitude and S/N Relationship**:  
   The S/N ratio is proportional to the flux of the star, which decreases with increasing magnitude. For a star of apparent magnitude \( m \), the flux is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). The S/N scales as \( \sqrt{t} \cdot 10^{-0.4m} \), where \( t \) is the exposure time. For a 1-hour exposure (\( t = 3600 \, \text{s} \)), the S/N depends on the star's brightness.

2. **Threshold for Detectability**:  
   A star is detectable if its S/N is at least 10. Based on the sensitivity of ESPRESSO and the 8m VLT telescope, stars with very high magnitudes (e.g., \( m > 10 \)) are unlikely to meet this threshold in 1 hour. Brighter stars (lower \( m \)) are more likely to achieve the required S/N.

3. **Evaluation of Each Star**:  
   - **(a) Canopus**: Apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This star is very bright and will easily achieve an S/N > 10. **Detectable.**  
   - **(b) Polaris**: Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \). This star is also bright and will achieve an S/N > 10. **Detectable.**  
   - **(c) Star at 10 pc**: Apparent magnitude \( m = 15 \). This star is very faint and will not achieve an S/N of 10. **Not detectable.**  
   - **(d) Star at 200 pc**: Apparent magnitude \( m = 21.5 \). This star is extremely faint and will not achieve an S/N of 10. **Not detectable.**  
   - **(e) Star at 5 pc**: Apparent magnitude \( m = 13.5 \). This star is faint and will not achieve an S/N of 10. **Not detectable.**  
   - **(f) Star at 50 pc**: Apparent magnitude \( m = 18.5 \). This star is too faint to achieve an S/N of 10. **Not detectable.**

### Conclusion:
Only Canopus (a) and Polaris (b) are bright enough to achieve an S/N of at least 10 in 1 hour. The other stars are too faint to meet the threshold.

**Answer: A**
