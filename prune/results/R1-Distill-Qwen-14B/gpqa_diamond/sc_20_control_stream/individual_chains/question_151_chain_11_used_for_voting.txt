Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step. 

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh wait, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to have a norm of 1. So I should probably normalize this vector first. 

Let me calculate the norm. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. So each component squared: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector should be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Wait, but sometimes people write them as a column vector, but the order is correct here.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P as given. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So it's a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian operators. I should check if P is Hermitian. Because if it's not, then the eigenvalues might not be real, which would complicate things.

So for P to be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Let's see: the elements of P are all real numbers, except perhaps for the 1/sqrt(2) terms. So the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Let's transpose P. The original P has elements:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Transposing it would swap the rows and columns. So the first column becomes the first row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0—same as row 1. Second column: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)—same as row 2. Third column: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0—same as row 3. So P is equal to its transpose, so it's Hermitian. Okay, that's good because the eigenvalues (possible measurement outcomes) will be real.

The question is to find the probability that the measurement of P yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them. Then, find the eigenvector corresponding to 0 and calculate the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Because sometimes the observable can be expressed in terms of projectors, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the state in that eigenspace.

Wait, another approach: the probability of getting a value a when measuring an observable P is given by the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace of a.

So, first, I should find the eigenvalues of P. Let me compute the eigenvalues.

The matrix P is:

[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write P - λ I:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Calculating the determinant:

Expand along the first row. So the determinant is:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2), -λ ] )
- 1/sqrt(2) * det( [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2); 0, -λ ] )
+ 0 * something.

First term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]
= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ]
= - (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -λ / sqrt(2) )
= (λ) / 2

Third term is zero.

So the determinant equation is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0

Factor out λ:

λ [ - (λ² - 1/2 ) + 1/2 ] = 0

Wait, let's expand the equation:

-λ^3 + (λ * 1/2 ) + (λ/2 ) ) = 0

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recompute:

Wait, the determinant is:

-λ * [ ( -λ ) ( -λ ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2)) (-λ ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ]
+ 0.

So the first term is -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ].

The second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ / sqrt(2) ) ] 

Which is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) = (λ ) / 2.

So the determinant equation becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0.

So, expand this:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, because:

-λ*(λ²) = -λ^3,

-λ*(-1/2) = + (λ/2).

Plus the second term: + (λ/2).

So total: -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So the equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor:

λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ=0, or -λ² +1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.

So the possible measurement outcomes are 0,1,-1. So 0 is a possible outcome.

So the probability we're looking for is the probability that the measurement gives 0.

To find that, I need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the squared inner product between the state vector and that eigenvector.

So first, find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v =0.

So the matrix is the same as P.

So the system of equations is:

1) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

3) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as equation 1, since v2=0.

So from equation 1, v2=0.

From equation 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3)^T where v1 = -v3. So we can write this as v3*(-1, 0, 1)^T.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (-1, 0, 1)^T.

So the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Wait, because when I substituted, I got v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are of the form [ -v3, 0, v3 ]^T = v3*(-1,0,1)^T.

So this is a one-dimensional eigenspace.

So the eigenvector can be taken as (-1, 0, 1)^T. But we can also normalize it.

The norm of this vector is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So the projection onto this eigenspace is given by the outer product of this normalized eigenvector with itself.

But another approach is to compute the inner product of the state with the eigenvector, then square the absolute value.

Wait, the state is given as the column vector with elements (-1,2,1). We normalized it earlier to ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Wait, the eigenvector for 0 is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So the inner product is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the eigenvector.

Let me compute this inner product: ( (-1/sqrt(6)) , (2/sqrt(6)), (1/sqrt(6)) ) multiplied by ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ).

Wait, no, actually, inner product is the sum of the products of corresponding components. So:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) ) * ( -1/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)).

So compute each term:

First term: (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = same as first term, so 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Adding them together: 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product. Since it's real and positive, the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, that's option C.

To solve the problem, we first normalize the given state vector. The state vector is initially given as \( (-1, 2, 1)^T \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring 0, we determine the eigenvalues of \( P \). Solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), we find the eigenvalues to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \) corresponds to the measurement outcome 0.

Next, we find the eigenvector associated with \( \lambda = 0 \). Solving \( (P - 0I)v = 0 \), we find that the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
v = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this eigenvector, we get:

\[
v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring 0 is the squared modulus of the inner product between the normalized state \( \psi \) and the normalized eigenvector \( v \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle \psi | v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Calculating term by term:

\[
\langle \psi | v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (1 + 0 + 1) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle \psi | v \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
