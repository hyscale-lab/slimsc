Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. These planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're asking about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Hmm, I think I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Since they have the same albedo, that part won't affect the ratio. So, it's mainly about their orbital distances.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature... Oh right, it's something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - abedo) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) )^(1/4), but since the albedo is the same and assuming circular orbits (so e is zero), the formula simplifies. So the equilibrium temperature should depend on the distance from the star. 

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula I know is T = T_eff * ( (R_star / (2a)) )^(1/2), where a is the semi-major axis (which, for circular orbits, is just the radius). But wait, another way I've heard it is that the equilibrium temperature scales with the inverse square root of the orbital period, assuming the star's luminosity is constant. Because the period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law.

Wait, let me think. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), right? So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So if I have two planets, the ratio of their distances a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so the ratio would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Then, equilibrium temperature scales as inverse square root of a. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), since the flux from the star decreases with 1/a², and equilibrium temp is based on the balance between absorbed and emitted radiation. So T ∝ (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), because (1/a²)^(1/4) is 1/a^(1/2).

Putting it together: T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Or wait, wait. Let me get this right.

If a4 is larger than a2, then a4/a2 is greater than 1, so T4 would be smaller than T2 because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ).

But a2 and a4 are related through their periods. Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( (P2 / P4) )^(1/ (3/2)) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's redo this step.

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio is (a2/a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2 / P4) )^( (2/3) * (1/2) ) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, that's because a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Then sqrt of that is (P2/P4)^(1/3). So the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait. Let's think again.

Equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis a. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

But a ∝ P^(2/3), so T ∝ 1/( P^(2/3) )^(1/2 ) ) = 1/(P^(1/3)).

So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So the temperature ratio T4 / T2 is ( P2 / P4 )^(1/3 ), because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me check that again. If T ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and a ∝ P^(2/3), then sqrt(a) is P^(1/3), so 1/sqrt(a) is P^(-1/3). So yes, T ∝ P^(-1/3), which is the same as T ∝ (1/P)^(1/3).

So the ratio T4 / T2 is (P2 / P4 )^(1/3 ).

Wait no, wait. Because T4 is for planet 4, so its period is P4, and T2 is for planet 2, period P2.

So T4 = T0 * ( P4 )^(-1/3 ), where T0 is a proportionality constant.

T2 = T0 * ( P2 )^(-1/3 ).

So the ratio T4/T2 = [ (P4)^(-1/3) ] / [ (P2 )^(-1/3) ] = ( P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

But wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

T4 / T2 = (T4) / (T2) = [ (1/P4^(1/3)) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

Yes, correct.

So now we have to plug in the period ratios given.

The periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5.

Wait, the problem says the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So for Planet_1, P1 = 1 unit.

Planet_2 has P2 = 2 units.

Planet_3 has P3 = 2.5 units.

Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units.

Planet_5 has P5=5 units.

So, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, their periods are 3.5 and 2 respectively.

So P2=2, P4=3.5.

So, the ratio P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 2/(7/2) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (P2/P4) = 4/7.

Now, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, no! No, wait, because T4 is for planet 4, which has P4=3.5. So when we compute T4/T2, it's (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So yes, (2/3.5) = 4/7.

So (4/7) ≈ 0.5714.

So, (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.5714.

What's the cube root of 0.5714?

Well, cube of 0.8 is 0.512, cube of 0.82 is about 0.82^3 = 0.82*0.82=0.6724; 0.6724 *0.82 ≈ 0.551368.

Hmm, 0.82^3 ≈ 0.551, which is a bit lower than 0.5714.

Wait, 0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889; 0.6889 *0.83 = let's compute.

0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, 0.6889 * 0.03=0.020667. So total ≈ 0.55112 + 0.020667 ≈ 0.571787. Oh, that's really close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, because 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787.

So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3), which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio T4 : T2 is approximately 0.83, which would mean Planet 4 is cooler than Planet 2, which makes sense because it's farther out.

But looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The problem says the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So it's T4 / T2.

Which we calculated as approximately 0.83.

So the options: option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises because the semi-major axis \( a \) (proportional to \( P^{2/3} \)) affects the flux received by the planet, and \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we identify:
- \( P_2 = 2 \) (for Planet_2),
- \( P_4 = 3.5 \) (for Planet_4).

The temperature ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \):
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplify \( \frac{2}{3.5} \) to \( \frac{4}{7} \), so:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \), we find that the cube root of \( 0.5714 \) (the decimal equivalent of \( 4/7 \)) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Thus, the temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \approx 0.83 \).

Among the options provided, the closest match is **C) ~0.83**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Wait, let me think. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), right? So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So if I have two planets, the ratio of their distances a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so the ratio would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Then, equilibrium temperature scales as inverse square root of a. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), since the flux from the star decreases with 1/a², and equilibrium temp is based on the balance between absorbed and emitted radiation. So T ∝ (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), because (1/a²)^(1/4) is 1/a^(1/2).

Putting it together: T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Or wait, wait. Let me get this right.

If a4 is larger than a2, then a4/a2 is greater than 1, so T4 would be smaller than T2 because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ).

But a2 and a4 are related through their periods. Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( (P2 / P4) )^(1/ (3/2)) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's redo this step.

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio is (a2/a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2 / P4) )^( (2/3) * (1/2) ) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, that's because a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Then sqrt of that is (P2/P4)^(1/3). So the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait. Let's think again.

Equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis a. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

But a ∝ P^(2/3), so T ∝ 1/( P^(2/3) )^(1/2 ) ) = 1/(P^(1/3)).

So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So the temperature ratio T4 / T2 is ( P2 / P4 )^(1/3 ), because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me check that again. If T ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and a ∝ P^(2/3), then sqrt(a) is P^(1/3), so 1/sqrt(a) is P^(-1/3). So yes, T ∝ P^(-1/3), which is the same as T ∝ (1/P)^(1/3).

So the ratio T4 / T2 is (P2 / P4 )^(1/3 ).

Wait no, wait. Because T4 is for planet 4, so its period is P4, and T2 is for planet 2, period P2.

So T4 = T0 * ( P4 )^(-1/3 ), where T0 is a proportionality constant.

T2 = T0 * ( P2 )^(-1/3 ).

So the ratio T4/T2 = [ (P4)^(-1/3) ] / [ (P2 )^(-1/3) ] = ( P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

But wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

T4 / T2 = (T4) / (T2) = [ (1/P4^(1/3)) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2 / P4 )^(1/3 )

Yes, correct.

So now we have to plug in the period ratios given.

The periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5.

Wait, the problem says the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So for Planet_1, P1 = 1 unit.

Planet_2 has P2 = 2 units.

Planet_3 has P3 = 2.5 units.

Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units.

Planet_5 has P5=5 units.

So, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, their periods are 3.5 and 2 respectively.

So P2=2, P4=3.5.

So, the ratio P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 2/(7/2) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (P2/P4) = 4/7.

Now, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, no! No, wait, because T4 is for planet 4, which has P4=3.5. So when we compute T4/T2, it's (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So yes, (2/3.5) = 4/7.

So (4/7) ≈ 0.5714.

So, (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.5714.

What's the cube root of 0.5714?

Well, cube of 0.8 is 0.512, cube of 0.82 is about 0.82^3 = 0.82*0.82=0.6724; 0.6724 *0.82 ≈ 0.551368.

Hmm, 0.82^3 ≈ 0.551, which is a bit lower than 0.5714.

Wait, 0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889; 0.6889 *0.83 = let's compute.

0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, 0.6889 * 0.03=0.020667. So total ≈ 0.55112 + 0.020667 ≈ 0.571787. Oh, that's really close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, because 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787.

So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3), which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio T4 : T2 is approximately 0.83, which would mean Planet 4 is cooler than Planet 2, which makes sense because it's farther out.

But looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The problem says the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So it's T4 / T2.

Which we calculated as approximately 0.83.

So the options: option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be C.
