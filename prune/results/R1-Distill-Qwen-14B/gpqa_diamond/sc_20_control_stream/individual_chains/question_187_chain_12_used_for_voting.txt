Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with one of the VLT 8m telescopes. The condition is that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel should be at least 10 after a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I should understand what factors determine the detectability of a star with a spectrograph. I remember that the S/N depends on the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency and resolution.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph designed for the VLT. From what I recall, ESPRESSO combines the light from up to four 8.2m Unit Telescopes, but in this case, it's coupled with one 8m VLT telescope, so it's using just one.

The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / noise. But wait, I think the exact formula might be S/N = (count_rate * sqrt(t)) / noise, where t is the exposure time. Alternatively, I remember that S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. 

Flux from a star depends on its apparent brightness. Apparent magnitude is what determines how much light we receive. So, the absolute magnitude of the star and its distance from us are crucial because they determine its apparent magnitude.

The absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) the star would have at a standard distance of 10 parsecs. The formula to find m is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes. Then, knowing the telescope's collecting area and spectrograph efficiency, I can estimate if the S/N would be ≥10.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to calculate everything from scratch. I remember that the VLT's collecting area is large, but the ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance depends on the brightness of the star because dimmer stars will have lower S/N.

Looking at the options:

a) Canopus: I know Canopus is a very bright star, with an apparent magnitude around -0.7. So it's very bright. Definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a moderately bright star, about magnitude 2.0. So also likely detectable.

c) Star with M=15 mag, located at 10 pc: So m = 15 + 5 log10(10/10) = 15 + 5*0 =15. So apparent magnitude 15. That's a pretty faint star.

d) Same M=15, but at 200 pc. Let's compute m: 5 log(200/10) = 5 log(20) ≈5*(1.301)=6.505. So m=15+6.505=21.505. That's very faint.

e) Same M=15, 5 pc: m=15 +5 log(5/10)=15 +5*(-0.301)=15 -1.505=13.495. So about 13.5 magnitude.

f) M=15, 50 pc: m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15+5*(1.698)=15+8.49≈23.49. Also very faint.

Wait, but how does the apparent magnitude relate to the S/N with ESPRESSO?

I think the S/N per pixel depends on the star's flux. Brighter stars = more photons, higher S/N. But the exact threshold depends on the instrument's capabilities.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but it's also sensitive. I remember that ESPRESSO can reach down to certain magnitudes, but I'm not exactly sure. But perhaps I can think in terms of how much light each star provides.

The VLT's 8.2m telescope has a collecting area of about 50 m². Wait, no, the area is π*(D/2)^2. For D=8.2m, area is ~52.8 m². But since it's a 10m telescope, wait no, no, 8.2m. So yeah, around 52.8 m².

But the exact area might not be needed if I can relate the star's magnitude to the exposure time and S/N.

The formula for the number of photons collected is N_ph = F * t * A * ε * QE * (exposure time) * (other factors), where F is the flux from the star, A is the collecting area, ε is the efficiency of the spectrograph, QE the quantum efficiency, etc.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between magnitude and S/N.

I remember that for a given exposure time, the S/N for a star scales with 10^(-0.4 m) because each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness.

Alternatively, the S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux, which relates to the magnitude.

Wait, let me think of the formula. The S/N per pixel is given by:

S/N = (F * t) / sqrt(F) ) * some constants.

Wait, actually, the S/N equation is often approximated as S/N ~ F * t, but I might be getting this wrong. Let me think more carefully.

Signal (counts) is proportional to flux (f) multiplied by exposure time (t), and noise is proportional to sqrt(flux * t). So S/N = (f * t) / sqrt(f * t) ) = sqrt(f * t).

So S/N is sqrt(f * t). But f (flux) depends on the star's apparent magnitude.

Wait, but magnitude m is related to flux via f = f_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where f_0 is a reference flux. So f ∝ 10^(-0.4 m). Therefore, S/N ∝ sqrt(10^(-0.4 m) * t).

Wait, but t is 1 hour. So for each star, S/N scales as 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t). But wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me do it correctly.

f is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m). So S/N = sqrt(f * t) = sqrt( (10^(-0.4 m)) * t ). So S/N = 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t).

Since t is 1 hour, which is a fixed value, the term sqrt(t) is a constant for all stars. So for each star, S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.2 m).

We need S/N ≥10. So 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t) ≥10.

But wait, the exact relation might involve more precise factors, but let's proceed with this approximation.

Assume that the constant (from telescope area, instrument efficiency, etc.) is such that S/N without considering the star's brightness (i.e., the system's capability) can be calculated. But perhaps I should find the maximum magnitude for which S/N is at least 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum magnitude a star can have for ESPRESSO to reach S/N of 10 in 1 hour.

But I'm not certain about the exact numbers, so maybe I can look for the V magnitude limit of ESPRESSO.

Wait, from the ESPRESSO overview page (I don't have it, but I think I remember), ESPRESSO is designed for bright stars since it's a high-resolution spectrograph. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think about the typical S/N achievable. For a 1-hour exposure with a VLT, a star of V=20 might be possible for S/N 10 per pixel, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the stars:

a) Canopus: m_V is about -0.7. So very bright. Definitely S/N is way above 10.

b) Polaris: m_V around 2.0. Also bright, so S/N should be well above 10.

c) m=15: This is a 15th magnitude star. That's pretty dim. Wait, but wait, is that in V band? Yes, the absolute magnitude is given as V magnitude.

At 10 pc, m=15. So the V band flux is 10^(-0.4 * 15) times the reference flux. That's a very faint star, perhaps below what ESPRESSO can achieve in 1 hour.

d) m=21.5: Even fainter, so probably not detectable.

e) m=13.5. Hmm, which is brighter than 15. So maybe detectable? Wait, depends on the system's capability.

f) m=23.5: way too faint.

Wait, what's the typical S/N for a star of V magnitude m when observed with ESPRESSO for 1 hour?

I think that ESPRESSO's sensitivity is such that it can achieve a S/N of 10 per pixel for stars down to around V=20 or maybe even a bit fainter, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's consider that the VLT has a large collecting area. For a star of V=15, would the exposure time of 1 hour provide enough counts?

Another approach: the V magnitude's flux compared to a reference. Let's say that a V=0 star provides a certain number of photons. Each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in flux.

The formula for the number of photons N received from a star is N = (A * eff * QE * t) * (10^(-0.4 (m - m_0)) ) / (exposure time and other factors), but I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the star's brightness compared to the instrument's capabilities.

I can look for the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO. But since I don't have the exact data, perhaps I can make an educated guess.

ESPRESSO is designed for high-resolution spectroscopy, but it's also used for exoplanet studies, which require precise measurements, implying it can handle a range of star brightnesses. But for very faint stars, the S/N might drop below 10.

Wait, another thought: The VLT's 8.2m telescope with ESPRESSO can reach a certain limiting magnitude in 1 hour. Let's say that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N=10 for stars down to about V=20. So any star with m < 20 would be detectable.

Looking at the options:

a) -0.7 → detectable

b) 2.0 → detectable

c) 15 → 15 is brighter than 20? No, 15 is more than 5 magnitudes brighter. Wait no, wait, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So 15 is fainter than 20. Wait no, higher magnitude is fainter. So a star with m=15 is fainter than m=5, for example. Wait, the scale is inverted. So m=15 is very faint, much dimmer than m=5.

But earlier, I thought that for a 1-hour exposure, a star with m=15 would give S/N of 10 or higher. But I'm confused about the actual limit.

Wait, let's think about the relation between S/N and magnitude.

If the S/N is 10 for a star of m=20, then for a star of m=15 (which is 5 magnitudes brighter), the S/N would be higher. Because each magnitude is a factor of ~2.512 in flux. So 5 magnitudes is (2.512)^5 ≈ 98. So the flux is 98 times higher. Since S/N is proportional to sqrt(flux), S/N would be sqrt(98) ≈ 9.9 times higher. So if m=20 gives S/N=10, m=15 would give S/N=10 * 9.9 ≈ 99.

That's way above 10. So any star brighter than m=20 would have S/N >10. So in our options, stars with m ≤20 would be detectable.

Wait, but I'm not sure if m=20 is the correct limit for ESPRESSO. Let me think: the VLT's 8.2m telescope with ESPRESSO. I think ESPRESSO's design allows it to reach S/N=10 for stars as faint as V=20 within a few minutes, but maybe up to V=25 in longer exposures. But for 1 hour, perhaps V=20 is just about achievable.

So let's suppose that the limit is m=20, so any star with m ≤20 would give S/N ≥10.

Now, let's compute each star's m:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.7 → yes

b) Polaris: m≈2.0 → yes

c) 15 → yes (since 15 <20)

d) 21.5 → no

e) 13.5 → yes

f) 23.5 → no

Wait, wait. So a, b, c, e are yes. But wait, I thought the limit is m=20, so stars with m <20 are okay. So:

a) -0.7 → yes

b) 2 → yes

c)15 → yes

d)21.5 → no

e)13.5 → yes

f)23.5 → no

So that's 4 stars (a, b, c, e) that are detectable. But wait, I thought the limit was m=20. So stars with m=15 would be detectable. So that would be 4 stars.

Wait, but the options are a to f, which are 6 stars. So the detectable ones are a, b, c, e. So 4 stars.

But wait, what about the distance? The star in option e is at 5 pc, so m=13.5. That's within the limit.

So that's four stars: a, b, c, e.

Looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the answer should be C)4.

But wait, another thought: the distance affects the star's apparent magnitude, which affects the S/N. But I've already considered that.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the limit. Maybe the limit is lower. Suppose that the maximum S/N is achieved for brighter stars. If the limit is, say, m=18, then some of these stars would not make it.

Wait, but I think for a very high-resolution spectrograph like ESPRESSO, the sensitivity might be lower because it spreads the light into more pixels, reducing the signal per pixel. But in the question, the S/N is per binned pixel. So perhaps the binning increases the S/N.

Wait, the question specifies S/N per binned pixel. So perhaps the binning is accounted for in the calculation, but since it's a 1-hour exposure, the binning would have already considered.

Alternatively, if the spectrograph has a high resolving power, it spreads the light into more pixels, making each pixel's S/N lower. But since the question mentions "binned pixel", perhaps they've combined the pixels, thus increasing the S/N.

But I'm not sure how to factor that into the calculation. For the purpose of this question, perhaps the main thing is to determine the apparent magnitude of each star and then see how many are brighter than the limit (m=20).

So with the assumption that stars with m ≤20 are detectable, the stars a, b, c, e are within that limit, so 4 stars.

But wait, what about the star in option e, which is at 5 pc. Its m=13.5, which is bright enough. So yes.

So the answer would be four stars (options a, b, c, e), so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the star's apparent magnitude, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N scales with the flux of the star, which is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). For a fixed exposure time, the S/N is proportional to \( 10^{-0.2m} \). Assuming ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 for stars with an apparent magnitude of \( m \leq 20 \), we evaluate each star:

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a):** Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This is far above the detectability limit, so it is detectable.

2. **Polaris (b):** Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \), which is also well within the detectability limit.

3. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 0 = 15
   \]  
   This star has an apparent magnitude \( m = 15 \), which is brighter than \( m = 20 \), so it is detectable.

4. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \) (d):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(20) \approx 15 + 6.505 = 21.505
   \]  
   This star has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 21.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 20 \), so it is not detectable.

5. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) \approx 15 - 1.505 = 13.495
   \]  
   This star has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 13.5 \), which is brighter than \( m = 20 \), so it is detectable.

6. **Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \) (f):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) \approx 15 + 3.979 = 18.979
   \]  
   This star has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 19.0 \), which is fainter than \( m = 20 \), so it is not detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), the star at \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \) (c), and the star at \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \) (e). This gives a total of **4 detectable stars**.
