Okay, so I've got this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember from my studies that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like when calculations give infinite results. But I'm a bit rusty on the details, so I'll need to think this through.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I think regularization is a way to handle loop integrals that diverge. Without it, these theories might not make physical sense because you get these infinities popping up. But not all theories need this. 

Starting with Classical Electrodynamics (option D). Oh right, that's the Maxwell's equations and all that. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same kind of infinities. So in classical E&M, you don't get divergent loop diagrams because there are no loops—just point particles moving in fields. So regularization isn't needed here. But wait, the question is about high energies. Does that change anything? I don't think so because high energy in classical physics isn't the same as in quantum theories. So option D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories don't have renormalization issues or divergences that need to be handled?

Looking at Quantum Electrodynamics (QED, option C). I remember QED has problems like the electron mass and charge being infinite unless you renormalize. So QED requires renormalization, which implies it needs regularization—like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So option C is out because the question is about which doesn't require regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD, option B) is the theory of the strong force. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and I think it also has issues with divergences. But wait, maybe because of asymptotic freedom, QCD becomes weak at high energies. So in perturbative calculations, maybe you don't need as much regularization? Or do you still need it? I think even QCD requires renormalization because of loop divergences. So B might still require regularization.

Superstring Theory (option A). I'm a bit less sure about this. Strings are different because they're not point particles. String theories, like superstring theory, have different kinds of interactions. I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "ultraviolet" divergence is different because the theory's perturbative expansion is organized in terms of string loops, not Feynman diagrams. Also, string theories are background-dependent and some might have issues, but I think they don't require the same kind of regularization as QFTs because they're a different approach. Wait, but I also heard that in certain limits, like taking the string tension to zero or something, the theory can reduce to a point particle theory, which would then have the same divergences. But generally, superstring theory doesn't require the same kind of divergence handling as QED or QCD because the underlying formalism is different. So perhaps option A doesn't require regularization.

Wait, so the question is about which one never requires regularization. So which of these theories doesn't have any divergences that require regularization?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Do any of these theories not have divergences? Classical E&M doesn't have quantum divergences because it's not a quantum theory. So its high-energy behavior doesn't require regularization. Because in classical theories, you don't have the same issues with infinities as in quantum theories.

So the options are about high energies. So the theory that doesn't require regularization at high energies is the one that doesn't have these divergences. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, never requires regularization because it's a classical theory without the quantum divergences that necessitate regularization.

Wait, but does high energy in classical theories even make sense? I mean, in reality, at high energies, you'd enter the quantum regime, but the question is about the theories themselves, not their applicability. So the theory itself doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but let me think again. The options are which of the following theories never requires regularization. So:

A) Superstring Theory: Uses regularization? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in some formulations, but perhaps not the same as in QFT.

B) QCD: Requires renormalization, so needs regularization.

C) QED: Requires renormalization, so needs regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: No renormalization needed because it's classical. So yes, it never requires regularization. So the answer is D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on whether they involve divergences that necessitate regularization:

1. **Superstring Theory (A):** Superstring theory is a quantum theory that deals with extended objects (strings) rather than point particles. While it avoids some of the divergences found in quantum field theories due to its unique structure, it still requires regularization in certain formulations, especially when dealing with loop corrections. Thus, it does require regularization in some cases.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (B):** QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, is a quantum field theory that suffers from divergences in loop calculations. These divergences are handled through renormalization, which implies that regularization is necessary. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (C):** QED is a quantum field theory that describes the electromagnetic interaction. It is well-known for requiring renormalization to handle infinities arising from loop integrals. Consequently, regularization is an essential part of QED.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (D):** Classical Electrodynamics, based on Maxwell's equations, is a non-quantum theory. It does not involve the same divergences or infinities that are addressed by regularization in quantum field theories. Since it is a classical theory, it never requires regularization, regardless of energy scales.

Based on this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
