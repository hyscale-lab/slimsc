Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm.

The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and something A, which gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh, right, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones using the Stephen reduction or maybe some kind of substitution. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the reaction of a ketone with a cyanide... I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, there's the benzoin condensation, but that's for aldehydes. Or maybe it's the formation of cyanohydrins? Yeah, I think that's right. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reaction is adding a cyanide across the carbonyl group.

So the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen would get a proton. Then, maybe the proton is from the acid catalyst. So in that case, the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ or maybe something else. So if the first step uses H3O+ as the acid, that would help protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So the product would be a cyanohydrin, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense.

So for reaction A, the reagent is an acid, probably H3O+. So looking at the options, let's see what A options are. Option A: A is H3O+. Option B: A is H3O+. Option C: A is NaHSO3. Option D: A is NaHSO3. So either A or B or C or D. So the first part points towards options A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give the corresponding acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. And it's converting to a carboxylic acid. Oh, right, the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, nitriles typically are oxidized to amides or to carboxylic acids. But in this case, the nitrile is next to an alcohol. So how does that affect things?

Wait, the starting material is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile on adjacent carbons. So when you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you typically use strong oxidizing agents. Like under acidic conditions, maybe KMnO4 or something. But wait, the reagent here is B, which in the options is either HCl (in options A and C) or acetic acid (options B and D). Wait, no, wait the question says for the second reaction, reagent B is H2O? Or is H2O the solvent? Wait, looking back: the question says, for the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the first reaction uses reagent A, the second uses reagent B. So the second reaction is the nitrile compound + B (H2O) gives the acid.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the question: The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So reagent B is H2O, but perhaps in the presence of something else? Or maybe it's the reaction conditions.

Wait, more accurately, the reagent is B, and that's H2O. So the reaction is in water. But how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid in water? Usually, hydrolysis of nitriles is done under acidic or basic conditions. For example, under strong acidic conditions with heat, like H2SO4 and H2O, the nitrile can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get an amide or a carboxylate.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a cyanohydrin. So the molecule has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons. When hydrolyzing the nitrile, perhaps the adjacent hydroxyl group influences the reaction. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are such that the nitrile is oxidized. But wait, oxidation of nitriles typically requires something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the only reagent is B, which is H2O. That doesn't make sense because just water would require some catalyst or acid/base to proceed. Oh wait, perhaps reagent B is something like HCl or another acid. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: for part B, in the options, B is either HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). So the second reaction uses reagent B, which is either HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, the question says that in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O. Hmm, that's confusing. Or maybe I'm misreading it. Let me read the question again.

Ah, wait, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, perhaps I misread that. Maybe B is the reagent, which is H2O, so the reaction is done in water. So perhaps the reaction needs an acid catalyst. So what's the reaction where a nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of water and an acid to form a carboxylic acid?

Yes, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and heat, or perhaps using a catalyst like HgSO4 under acidic conditions. So in this case, if the reagent is H2O and an acid, then perhaps the acid is HCl or acetic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl, options B and D have B as CH3COOH.

But let me think about the first reaction. The first reaction uses reagent A. So A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. If A is H3O+, then the work-up would involve acidic conditions. But if A is NaHSO3, then maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, in the formation of cyanohydrins, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. So for the first step, the reagent is H3O+ (like option A or B), because the acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+. So that would narrow the options to A or B.

Now, for the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So in the presence of H2O and acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze. So if B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic (since HCl is a strong acid). Alternatively, acetic acid is a weak acid. But for hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, strong acid is usually needed, perhaps HCl.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the specific reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), you need to consider the adjacent hydroxyl group.

In such a structure, the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to an alcohol. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you'd get a ketone or a carboxylic acid? Wait, no. Wait, nitriles are R-CN. Upon hydrolysis, they become R-COOH. But if the nitrile is adjacent to an OH group, perhaps the hydrolysis is different. Alternatively, maybe the OH group is part of the same carbon as the CN.

Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So when that's hydrolyzed, perhaps it becomes (CH3)2C(OH)COOH. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid.

So the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, with the adjacent hydroxyl group remaining.

So how is this done? Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, under acidic conditions with H2O and heat, the nitrile would first form an amide, then a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a cyanohydrin. So I'm not sure if that affects the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, another possibility: the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But oxidation of nitriles usually requires a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. HCl is a strong acid, so maybe that's the case. Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, it's a weaker acid. But I'm not sure if that would be sufficient.

Wait, let's think about each option. Let's take each option and see if the reagents fit the reactions.

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

So first reaction: butanone + NaCN in H3O+ → cyanohydrin. That makes sense.

Second reaction: nitrile compound + HCl (as B) in H2O. Hmm. Wait, but in the problem statement, the second reaction is using B as H2O. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Let me look again.

Wait, the question says: for the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps B is the solvent, but the actual reagent is something else. Or maybe in the reaction, the reagent B is H2O. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, the way the question is written, the first reaction uses A, the second uses B. So in the first reaction: butanone + NaCN + A → product. So A is a reagent. Second reaction: (nitrile compound) + B (H2O) → product. So B is H2O, but maybe in the presence of another reagent, like an acid.

Wait, no, the question says "reagent B (H2O)" which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's indicating that B is H2O as the solvent, and the reagent is something else. Or perhaps the reagent is H2O with another condition.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the options. Let's look at each option.

Option A: A = H3O+; B=HCl.

So first reaction: NaCN and H3O+ as reagents. Makes sense for cyanohydrin formation.

Second reaction: B is HCl. So the second reaction is in HCl and H2O. If the nitrile is in HCl and H2O, perhaps it's hydrolyzing. But HCl would provide the acidic condition. Wait, but if B is HCl, then the reagent is HCl, and the solvent is H2O. So HCl is the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid.

But wait, in the second reaction, the reagent for the reaction is B, which is HCl. So the reagents are NaCN and A for the first, and B for the second, which is HCl.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the second reaction is set up. Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is in H2O with HCl as the catalyst. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed under acidic conditions with HCl.

So in that case, the nitrile group would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So that would make sense, as the product is the carboxylic acid.

So option A could be correct.

Now, looking at option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH.

Wait, so for the first reaction, would NaHSO3 work? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm trying to recall what reactions that's used for. Sodium bisulfite is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is an addition of CN- across the carbonyl. So perhaps if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^-.

Wait, but the reaction of ketones with HCN (which would give the cyanohydrin) typically uses an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+. So I don't think NaHSO3 would be appropriate for that. Because HCN is a weak acid, and the reaction is usually acid-catalyzed.

So, probably, option D is not correct because reagent A is NaHSO3, which I don't think would work for the first step.

Similarly, option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So same issue with the first reaction.

So for the first reaction, options A and B are more plausible.

Now, for the second reaction, let's think about what B is.

Option A: B is HCl.

So the second reaction would be in HCl (as B) and H2O as solvent. Under these conditions, would the nitrile hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid? I think that's possible. Because HCl is a strong acid, and in H2O, the nitrile would undergo hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid. So that seems viable.

Option B: B is CH3COOH.

So the second reaction uses B as acetic acid (CH3COOH) in H2O. Would that be sufficient for hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid. Hmm. The hydrolysis of nitriles usually requires more vigorous conditions, like strong acid and heat. So maybe acetic acid alone isn't enough. So perhaps option B is not correct.

So that leaves option A as a possible correct answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, another thought: the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. That would require an oxidation. So perhaps the reagent is an oxidizing agent in an acidic solution.

Wait, but in the options, B is either an acid or acetic acid. So in that case, perhaps the nitrile is being oxidized. But oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 or others.

Wait, but the options don't have any oxidizing agents. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis, not an oxidation.

Wait, but nitriles can also be hydrolyzed to amides and then to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. So perhaps in the presence of H2O and acid, the nitrile is hydrolyzed.

So, if B is HCl, then it's providing the acidic environment for the hydrolysis. So that would make sense.

Therefore, for the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+, and for the second, HCl. So option A.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Which matches what I thought.

Wait, but let me double-check the options again.

Yes, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin) in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN⁻) under acidic conditions. The acid catalyst (H₃O⁺) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and allowing CN⁻ to attack. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, specifically H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) provides the necessary acidic environment for this reaction, making it the suitable reagent for the second reaction.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation).  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction (nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid).  
  - This option is correct.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and may not provide sufficient acidic conditions for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.  
  - This option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation.  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
  - This option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid and may not be sufficient for the second reaction.  
  - This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as they satisfy the requirements for both reactions.

Answer: A
