Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and it's a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can figure it out by thinking aloud.

Alright, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So Y is some element that forms multiple binary compounds with F. Five of these are known, so Y must be a common element that can form five different binary fluorides. Hmm, fluorine usually has a valency of -1, so the other element Y would have varying positive valencies.

The substances are labeled A1 to A5. Let me parse what each of these does.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, like 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction probably releases F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is an oxidizing agent, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so A1 might be a fluoride that's a strong oxidizing agent when it breaks down.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So maybe A3 is the most fluorinated form of Y. For example, if Y is chlorine, the most fluorinated would be ClF3 or something, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Hmm, adding Y to a solution of A4 gives A5. Also, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So A5 is probably a salt, and when it dissolves in water, it breaks down into two products. Maybe a decomposition reaction.

The question is about the molecular weight of A4. The options are ranges, so I need to figure out what A4 is.

Let me think about possible Y. Since Y forms five binary fluorides, what elements have five common fluorides? Let me think. Maybe chlorine? Wait, chlorine's common fluorides include ClF, ClF3, ClF5? Wait, no, chlorine can form ClF3 and ClF5, but how many binary compounds? Hmm, maybe chlorine has more. Wait, another option: sulfur? No, sulfur's fluorides aren't as common. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen? No, oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2, but that's only two. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is nitrogen? Nitrogen has NF3 and maybe others, but not five. Alternatively, phosphorus? Let's see, phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, maybe others. Wait, PF3 and PF5 are the main ones, but that's two. Hmm, maybe Y is a halogen? Like chlorine. Let me think about chlorine's fluorides.

Wait, chlorines possible fluorides are ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three, but the question says five. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Wait, what about carbon? Carbon forms CF4, but that's only one. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is iodine? Iodine can form IF, IF3, IF5. That's three again. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Wait, perhaps Y is another element. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal, but that's less likely because binary compounds with F are more common with nonmetals.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen. Oh, wait, OF2 and O2F2 are two, but that's only two. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, when the problem says 'five binary compounds of fluorine with Y are known,' perhaps Y is an element that can form multiple different fluorides with varying F:Y ratios. For example, perhaps Y is chlorine, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about each A1 to A5 and see what they might be.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of F?) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, oF probably refers to oxidation state? Or maybe it's the formula. Wait, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in A2.

If A2 has oF (fluorine) at 31.96%, then let's calculate the formula. Let's say the formula is YF_x. The percentage by mass of F is 31.96%. Let's calculate molar mass.

Assume the formula is YF_x. Let molar mass of Y be M. Then, (x*19)/(M + 19x) = 0.3196.

But without knowing x, it's tricky. Let me think of possible fluorides where F is about 32% by mass.

Wait, perhaps it's ClF3. Cl has a molar mass of about 35.5. So 3 F atoms would be 3*19=57. So total molar mass is 35.5 + 57 = 92.5. F% is 57/92.5 ≈ 61.6%. Hmm, that's higher than 32%. Hmm, maybe another compound.

What about ClF? Cl is 35.5, F is 19. So total 54.5. F% is 19/54.5 ≈ 34.8%. Close to 31.96%. Hmm, but 34.8% is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element.

Wait, maybe Y is sulfur. Let me check. Suppose A2 is SF4. Sulfur is 32, F is 19. So formula SF4: molar mass is 32 + 4*19 = 32+76=108. F mass is 76, so 76/108 ≈ 70.37%. Not 32%.

Alternatively, SF2: 32 + 38 = 70. F% is 38/70 ≈54.2%. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. 31.96% F by mass. Let's say the formula is YF. Then, F is 19/(M_Y +19) = 0.3196. Solving for M_Y: 19 = 0.3196*(M_Y +19). 19 = 0.3196 M_Y + 6.0724. 19 -6.0724 = 0.3196 M_Y → 12.9276 = 0.3196 M_Y → M_Y ≈40.5 g/mol. So Y would have a molar mass around 40.5. What element is that? Titanium is about 48, not exactly. Maybe it's not YF.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF3. Then F% is (3*19)/(M_Y + 57) )= 0.3196. So 57 = 0.3196*(M_Y +57). 57 / 0.3196 ≈ 178. So M_Y +57 ≈ 178 → M_Y ≈121. Hmm, that's too high. No, because Y is probably a lighter element.

Wait, maybe Y is chlorine. Let's try Y=Cl, and formula ClF. Then Cl is 35.5, F is 19. So 19/(35.5+19)=19/54.5≈34.8% as earlier. Close to 31.96% but not exact. Maybe another element.

Wait, maybe Y is sodium. Sodium's molar mass is about 23. Let's see. If formula is NaF: 19/(23+19)=19/42≈45.2% F. Not close. If formula is NaF3? Wait, sodium typically has a +1 charge, so F would be -1 each. So formula would be NaF. But maybe if it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Let's see. Let's say formula is PF. So F% is 19/(31 +19) =19/50=38% F. Close, but not 32%. Hmm. Maybe PF3? Molar mass 31 + 3*19=88. F% is 57/88≈64.7%. No, that's too high.

Wait, perhaps Y is something else. Let me think if there's a fluoride where F is about 32% by mass.

Wait, maybe it's ClF3. Wait, earlier I thought ClF3 has F% around 61%, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is YF2. Then F% is (2*19)/(M_Y +38) = 0.3196. So 38 = 0.3196*(M_Y +38). Let me compute:

38 / 0.3196 ≈ 118.85 → M_Y +38 ≈118.85 → M_Y≈80.85 g/mol. That's around the atomic mass of lead (Pb is ~207), but maybe not. Wait, what element has a molar mass around 80? Maybe strontium is ~87, or yttrium ~89, or maybe something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe YF4. So F% is (4*19)/(M_Y +76) = 0.3196. So 76=0.3196*(M_Y +76). 76 / 0.3196 ≈237.5 → M_Y +76≈237.5 → M_Y ≈161.5. That's way too high, probably not.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is ClF3? Because I know ClF3 is a known compound. Let me see, ClF3's molar mass is 35.5 + 3*19 = 35.5 +57=92.5. F% is 57/92.5≈61.6%. Which is higher than 31.96%. So that can't be it.

Wait, maybe A2 is OF2. O is about 16. So molar mass is 16 + 38=54. F% is 38/54 ≈70.37%, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A2 is something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a chloride or fluoride but another compound. Maybe a different approach is needed.

Let me think about A1. A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a strong fluorinating agent that releases F2 when it decomposes.

Wait, perhaps A1 is ClF3. Because ClF3 is a strong fluorinating agent. When it decomposes, maybe it breaks down into ClF (A2) and fluorine? Let me think: 4 ClF3 → Cl2 + 6 F2 + 3 O2? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2 ClF3 → 2 ClF + F2. Let me check the stoichiometry.

Wait, ClF3 decomposes perhaps into ClF and F2. Let me write the equation: 4 ClF3 → 4 ClF + 3 F2. That would balance the fluorine: 4*3=12 F on the left; 4*1 + 3*2=4+6=10. Hmm, not balanced. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition reaction of ClF3 is: 4 ClF3 → 2 Cl2 + 3 F2. Let me count F: 4*3=12 on left. Right: 3*2=6. Doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong about A1 being ClF3.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF5. ClF5 is a known compound. Does it decompose into something and F2? Let me think: ClF5 → ClF3 + F2? Let's balance. Let's say 2 ClF5 → 2 ClF3 + F2. Left: 2 Cl, 10 F. Right: 2 Cl, 6 F + 2 F =8 F. Not balanced. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a more complex compound. Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF and F2. Let's see: 2 YF3 → 2 YF + F2. Let's balance. 2 YF3 → 2 YF + F2. Y: 2 on each side. F: 6 on left, 2 + 2=4 on right. Not balanced. So 4 YF3 → 4 YF + 2 F2. That would balance F: 12 → 4 +4=8. Still not. Hmm.

Maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me move on and see if other parts can give me clues.

A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So A3 is the most fluorinated form of Y. For example, if Y is chlorine, A3 could be ClF3 or ClF5.

A3 can also interact with xenon. Xenon is inert, so perhaps A3 is a strong enough oxidizing agent to react with xenon. Fluorine can react with xenon under certain conditions, but maybe A3 is a higher fluoride that can do that.

Then, when Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. So, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride, and adding Y metal would cause a reaction, maybe a displacement reaction.

For example, if A4 is a solution of Y'F, and adding Y (metal) would displace Y' from the solution, forming YF and Y'. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt, and adding Y causes a reaction that forms A5. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base, or something similar.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of YF3 in water. When Y is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF and another product. For example, YF3 + Y → 2 YF. But that would require a 1:1 molar ratio. So perhaps Y reacts with YF3 as follows: Y (s) + YF3 (aq) → 2 YF2 (aq). Wait, but fluorides usually have a 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y gives YF3. Wait, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, if adding Y metal to a solution of A4 (which is a fluoride) produces A5, perhaps it's a reduction reaction. For example, Y in elemental form might reduce a higher fluoride to a lower one. So, for example, adding Y metal to YF5 might produce YF3 and YF.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where Y metal displaces F from a fluoride. For example, if A4 is YF5, adding Y would produce YF3 and YF. Let's think: Y (s) + YF5 → 2 YF3. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Then, when A5 is dissolved in water, it decomposes into two substances. Perhaps A5 is a salt that is not stable in water. For example, if A5 is YF, which might hydrolyze. Let me think: YF + H2O → Y(OH)F + HF. Or maybe YF decomposes into YO and F2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a diatomic molecule that breaks into two parts. Hmm.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think of Y as chlorine. Let's see if that makes sense.

If Y is chlorine, then the five binary fluorides would be ClF, ClF3, ClF5, and perhaps others. Wait, actually, chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, and ClF5. That's three, but the question says five. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen. Then, the fluorides would be OF2 and O2F2. Only two, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is nitrogen. Nitrogen's fluorides include NF3 and perhaps others, but again, not five.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4, SF6, maybe others. SF2, perhaps. That's three, not five.

Alternatively, maybe Y is carbon. Then, CF4 is a common one, but that's only one.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe Y is a transition metal that can form multiple fluorides. For example, tin can form SnF2, SnF4, etc. Alternatively, lead forms PbF2, PbF4. But I'm not certain about the count.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sodium. Sodium forms NaF, which is a simple fluoride. Not sure about multiple fluorides.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about A4. The problem says that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. The solution is colorless. If A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, then adding Y (metal) might cause a reaction.

For example, if A4 is AlF3 solution, adding Al metal would not react because Al is more reactive and would displace Al from its salts, but AlF3 is not typically a solution in water because it's amphoteric. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of YF3. When Y metal is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF and another product. Let's write the equation: Y (s) + YF3 → 2 YF. That would be a 1:1 molar ratio. Then, YF (which is YF) would be A5.

When A5 (YF) is dissolved in water, it might hydrolyze. For example, YF + H2O → Y(OH)F + HF. But if Y is a metal, Y(OH)F might not be stable and could decompose further. Alternatively, perhaps YF decomposes into Y and F2, but that seems unlikely.

But considering the decomposition of A5 into two substances, perhaps it's a reaction where YF breaks into Y and F. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4. Adding Y would produce YF3. Then, A5 would be YF3. When YF3 is dissolved in water, perhaps it hydrolyzes: YF3 + 3 H2O → Y(OH)3 + 3 HF. But Y(OH)3 would be a precipitate, and HF is a gas, but the problem states that A5 decomposes into two substances. Maybe YF3 decomposes into Y and F2? Not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the options given for the molecular weight of A4.

Options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So I need to find which range includes the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is a fluoride of Y, then its molecular weight would be Y's atomic weight plus fluorine's contribution. For example, if Y is chlorine (atomic weight ~35.5) and A4 is ClF3, then molecular weight is 35.5 + 3*19= 35.5+57=92.5. That's way below the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a more complex compound. Maybe it's a polyatomic fluoride, like YF5. For Y=Cl, ClF5 would have molecular weight 35.5 +5*19=35.5+95=130.5. That's within option D (110-130). But let me see if that fits the other clues.

If A4 is ClF5, then adding Cl metal (Y=Cl) in a 1:1 ratio would be Cl (s) + ClF5 → product. Hmm, but Cl is less reactive than F, so I'm not sure if that reaction would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is ClF5 + Cl → 2 ClF3. Let me check the stoichiometry. 1 ClF5 + 1 Cl → 2 ClF3. So ClF5 + Cl → 2 ClF3. That balances Cl (1 +1 on each side) and F (5 on left, 6 on right). Hmm, not balanced. Maybe 2 ClF5 + 2 Cl → 4 ClF3 + F2. Let me count: Cl: 2 +2=4 on right; F: 10 on left, 12 on right. Not balanced. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. Let's say Y is sulfur. Then, A4 would be SF4, which has a molecular weight of 32 +4*19=32+76=108. That's within option D (110-130), but 108 is just below. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A4 is YF3 where Y is phosphorus. So P has a molar mass of ~31. So YF3 would be 31 +3*19=31+57=88. That's too low. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is germanium. Germanium has a molar mass of about 72. If A4 is GeF4, then molecular weight is 72 +4*19=72+76=148. That's within option A (140-160). Hmm, that's a possible range.

But wait, let's see if that fits with the other clues. If Y is germanium, then the five binary fluorides would be GeF2, GeF4, GeF6, and maybe others. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact number of known fluorides for germanium.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine. Iodine forms IF, IF3, IF5. That's three, but maybe more. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, let me think about the decomposition of A1. If A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2, perhaps A1 is a diatomic molecule. Wait, fluorine is F2, which is a diatomic gas. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a bright greenish-yellow gas, I think, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is O2F2, which is a pale yellow gas. Not sure.

Wait, maybe A1 is FCl, but I don't think that's a stable compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a more complex fluoride, like YF5. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the molecular weight options again.

If the correct option is C) 160-180, that would suggest a molecular weight in that range. Let's see what compounds have that. For example, if Y is iodine (I, ~127), then I F5 would have molar mass 127 +5*19=127+95=222. That's in option B (220-240). Hmm.

But then, when Y is added to A4 (which is IF5?), would that produce something else? I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility. If Y is chlorine, and A4 is ClF5 (molar mass 35.5 +5*19=35.5+95=130.5). That's within option D (110-130). Then, when Cl (Y) is added, perhaps it reacts to form ClF3 and F2.

But I'm not sure about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF3, molar mass 92.5, which is below option D's lower limit of 110. So that may not fit.

Alternatively, let's consider A4 as YF4. If Y is sulfur (32), then SF4 has molar mass 32 +4*19=32+76=108. That's just under option D's 110-130. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is molybdenum or another transition metal, but I'm not sure about their fluorides' properties.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a salt, not a simple fluoride. For example, maybe it's YF3·nH2O or something. But considering the molar mass, perhaps that's more complex.

Wait, another angle. When A4 is a hot, concentrated solution, perhaps it's a solution of a highly fluorinated compound, like YF5. Let me imagine Y is chlorine again. So A4 is ClF5 solution. Adding Cl metal would perhaps displace F, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. Then, adding Y would produce YF. Let's say Y is chlorine. ClF3 + Cl → 2 ClF. So the molar ratio is 1:1. Then, A5 would be ClF. So the molecular weight of A4 (ClF3) is 35.5 +57=92.5, which is below all options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for another approach.

The question is about the molecular weight of A4. Let's think of common fluorides that fit into the given options.

Option C is 160-180. So a compound with molecular weight around 160 would be, for example, ClF5 (as before, 130.5), which is too low. Alternatively, maybe it's something like YF4 where Y has a higher atomic weight. Let's say Y is about 160 - (4*19) = 160-76=84. So Y would have a molar mass around 84. That's near the atomic mass of oxygen (16), but that's way lower. Hmm, perhaps Y is a transition metal.

Wait, 160-180. Let me compute what Y would be for a formula YF3. YF3 → molar mass Y + 57= between 160-180 → Y=103-123. So Y would be around 115. That's close to the atomic mass of tin (Sn is about 118.71). So SnF3 would have a molar mass of 118.71 + 57=175.71, which is within option C (160-180). Hmm, so could Y be tin?

If Y is tin, then the five binary fluorides would include SnF2, SnF4, SnF6, and others. But I'm not sure about the exact number.

If A4 is SnF4, then its molar mass is 118.71 +4*19=118.71+76=194.71. That's above option C (160-180). So that's not a fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF2. Molar mass would be 118.71 +38=156.71. That's within option C. So if A4 is SnF2, then when Sn is added, perhaps it reacts to form SnF.

Wait, but SnF2 is a known compound. Adding Sn metal to SnF2 solution would perhaps not react because Sn is less oxidizing. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead (Pb, ~207). Then, PbF2 would have molar mass 207 +38=245, which is above option C.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about A1.

A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's typically unreactive, but under certain conditions, it can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. So if A1 is a strong fluorinating agent, maybe it's FCl (but I don't think FCl is a stable compound).

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent and can react with noble gases. Does ClF3 oxidize xenon? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's possible.

If A1 is ClF3, then when it decomposes, it might break down into ClF and F2. Let's see: 4 ClF3 → 2 Cl2 + 3 F2? Wait, but that would produce Cl2 and F2, but where does the ClF come in? Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is 4 ClF3 → 4 ClF + 2 F2. Let's check the F balance: 4*3=12 F on left; 4*1 + 2*2=4+4=8 F on right. Not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the decomposition is 2 ClF3 → 2 ClF + F2. Let's see: 2*3=6 F on left; 2*1 + 2=4 F on right. Still not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 4 ClF3 → 2 ClF2 + 2 F2. Let's check F: 4*3=12 on left; 2*2 + 2*2=4+4=8 on right. Still not balanced. Hmm.

Maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think again about the initial steps.

Perhaps the key lies in A5 decomposing into two substances when in water. If A5 is YF, then in water, YF might hydrolyze to Y(OH)F and HF. But maybe Y is a metal that reacts more vigorously, leading to the formation of a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a salt that breaks into a metal and a non-metal. Like, for example, if A5 is NaF, and when dissolved in water, it dissociates into Na+ and F- ions. But that's not decomposition; it's dissociation.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A5 is YF, and when it decomposes, it forms Y and F2. But that would require high energy, and I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is something like HOF, but that's not a fluoride.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the options again. The correct answer is likely to be option C (160-180), but I'm not entirely certain. Or maybe option A (140-160) is the right range.

Wait, let me think about the given options. If A4 is a binary compound of Y and F, and the molecular weight is in one of these ranges, perhaps the correct answer is option C (160-180). Let me see: if Y is tin, then SnF4 would be 118.71 +76=194.71, which is above 180, so not in C. SnF3 is 118.71 +57=175.71, which is within C. So if A4 is SnF3, then the molecular weight is about 175.71, which fits in option C.

But I'm not sure if SnF3 is a known compound. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A4 is CaF2. Calcium fluoride has a molar mass of 40 + 2*19=78, which is way below the options. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is BaF2. Barium has a molar mass of about 137.33. So BaF2 is 137.33 +38=175.33. That's within option C (160-180). Hmm, that's a possibility.

So if A4 is BaF2, then when Ba is added, perhaps it reacts with BaF2 to form BaF. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Ba is already in the compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, if the solution is hot and concentrated, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. For example, BaF2 is sparingly soluble in water and may hydrolyze to form Ba(OH)2 and HF. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps adding Ba metal to BaF2 solution would not react, as Ba is a metal and BaF2 is a salt where Ba is already in +2 oxidation state.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Another idea: perhaps A4 is YF5, where Y has a molar mass that makes the total around 160-180. Let's compute: YF5 → Y +5*19= Y +95. So Y would be around 160-180-95=65-85. So Y would be around 77, which is indium (In). Hmm, but I'm not sure if InF5 is a known compound.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is tin (Sn, ~118.71), so SnF5 would be 118.71 +95=213.71, which is in option B (220-240). Hmm, but 213.71 is just below option B's lower limit. So that might not fit.

Wait, another element with a molar mass around 160-180 for a compound: perhaps Y is tellurium (Te, ~128). Then, TeF4 would have a molar mass of 128 +76=204, which is in option B (220-240) but again a bit low.

Alternatively, TeF6 would be 128 +114=242, which is within option B. But the question is about A4's molecular weight, so I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me make a guess based on the options and the possible compounds.

Given that option C is 160-180, and considering that Y could be tin (Sn) where SnF3 has a molar mass of about 175.71, which is within this range, I'll tentatively think that the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y are known, and the question provides clues about the properties and transformations of substances A1 to A5.

### Key Analysis:
1. **A1 and A2**: A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). A2 has fluorine accounting for 31.96% of its mass. This suggests A2 could be a fluoride with the formula YFₓ, where the fluorine percentage aligns with its molar mass.

2. **A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can interact with xenon. This indicates A3 is a highly fluorinated form of Y, possibly YF₅ or YF₃, depending on Y's valency.

3. **A4 and A5**: A4 is a hot, concentrated, colorless solution. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4 produces A5, which decomposes into two substances in water. This suggests A4 is likely a fluoride salt, such as YF₃ or YF₅, and A5 could be a simpler fluoride or a hydrolysis product.

4. **Molecular Weight of A4**: The options provided are:
   - A) 140-160
   - B) 220-240
   - C) 160-180
   - D) 110-130

   Considering the properties of known fluorides and their molecular weights:
   - If Y is tin (Sn, ~118.71), SnF₃ has a molecular weight of 118.71 + 57 = 175.71, which falls within the range of option C (160-180).
   - Other elements like chlorine (Cl, ~35.5) or sulfur (S, ~32) result in fluorides with molecular weights outside the given ranges when combined with fluorine.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible molecular weight range for A4 is 160-180, corresponding to option C.
