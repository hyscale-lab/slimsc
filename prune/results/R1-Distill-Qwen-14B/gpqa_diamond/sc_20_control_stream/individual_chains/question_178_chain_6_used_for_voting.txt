Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's start by understanding the given Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices.

I think the first step is to find the mass dimension of each field and term in the Lagrangian. I know that in the Standard Model, the fields have specific mass dimensions. Fermion fields like ψ typically have a mass dimension of 3/2 because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in 4 spacetime dimensions. So, ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2, and ψ̄ (the adjoint) also has the same dimension.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Since σ_{μν} is made from commutators of γ matrices, it's just a constant in terms of mass dimension. So, [σ_{μν}]_M = 0.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like the electromagnetic field. I think F has a mass dimension of 2 because the field tensor is the derivative of the gauge field A, and each derivative brings in mass dimension 1. So, since F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, each A has dimension 1, so F would be [∂ A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Putting it all together: the term in the Lagrangian is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Wait, so the product of fields is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let me compute the mass dimension of each part. ψ̄ has 3/2, ψ has 3/2, σ is 0. So ψ̄ σ ψ has (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F is 2, so the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has 3 + 2 =5? But wait, the Lagrangian term L has to have mass dimension 4 because in four dimensions, the action is integral of L, which is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have [L]_M =4.

So, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has to have dimension 4. Let's compute the dimension of the term: [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = [κ] + (3/2 +3/2) = [κ] +3 +2= [κ] +5. Wait, that's incorrect because I think I misapplied it.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is ψ̄ (which is dimension 3/2) multiplied by ψ (3/2), so 3/2 +3/2 =3. Then multiplied by F (dimension 2), so 3+2=5. So the product without κ has dimension 5. Then κ is multiplied to get the term to have dimension 4, because the Lagrangian is dimension 4.

So, the term is κ * (something with dimension 5). So the entire term must be dim 4. Therefore, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, for renormalizability: The interaction term involves fields with certain dimensions. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤4. If it's equal to 4, it's renormalizable; if higher, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, in this case, our term is L_int=κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The dimension of the term is [κ] +5= -1 +5=4. So the term itself is dimension 4. But wait, no, the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4.

Wait, but the question is about whether the theory is renormalizable. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the interaction terms must have mass dimension ≤4, and the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension (or zero, because a dimensionless coupling can still be renormalizable, but wait, no: in 4D, a renormalizable interaction requires that the coupling has dimension ≥0? No, wait, the general rule is that the coupling's dimension is [g]_M = 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). So for each term in the Lagrangian, if the sum of the fields' dimensions is D, then the coupling's dimension is 4 - D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The dimension of the term in the Lagrangian must be 4, because the action is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

In the interaction term, the coupling is κ, and the rest of the term's product of fields has dimension 5. So [L]_M = [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1. So [κ]_M =-1.

But for renormalizability, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has a positive mass dimension. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, in 4 dimensions, renormalizable theories have couplings with dimension ≤0? No, wait, no. Let me think. The mass dimension of a coupling determines the superficial degree of divergence in Feynman diagrams. For a coupling [g]_M = d, if d>0, the theory is superrenormalizable. If d=0, it's renormalizable. If d<0, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, that's the key point. Right, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of external legs' dimensions) + (couplings' dimensions summed over vertices). Wait, no, perhaps a simpler way is to think about the dimension of the coupling and the interaction term.

In this case, the interaction term is dimension 4. The coupling κ has dimension -1. Since the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction term has higher than 4 dimensions? Wait no, because the Lagrangian term is already of dimension 4, which is okay.

Wait, no. The mass dimension of the coupling is [κ]_M = -1. Now, when you have a term like κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is part of the Lagrangian. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Since the term without κ has dimension 5, κ must be dimension -1 to bring it down to 4.

But for renormalizability, the coupling must have a mass dimension ≥0. Because if [g]_M <0, then as the energy scale increases, the coupling becomes stronger, leading to possible non-predictive behavior at high energies.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term should have dimension ≤4. Since the term here is dimension 4, which is the maximum for renormalizability. So if the term is dimension 4, then the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, but the coupling's dimension is [κ]_M = -1. So the term is dimension 4, which is okay. But the coupling has negative dimension. So the theory would be non-renormalizable? Because I think that in four dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The condition for renormalizability is that the coupling's dimension is ≥0. Because the dimension tells you how the coupling behaves under scaling. If [g]_M is negative, then each time you go to a higher energy scale, the coupling becomes larger. So the theory becomes strongly coupled at high energies, making perturbation theory invalid. Hence, it's non-renormalizable.

So in this case, since [κ]_M =-1, which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option A is [κ]=-1 and renormalizable, which would be incorrect. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint field $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$, as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$ with $[A_\mu]_M = 1$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from commutators of dimensionless gamma matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian is dimensionless in 4 spacetime dimensions. The total mass dimension of the fields is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, the coupling $\kappa$ has $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the coupling grows stronger at higher energy scales, making the theory non-renormalizable. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:
