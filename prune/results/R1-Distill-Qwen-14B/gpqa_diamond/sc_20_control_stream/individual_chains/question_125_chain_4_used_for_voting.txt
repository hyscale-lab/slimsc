Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, right? The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Hmm, I think that's the harmonic oscillator potential because it looks similar to the potential for a harmonic oscillator in one dimension, extended to three dimensions.

So the problem is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that in three dimensions, the harmonic oscillator is often treated as three independent one-dimensional oscillators, each in the x, y, and z directions. But wait, no, actually, in three dimensions, it's a 3D isotropic oscillator, so the energy levels are different. Oh right, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, but for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. Or wait, no. Let me think again. In three dimensions, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. Or maybe it's based on the principal quantum number in spherical coordinates.

No, wait. In the case of a 3D isotropic oscillator, you can use either Cartesian coordinates or spherical coordinates. In Cartesian, each direction has its own quantum number, say nx, ny, nz. The energy would be E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

But wait, in spherical coordinates, the energy levels might be grouped differently. Oh, but wait, the Hamiltonian for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is spherically symmetric, so it's better to use the quantum numbers in terms of the angular momentum and the radial part. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Actually, the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved in Cartesian coordinates, where each direction is a 1D oscillator. So the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. So each direction has quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, which are non-negative integers. The energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, when using spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the sum n = nx + ny + nz, so the energy levels are E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = 0,1,2,... So each energy level is determined by the sum n.

Wait, but the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. So for each n, the number of states with that sum is given by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers, which is the combination with repetition. But that's for the degeneracy, the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy.

So the problem is about the third excited state. Hmm, what's the ground state, then the first excited, etc.

Wait, the ground state is n=0, because that's the lowest energy. Then the first excited state is n=1, because that's the next higher energy. The second excited state would be higher than that, so n=2, and the third excited state would be n=3.

Wait, no, wait. Ground state is the lowest possible energy, which is n=0. The first excited state would be the next level, which is n=1. The second excited state is n=2, and the third excited would be n=3.

So the energy would be E = (n + 3/2) ħω. For n=3, that's (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's part of the answer.

Now, how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy? That's the degeneracy. The degeneracy for each level is given by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three integers (nx, ny, nz), each ≥0. So for n=3, the number of possible (nx, ny, nz) triplets where nx + ny + nz =3.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = n is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, that would be (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: for the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω. The number of states with energy E is the number of ways to get n = nx + ny + nz, which is (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, it's (3+2 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So looking at the options, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. So option A says (9/2) ħω, 10.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to look at it is that in 3D, each state is labeled by quantum numbers (nx, ny, nz). The ground state is (0,0,0), so n=0. The first excited state could have one of the quantum numbers as 1, others 0, so (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three states, but wait, no, that's the first excited level, but it's for n=1, so E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω.

Wait, no, the third excited state is n=3, which gives E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So the energy part is correct.

So the options: option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. Option C is (9/2) ħω, 3. So option A is correct for the energy and the degeneracy.

Wait, but another thing: in some contexts, the principal quantum number in 3D might be different. Oh wait, no. The 3D isotropic oscillator is a special case where each energy level is non-degenerate in the radial part but the angular part contributes. Wait, no, wait. No, I'm mixing this up with hydrogen-like atoms. In the 3D oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers, not on the angular momentum quantum number l. So the energy is the same for all states with the same sum n = nx + ny + nz.

So for n=3, the number of states is 10. So the correct answer would be option A: (9/2) ħω, 10.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = (n + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three Cartesian directions. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways to write $n$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, which is given by the combinatorial formula $\binom{n+2}{2}$.

For the third excited state, the quantum number $n$ is 3 (since the ground state corresponds to $n=0$, the first excited state to $n=1$, the second to $n=2$, and the third to $n=3$). The energy of this state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of this energy level is the number of ways to distribute $n=3$ among the three quantum numbers $n_x, n_y, n_z$. Using the formula $\binom{n+2}{2}$, the degeneracy is:

\[
\binom{3+2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$**
