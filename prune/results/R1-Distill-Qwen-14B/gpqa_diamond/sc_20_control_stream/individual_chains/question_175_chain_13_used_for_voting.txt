Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. The question is asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the form of f as a function of lambda.

The options are A through D, each with a fraction and a lambda dependence. I need to pick the correct pair.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric along z, it's probably similar to a dipole radiation situation. Wait, though, a dipole is usually a different shape, maybe like a dumbbell, but the principles might be similar.

I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is a classic example. Oh right, the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta relative to the dipole's axis. The formula for the power pattern is something like P proportional to (sin^2(theta)) / (something), but wait, the exact dependence?

Wait, the power per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) for an oscillating dipole is given by the formula (p^2 omega^4 sin^2(theta)) / (c^3 epsilon_0) or something like that. But when considering the far field (radiation zone), the power per unit solid angle (also known as the directivity) for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum occurs when theta is 90 degrees, because sin(theta) is 1 there. At theta=0 or 180, it's zero.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees. So the maximum is at theta=90, and we need the fraction at 30.

But wait, the function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So for a dipole, f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum is when sin(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=90 degrees, f_max = sin^2(90) = 1.

The fraction at theta=30 would be f(theta)/f_max. So f(30)/f_max = sin^2(30)/1. Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction of A at 30 degrees is 1/4. So that narrows down the options.

Looking at the options, which options have 1/4 as the fraction? Options B and C. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now the second part is the form of f as a function of lambda. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta), but wait, that's the angular dependence. The question says f is a function of lambda and theta. So what's the dependence of the radiation power on wavelength?

I remember that the power radiated by an oscillating charge (like in an antenna) depends on the acceleration. For a dipole, the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration, which in turn depends on the frequency. The power also depends on the fourth power of the frequency because of the fields' dependence.

Wait, the radiated power P is proportional to (e^2 a^2)/m c^3, but maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, the average power radiated by a dipole is given by P_avg = ( (e^2 omega^4 ) / (6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ) * ... something with the charge and the dipole moment.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the radiation formula. The power radiated by an oscillating charge (assuming it's a dipole) has P proportional to omega^4. Since omega is 2pi over the period, and the wavelength lambda is c/f, and f is the frequency, so omega = 2pi f. So omega is proportional to c/lambda.

Wait, because c = lambda * f, so f = c / lambda. So omega = 2pi c / lambda.

So substituting omega into the expression for P: P ~ omega^4 = (c^4)/(lambda^4). So f, which is the power per unit solid angle, would also have this lambda dependence. Because f is the radiation pattern, which is P divided by the total power, but in this case, the question says f is the power per unit solid angle, which already accounts for the direction. Wait, no, wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So if the total power is A (maximum), then f(theta) would be (some proportion) * sin^2(theta) * something with lambda.

Wait, perhaps the function f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta) multiplied by (1/lambda^4). Because the power scales with 1/lambda^4, as we said.

So f(theta) ~ sin^2(theta) / lambda^4.

So the form of f would be f ~ (sin^2(theta)) * lambda^(-4). So looking at the options, which ones have lambda^(-4) as the form? Option A has lambda^-4, but the fraction is 1/2. Option C has lambda^-4 and fraction 1/4. So in our case, the fraction is 1/4 and the function has lambda^-4, which is option C.

So the two answers are 1/4 and lambda^-4. So option C is the correct choice.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The power radiated per unit solid angle, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), depends on \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) relative to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the functional form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\).

For an oscillating dipole-like charge distribution, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\). The maximum power is radiated at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

The power radiated by an oscillating charge distribution scales as \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency. Since \(\omega = 2\pi f\) and \(f = c / \lambda\), it follows that \(\omega \propto c / \lambda\). Substituting this into the power dependence, the radiated power scales as \(1 / \lambda^4\). Therefore, the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), which represents the power per unit solid angle, also scales as \(1 / \lambda^4\).

Combining these results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the functional form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta) / \lambda^4\). This matches option C.
