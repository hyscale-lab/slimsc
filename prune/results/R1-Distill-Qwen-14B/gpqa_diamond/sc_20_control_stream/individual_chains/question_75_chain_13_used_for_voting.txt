Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see what the problem is about.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is inducibly overexpressed. They modified the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence they provided, I should analyze it to see where the problem might be. Let's break it down.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the hemagglutinin determinant is supposed to be added at the N-terminus. Oh wait, the construct includes the HA tag before the GADD45G coding sequence. So maybe the HA tag is causing issues.

But more importantly, the problem is about why the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let's look for any obvious issues in the coding sequence.

Looking at the sequence, after the ATG start codon, I see TAC C AT A CGA T. Wait, ATG is start, then TAC is Tyr, then C is Cys, A is Ala, T A is maybe Trp or something else? Not sure, but maybe that's the HA tag.

But wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, right? The HA tag is usually from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus, and the most common is YPYDVPDYA or similar. But the question says they introduced the sequence for a single hemagglutinin determinant. So perhaps the addition is correct.

But the issue is with the expression. So the options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Hmm, if the HA tag has a mutation, maybe the protein isn't expressed because it's not recognized by the machinery or maybe it's causing a stop. But the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct for start. Let me check the HA tag's DNA sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is often something like YPYDVPDYA. The DNA for that would be TAC TAC TAT GTA CTA GTA TTA. But in the given sequence, after ATG, the next nucleotides are TAC C AT A CGA T. Hmm, I'm not sure that's the HA tag. Wait, maybe the HA tag is added correctly, but perhaps there's a stop codon downstream that's causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, looking for in-frame stop codons. A stop codon is TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's scan the DNA sequence for these triplets.

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence is long, so I'll scan for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking:

...GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me go through and look for any TAG, TAA, or TGA.

Looking for TGA: I see TGT GAC CTT, TGA is there? Let's check.

Wait, let's look for TGA triplet.

Looking through:

- GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

I'll go through each triplet to see:

Looking for TGA:

- CTG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA C TGC C GGC GT C TAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GT C TTGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCT GTG TGC TGC GCT GCGG GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AGA ACG A CAT C GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA.

Ah, I see "TGA" here: the last part of the sequence has "TGA" as the 3' end, just before the stop. Wait, let me find the exact spot.

Looking at the end: ...GCGGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA in the middle:

Wait, within the sequence, let's see:

- ...TGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, towards the end, after CAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the very last part is ...CATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

So the last codon is GAG, then TGA. So the sequence ends with ...GAG TGA.

Wait, GAG is Glu, TGA is a stop codon. But the sequence is written in the 5' to 3' direction. Let me see: the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last two codons would be GAG (E) followed by TGA (stop). So the protein would terminate after those.

But wait, the original sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA, which is a stop. So what's the issue here?

Wait, noâ€”because the last part is TGA, so the stop codon is at the end. So the entire coding sequence should be correct, right? Because the stop codon is at the end. So that shouldn't cause a problem. Or maybe it's causing the ribosome to stop early?

Wait, unless the stop codon is in the middle of the construct. Looking through, is there any TGA, TAA, or TAG before the end?

Looking again: let me look for TGA.

In the middle, I see:

...CTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA, I don't see it except at the very end. So maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the reading frame. Let me check if the sequence has any in-frame stops. For example, the codons should be in triplets. Let's make sure that the sequence is in triplets.

The entire sequence is 1035 nucleotides long (counted as 1035), which is 345 codons. So it is a multiple of three, which is correct. So the coding sequence is correctly in frame.

Hmm. What other possibilities are there?

The options are:

A) The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly added, but that shouldn't prevent the entire protein from being expressed. Unless the mutation causes a stop codon, but I don't see a stop earlier.

B) The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the middle. But from what I can see, the only stop is at the end.

C) Lack of a linker causing proteolysis. So perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but without a linker, the protein is being degraded. The question says that the construct includes the HA tag, but maybe the ORF isn't properly arranged. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is added without a proper leader sequence or signal peptide, leading to the protein being targeted for degradation.

Wait, the construct includes a HA tag followed by GADD45G. If there's no linker or signal peptide, maybe the protein is not secreted or is recognized as foreign and degraded. But the issue is about expression, not function. If the protein is being expressed but then degraded, the Western blot wouldn't detect it because it's broken down. But the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening, so perhaps the construct isn't being translated.

Another possibility: the HA tag is causing a premature stop. Let me check the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA tag is usually about 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. The given sequence starts with ATG TAC C AT A CGA T. Let me translate that.

ATG is Met, TAC is Tyr, C is Cys, A is Ala, T is Thr, A CGA is Arg, T is Thr. So the first few amino acids would be Met-Tyr-Cys-Ala-Thr-Arg-Thr... Hmm, that doesn't look like the HA tag. The HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to TAC PTC TAT GTA CCT ATC TAT in DNA (but in reverse complement). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the HA tag is often encoded by the DNA sequence TAC TAC TAT GTA CTT GTA TTA, which is the coding strand for the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA). So if the given construct's initial sequence is ATG TAC C AT A CGA T..., that's Met Tyr Cys Ala Thr Arg, which doesn't match the HA tag. So maybe the HA tag was incorrectly added. That would be option A, a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But does this affect the entire construct's expression?

Wait, if the HA tag is not correctly added, then the protein is still expressed but without the HA tag. But the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag is wrong, would the protein not be expressed? Or would it just not bind to the HA antibody? Hmm, perhaps not. The problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing, so maybe the incorrect HA sequence causes a problem. For example, a premature stop codon in the HA tag.

Wait, looking at the initial part of the DNA sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG TAC C AT A CGA T... So the first few codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), C (Cys), AT (Ala), A CGA (Arg), T (Threonine), etc. So the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. If the HA tag was incorrectly inserted, perhaps a stop codon is introduced in the HA tag.

Wait, maybe the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, introducing a stop codon early. Let's see: the HA tag's DNA sequence is about 30 bp. If they inserted it in the wrong frame, the first codon might be a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was added in the wrong orientation. Let me think: the HA tag is added to the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, perhaps the first codon is a stop.

Wait, let's check the first few codons of the provided sequence. After ATG (Met), the next is TAC (Tyr), then C (Cys), A (Ala), T (Thr), A (Ala), CGA (Arg), T (Thr), etc. Wait, that's not the HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. So maybe the first few codons are not the HA tag, but the researcher intended to add it. So the HA tag is either missing or wrongly added.

If the HA tag was added incorrectly, perhaps it introduced a premature stop codon. Let's see: the first few codons are Met, Tyr, Cys, Ala, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. None of these are stop codons, so the translation would proceed beyond that.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence might have introduced a stop codon within it. For example, suppose the HA tag's DNA was inserted in reverse, causing a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle, which would cause the ribosome to stop early. But from the initial part of the sequence, I don't see any stop codons before the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence isn't correct, but the main issue is that the reporter or selection markers aren't working. Wait, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Another possibility is that the construct doesn't include an RBS (ribosome binding site), but in mammalian cells, the Kozak sequence is important. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, but perhaps the context around it isn't optimal. However, the question doesn't provide information about that, so maybe that's not the issue.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence might be necessary for proper folding or to prevent degradation. If the HA tag is directly fused to the GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the protein is misfolded and targeted for degradation. This would mean that the protein is being expressed but quickly broken down, so you don't see high levels of it. However, the question states that the overexpression isn't happening. If the protein is being expressed but rapidly degraded, Western blot might detect lower levels than expected, but perhaps the problem is that the construct isn't being made correctly.

Option B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. This would happen if there's a stop codon in the middle. But I don't see any in the provided sequence except the last TGA.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in scanning. Let me check again. Looking for TGA, TAA, TAG.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for TGA: I see the last few nucleotides are ...AGTGA. So the last codon is GAG (E) and then TGA (stop). So the stop is correctly at the end. No issues there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reading frame is messed up because the HA tag was inserted in a way that shifts the frame. For example, if the HA tag was inserted into the GADD45G gene without maintaining the correct reading frame, then the entire downstream sequence would be incorrect, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon.

But in the given sequence, it starts with ATG, which is correct. If the HA tag was inserted correctly, the reading frame should be maintained. So perhaps the HA tag was inserted in a way that the frame is shifted, causing a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted as a DNA fragment that disrupts the reading frame. Let me think about that.

Suppose the HA tag's DNA is 30 bp (10 codons). If it was inserted in the correct frame, then the reading frame remains the same. But if it was inserted in the wrong frame, as in, the number of nucleotides is not a multiple of three, it would cause a frameshift. Let's see: the HA tag is 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. So inserting 30 nucleotides would not cause a frameshift because 30 is a multiple of three. So the frame remains correct. So the HA tag, if correctly inserted, would add 10 amino acids correctly, then the rest of the GADD45G sequence would be correct.

But in our sequence, the initial part after ATG is TAC C AT A CGA T, which is the first few codons. So that's Met, Tyr, Cys, Ala, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. If the HA tag was supposed to be, say, the first 10 amino acids, those first 10 codons would encode the HA epitope, but in the given sequence, they don't. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift or incorrect sequence. But in that case, the first few codons would have a stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in the wrong orientation. If the HA tag was inserted as the reverse complement, then the start codon might be correct, but the HA sequence would not make sense, and perhaps a stop codon is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion was done in a way that the ATG is followed by the reverse complement of the HA tag's coding sequence, leading to a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was added as a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's coding sequence ends with a TAA, TAG, or TGA in frame, then the HA tag could cause a premature stop.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the HA tag's DNA is added in the same direction as the GADD45G gene. So the HA tag's DNA would be in frame, and the GADD45G would follow. But if the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction, then the sequence would be in the opposite direction, causing a frameshift or introducing a stop codon.

But in the given sequence, the initial part after ATG is TAC C AT A CGA T, which is in the same frame as GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift, but that would require the inserted DNA to have a length not divisible by three. Since HA is 30 nucleotides, that's 10 codons; so no frameshift. But if any part of the HA tag's DNA has a mutation, it could cause a missense in the HA tag but not necessarily affect the entire construct.

Wait, but the main issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the HA tag's incorrect sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early. For example, if the HA tag includes a stop codon.

Looking at the initial part of the sequence, I don't see any stop codons. So perhaps the HA tag is correct, but another problem exists.

Another possibility is that the plasmid lacks an RBS or Kozak sequence, which is important for initiating translation in mammalian cells. Without a proper RBS, the ribosome can't bind, so the protein isn't expressed. But the question doesn't mention anything about RBS, so maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, the options include option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, in the given sequence, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the stop codon is TGA. In mammalian cells, all three stop codons are recognized (UAA, UAG, UGA). So the tRNA for UGA exists as a release factor, not a tRNA. So the ribosome recognizes the stop codon without needing a tRNA. So option D is incorrect because the ribosome doesn't need a tRNA for stop codons.

So option D is not the reason.

So back to the options. The problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Possible reasons:

A) HA tag has a missense mutation: Perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly made, but why would that prevent expression? It should still be expressed, just not correctly tagged. But the issue is overexpression, so maybe it's expressed but not detected. But the question is about the inability to overexpress, so perhaps the HA tag causes a problem.

Wait, maybe the HA tag includes a stop codon. Let's think: the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then C (Cys), A (Ala), T (Thr), A (Ala), CGA (Arg), T (Thr). No stop codons there. So the HA tag (if it's 10 amino acids) would be followed by the rest of GADD45G.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction, leading to a termination codon in the same frame. For example, if the HA tag's DNA was inserted as the reverse complement, then the reading frame would be correct, but the amino acids would be the reverse complement, and perhaps a stop codon is present.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA is usually in the same direction as the gene. If it was inserted in reverse, the HA tag would be in the wrong orientation. Let's imagine that the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction. The DNA sequence for the HA tag would be complementary, so the mRNA would have the reverse sequence. Let me see: the HA tag's mRNA is something like AUC AUU AUA etc. If the DNA was inserted in the reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's insertion caused a frameshift. But as HA is 30 nucleotides, which is a multiple of three, there's no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA wasn't correctly inserted into the GADD45G gene, leading to a premature stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's DNA added a TAA in frame, then the ribosome would stop early.

Looking at the initial part of the DNA sequence, perhaps the HA tag's insertion introduced a stop codon.

Wait, let's see: the first few nucleotides after ATG are TAC C AT A CGA T.

So the first codon is TAC (Tyr), second is CAT (His?), wait noâ€”wait, wait, wait. No, the codons are read in triplets. Let me parse the sequence correctly.

The given sequence is:

5' ATG TAC C AT A CGA T ...

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TAC C AT A CGA T...

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me write it as triplets starting from the beginning.

The entire sequence is:

ATG TAC C AT A CGA TGG GTA CGT C TA C GAG TCA GCC AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCT GTG TGC TGC GCT GCGG GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AGA ACG A CAT C GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the first few triplets are:

ATG (1-3), TAC (4-6), C AT (7-9? No, triplet is 7-9: CAT?), wait no. Let me make sure.

Wait, the correct way is to split into triplets starting from the first nucleotide.

So the first 3 nucleotides: ATG (1-3) â†’ Met.

Next 3: TAC (4-6) â†’ Tyr.

Then CAT (7-9) â†’ His.

Wait, but the original sequence has "C AT A CGA T", which would be positions 4-6: TAC; 7-9: CAT; 10-12: ACG. So the first few codons are Met, Tyr, His, etc.

Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be added. So if the HA tag is Met, Tyr, His, etc., which doesn't match the HA epitope, perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA was not correctly added, leading to a frameshift or a wrong sequence.

Wait, but the length is correct. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong frame. But as it's 30 nucleotides, that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is incorrect, leading to a stop codon within the HA tag. For example, if the HA tag's DNA had a TAA in the middle, then the ribosome would terminate early.

Looking at the first few codons: Met, Tyr, His, etc. No stop there. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, but perhaps the construct lacks a signal peptide, causing the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or not secreted, but the question is about overexpression, not function.

Wait, back to the options. The correct answer is probably C) The lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, the protein may be misfolded or recognized as a target for degradation. So when the cells try to express it, the protein is quickly broken down, leading to no detectable overexpression.

Alternatively, option B says the ribosome terminated early. But in the sequence, the only stop is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the construct doesn't have a poly-A tail in the mRNA. But the question doesn't mention anything about the vector, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another angle: The HA tag is added to the N-terminus, but perhaps the reading frame shifts, introducing a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's DNA was inserted as a fragment that's not in frame, causing a frameshift. But as the HA tag is 30 nucleotides, which is a multiple of three, that shouldn't cause a frameshift.

Wait, unless the HA tag was inserted without proper ligation, causing some nucleotides to be lost or gained, leading to a frameshift. For example, if one nucleotide was lost, the reading frame would shift, leading to a completely different sequence and a premature stop codon.

But the question states that the construct was modified by introducing the HA sequence, so perhaps it was inserted correctly.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in a way that creates a stop codon in the same frame. For example, the HA tag's DNA might have a TAG or TGA codon in it. If that's the case, then the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all, depending on when the stop occurs.

Looking at the initial part of the sequence again:

The first few codons are Met, Tyr, His, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. No stop codons there. So if the HA tag's DNA didn't introduce a stop, the issue must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong orientation, making the HA tag's sequence unreadable, but the GADD45G sequence would still be in frame. But in that case, the HA tag would be in reverse complement, which might not cause a stop.

Hmm. Another possibility: the construct lacks a promoter. But the question says the construct is for overexpression, so it should have a strong promoter. But the problem is about the sequence provided, which seems to be the coding sequence, not the promoter.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction, leading to a stop codon in the original frame. For example, if the HA tag's DNA was added as the reverse complement, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could introduce a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag's coding DNA is usually in the same direction as the gene. If it's added in reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could introduce a stop codon.

Let me think: the HA tag's DNA is usually something like TAC TAC TAT GTA CTT GTA TTA. If it's inserted in the reverse direction, the DNA would be the complementary strand, so the mRNA would be AUGAUGA... which might include a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of DNA.

Suppose the correct HA tag DNA is:

5' TAC TAC TAT GTA CTT GTA TTA 3'

If it's inserted in the reverse direction, the inserted DNA would be:

5' ATT ACT AGT CAT TAG TAG TAC 3'

Wait, no, wait. The reverse complement of TAC would be GTA, so the reverse complement of the HA tag's DNA would be complementary and reversed.

Wait, perhaps if the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong orientation, the mRNA would be complementary, leading to a stop codon.

For example, the HA tag's DNA is supposed to be in the same direction as the GADD45G gene. If it's inserted in the reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

Let me see: the first codon after ATG would be the reverse of the HA tag's DNA. Suppose the reverse leads to a stop codon.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. However, the given sequence starts with ATG TAC C AT A CGA T, which doesn't include a stop codon early on.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the same direction as the GADD45G gene, but the reading frame shifted, leading to a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's insertion caused a frameshift, but as the length is correct, that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's insertion included a stop codon in the middle. For example, if the HA tag's DNA had a TGA, TAG, or TAA codon, then the ribosome would stop early.

Looking at the initial part: the first few codons are Met, Tyr, His, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. No stop codons. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA didn't introduce a stop, but maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid lacks a polylinker or other necessary elements, but the question focuses on the coding sequence.

Another angle: the problem could be that the HA tag is present, but the GADD45G coding sequence is absent. But the given sequence is long and appears to be the GADD45G coding sequence, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong place, disrupting the start codon. But the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me review the options again.

The options are:

A) HA has a missense â†’ possible, but why would that prevent expression?

B) Ribosome terminated early â†’ possible if a stop is present.

C) Lack of linker â†’ proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA â†’ incorrect, as stop codons don't require tRNA.

The given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop. So the stop is correctly at the end.

But perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted with an in-frame stop codon. Let's imagine that the HA tag's DNA includes a TGA. For example, the HA tag's DNA might have a TGA in the middle, leading to a premature stop.

But looking at the first few codons, I don't see a TGA. So unless the HA tag's insertion introduced a TGA earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's DNA is correctly added, but the issue is with the selection of the construct. For example, the construct doesn't have the correct multiple cloning site orientation, leading to no expression.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong orientation, leading to the wrong reading frame. But since the length is correct, the reading frame remains the same.

Wait, but if the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the reverse direction, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

Let me imagine the HA tag's DNA is supposed to be in the same direction. If it's inserted in reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

For example, the HA tag's correct mRNA is AUC AUC AUA..., but in reverse, it would be UA... which could include a UAA or UGA codon.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. However, the provided sequence starts with Met, Tyr, His, etc., which doesn't include a stop.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag's DNA introduced a stop codon in the same frame, leading the ribosome to terminate early.

But in the given sequence, I don't see any stop codons except at the end. So perhaps the HA tag is correct, but another problem exists.

Wait, another possibility: the construct doesn't include the RBS, so the ribosome can't bind, leading to no translation. But the question doesn't mention that, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag doesn't have a proper linker, leading to improper folding and proteolysis. So the protein is expressed but quickly degraded. If the cells are unable to process the fusion protein correctly, the protein would be broken down, leading to no detectable overexpression.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was added in a way that creates a cryptic splice site or other issues in mRNA processing, but that's more relevant in higher eukaryotes and not typically an issue with coding sequences.

Hmm. Since none of the other options seem to fit, I think the most likely answer is C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. So the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, causing the protein to be recognized as abnormal and degraded.

The question revolves around identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. The provided DNA sequence starts with the correct start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TGA), with no other stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) present in the middle. The sequence appears to be in frame, as it is a multiple of three nucleotides, and no frameshifts or premature stops are evident.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**  
   The HA tag is supposed to be added at the N-terminus, but the sequence provided does not match the expected HA tag sequence. However, a missense mutation in the HA tag would not necessarily prevent the entire protein from being expressed. The protein would still be translated, even if the HA tag is incorrect. This option does not explain the lack of overexpression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.**  
   A premature stop codon in the middle of the sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate early. However, the sequence does not contain any stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) except at the end. Therefore, this option is not supported by the data.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**  
   If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, the resulting fusion protein may be misfolded or recognized as abnormal by the cell's proteolytic machinery, leading to degradation. This would result in the protein being expressed but rapidly broken down, making it undetectable and preventing overexpression. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**  
   This option is incorrect because stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) are recognized by the ribosome itself, not by tRNAs. The ribosome terminates translation directly upon encountering a stop codon, so the absence of a tRNA for UAA is irrelevant.

### Conclusion:  
The most plausible explanation is that the lack of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G is causing the protein to be misfolded or targeted for proteolysis, leading to its degradation and preventing overexpression.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see what the problem is about.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is inducibly overexpressed. They modified the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence they provided, I should analyze it to see where the problem might be. Let's break it down.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the hemagglutinin determinant is supposed to be added at the N-terminus. Oh wait, the construct includes the HA tag before the GADD45G coding sequence. So maybe the HA tag is causing issues.

But more importantly, the problem is about why the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let's look for any obvious issues in the coding sequence.

Looking at the sequence, after the ATG start codon, I see TAC C AT A CGA T. Wait, ATG is start, then TAC is Tyr, then C is Cys, A is Ala, T A is maybe Trp or something else? Not sure, but maybe that's the HA tag.

But wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, right? The HA tag is usually from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus, and the most common is YPYDVPDYA or similar. But the question says they introduced the sequence for a single hemagglutinin determinant. So perhaps the addition is correct.

But the issue is with the expression. So the options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Hmm, if the HA tag has a mutation, maybe the protein isn't expressed because it's not recognized by the machinery or maybe it's causing a stop. But the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct for start. Let me check the HA tag's DNA sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is often something like YPYDVPDYA. The DNA for that would be TAC TAC TAT GTA CTA GTA TTA. But in the given sequence, after ATG, the next nucleotides are TAC C AT A CGA T. Hmm, I'm not sure that's the HA tag. Wait, maybe the HA tag is added correctly, but perhaps there's a stop codon downstream that's causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, looking for in-frame stop codons. A stop codon is TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's scan the DNA sequence for these triplets.

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence is long, so I'll scan for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking:

...GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me go through and look for any TAG, TAA, or TGA.

Looking for TGA: I see TGT GAC CTT, TGA is there? Let's check.

Wait, let's look for TGA triplet.

Looking through:

- GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

I'll go through each triplet to see:

Looking for TGA:

- CTG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA C TGC C GGC GT C TAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GT C TTGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCT GTG TGC TGC GCT GCGG GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AGA ACG A CAT C GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA.

Ah, I see "TGA" here: the last part of the sequence has "TGA" as the 3' end, just before the stop. Wait, let me find the exact spot.

Looking at the end: ...GCGGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA in the middle:

Wait, within the sequence, let's see:

- ...TGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, towards the end, after CAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the very last part is ...CATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

So the last codon is GAG, then TGA. So the sequence ends with ...GAG TGA.

Wait, GAG is Glu, TGA is a stop codon. But the sequence is written in the 5' to 3' direction. Let me see: the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last two codons would be GAG (E) followed by TGA (stop). So the protein would terminate after those.

But wait, the original sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA, which is a stop. So what's the issue here?

Wait, noâ€”because the last part is TGA, so the stop codon is at the end. So the entire coding sequence should be correct, right? Because the stop codon is at the end. So that shouldn't cause a problem. Or maybe it's causing the ribosome to stop early?

Wait, unless the stop codon is in the middle of the construct. Looking through, is there any TGA, TAA, or TAG before the end?

Looking again: let me look for TGA.

In the middle, I see:

...CTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA, I don't see it except at the very end. So maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the reading frame. Let me check if the sequence has any in-frame stops. For example, the codons should be in triplets. Let's make sure that the sequence is in triplets.

The entire sequence is 1035 nucleotides long (counted as 1035), which is 345 codons. So it is a multiple of three, which is correct. So the coding sequence is correctly in frame.

Hmm. What other possibilities are there?

The options are:

A) The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly added, but that shouldn't prevent the entire protein from being expressed. Unless the mutation causes a stop codon, but I don't see a stop earlier.

B) The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the middle. But from what I can see, the only stop is at the end.

C) Lack of a linker causing proteolysis. So perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but without a linker, the protein is being degraded. The question says that the construct includes the HA tag, but maybe the ORF isn't properly arranged. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is added without a proper leader sequence or signal peptide, leading to the protein being targeted for degradation.

Wait, the construct includes a HA tag followed by GADD45G. If there's no linker or signal peptide, maybe the protein is not secreted or is recognized as foreign and degraded. But the issue is about expression, not function. If the protein is being expressed but then degraded, the Western blot wouldn't detect it because it's broken down. But the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening, so perhaps the construct isn't being translated.

Another possibility: the HA tag is causing a premature stop. Let me check the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA tag is usually about 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. The given sequence starts with ATG TAC C AT A CGA T. Let me translate that.

ATG is Met, TAC is Tyr, C is Cys, A is Ala, T is Thr, A CGA is Arg, T is Thr. So the first few amino acids would be Met-Tyr-Cys-Ala-Thr-Arg-Thr... Hmm, that doesn't look like the HA tag. The HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to TAC PTC TAT GTA CCT ATC TAT in DNA (but in reverse complement). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the HA tag is often encoded by the DNA sequence TAC TAC TAT GTA CTT GTA TTA, which is the coding strand for the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA). So if the given construct's initial sequence is ATG TAC C AT A CGA T..., that's Met Tyr Cys Ala Thr Arg, which doesn't match the HA tag. So maybe the HA tag was incorrectly added. That would be option A, a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But does this affect the entire construct's expression?

Wait, if the HA tag is not correctly added, then the protein is still expressed but without the HA tag. But the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag is wrong, would the protein not be expressed? Or would it just not bind to the HA antibody? Hmm, perhaps not. The problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing, so maybe the incorrect HA sequence causes a problem. For example, a premature stop codon in the HA tag.

Wait, looking at the initial part of the DNA sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG TAC C AT A CGA T... So the first few codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), C (Cys), AT (Ala), A CGA (Arg), T (Threonine), etc. So the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. If the HA tag was incorrectly inserted, perhaps a stop codon is introduced in the HA tag.

Wait, maybe the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, introducing a stop codon early. Let's see: the HA tag's DNA sequence is about 30 bp. If they inserted it in the wrong frame, the first codon might be a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was added in the wrong orientation. Let me think: the HA tag is added to the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag was inserted in the wrong frame, perhaps the first codon is a stop.

Wait, let's check the first few codons of the provided sequence. After ATG (Met), the next is TAC (Tyr), then C (Cys), A (Ala), T (Thr), A (Ala), CGA (Arg), T (Thr), etc. Wait, that's not the HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. So maybe the first few codons are not the HA tag, but the researcher intended to add it. So the HA tag is either missing or wrongly added.

If the HA tag was added incorrectly, perhaps it introduced a premature stop codon. Let's see: the first few codons are Met, Tyr, Cys, Ala, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. None of these are stop codons, so the translation would proceed beyond that.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence might have introduced a stop codon within it. For example, suppose the HA tag's DNA was inserted in reverse, causing a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle, which would cause the ribosome to stop early. But from the initial part of the sequence, I don't see any stop codons before the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence isn't correct, but the main issue is that the reporter or selection markers aren't working. Wait, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Another possibility is that the construct doesn't include an RBS (ribosome binding site), but in mammalian cells, the Kozak sequence is important. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, but perhaps the context around it isn't optimal. However, the question doesn't provide information about that, so maybe that's not the issue.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence might be necessary for proper folding or to prevent degradation. If the HA tag is directly fused to the GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the protein is misfolded and targeted for degradation. This would mean that the protein is being expressed but quickly broken down, so you don't see high levels of it. However, the question states that the overexpression isn't happening. If the protein is being expressed but rapidly degraded, Western blot might detect lower levels than expected, but perhaps the problem is that the construct isn't being made correctly.

Option B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. This would happen if there's a stop codon in the middle. But I don't see any in the provided sequence except the last TGA.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in scanning. Let me check again. Looking for TGA, TAA, TAG.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for TGA: I see the last few nucleotides are ...AGTGA. So the last codon is GAG (E) and then TGA (stop). So the stop is correctly at the end. No issues there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reading frame is messed up because the HA tag was inserted in a way that shifts the frame. For example, if the HA tag was inserted into the GADD45G gene without maintaining the correct reading frame, then the entire downstream sequence would be incorrect, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon.

But in the given sequence, it starts with ATG, which is correct. If the HA tag was inserted correctly, the reading frame should be maintained. So perhaps the HA tag was inserted in a way that the frame is shifted, causing a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted as a DNA fragment that disrupts the reading frame. Let me think about that.

Suppose the HA tag's DNA is 30 bp (10 codons). If it was inserted in the correct frame, then the reading frame remains the same. But if it was inserted in the wrong frame, as in, the number of nucleotides is not a multiple of three, it would cause a frameshift. Let's see: the HA tag is 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. So inserting 30 nucleotides would not cause a frameshift because 30 is a multiple of three. So the frame remains correct. So the HA tag, if correctly inserted, would add 10 amino acids correctly, then the rest of the GADD45G sequence would be correct.

But in our sequence, the initial part after ATG is TAC C AT A CGA T, which is the first few codons. So that's Met, Tyr, Cys, Ala, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. If the HA tag was supposed to be, say, the first 10 amino acids, those first 10 codons would encode the HA epitope, but in the given sequence, they don't. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift or incorrect sequence. But in that case, the first few codons would have a stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in the wrong orientation. If the HA tag was inserted as the reverse complement, then the start codon might be correct, but the HA sequence would not make sense, and perhaps a stop codon is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion was done in a way that the ATG is followed by the reverse complement of the HA tag's coding sequence, leading to a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was added as a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's coding sequence ends with a TAA, TAG, or TGA in frame, then the HA tag could cause a premature stop.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the HA tag's DNA is added in the same direction as the GADD45G gene. So the HA tag's DNA would be in frame, and the GADD45G would follow. But if the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction, then the sequence would be in the opposite direction, causing a frameshift or introducing a stop codon.

But in the given sequence, the initial part after ATG is TAC C AT A CGA T, which is in the same frame as GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift, but that would require the inserted DNA to have a length not divisible by three. Since HA is 30 nucleotides, that's 10 codons; so no frameshift. But if any part of the HA tag's DNA has a mutation, it could cause a missense in the HA tag but not necessarily affect the entire construct.

Wait, but the main issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the HA tag's incorrect sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early. For example, if the HA tag includes a stop codon.

Looking at the initial part of the sequence, I don't see any stop codons. So perhaps the HA tag is correct, but another problem exists.

Another possibility is that the plasmid lacks an RBS or Kozak sequence, which is important for initiating translation in mammalian cells. Without a proper RBS, the ribosome can't bind, so the protein isn't expressed. But the question doesn't mention anything about RBS, so maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, the options include option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, in the given sequence, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the stop codon is TGA. In mammalian cells, all three stop codons are recognized (UAA, UAG, UGA). So the tRNA for UGA exists as a release factor, not a tRNA. So the ribosome recognizes the stop codon without needing a tRNA. So option D is incorrect because the ribosome doesn't need a tRNA for stop codons.

So option D is not the reason.

So back to the options. The problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Possible reasons:

A) HA tag has a missense mutation: Perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly made, but why would that prevent expression? It should still be expressed, just not correctly tagged. But the issue is overexpression, so maybe it's expressed but not detected. But the question is about the inability to overexpress, so perhaps the HA tag causes a problem.

Wait, maybe the HA tag includes a stop codon. Let's think: the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then C (Cys), A (Ala), T (Thr), A (Ala), CGA (Arg), T (Thr). No stop codons there. So the HA tag (if it's 10 amino acids) would be followed by the rest of GADD45G.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction, leading to a termination codon in the same frame. For example, if the HA tag's DNA was inserted as the reverse complement, then the reading frame would be correct, but the amino acids would be the reverse complement, and perhaps a stop codon is present.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA is usually in the same direction as the gene. If it was inserted in reverse, the HA tag would be in the wrong orientation. Let's imagine that the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction. The DNA sequence for the HA tag would be complementary, so the mRNA would have the reverse sequence. Let me see: the HA tag's mRNA is something like AUC AUU AUA etc. If the DNA was inserted in the reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's insertion caused a frameshift. But as HA is 30 nucleotides, which is a multiple of three, there's no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA wasn't correctly inserted into the GADD45G gene, leading to a premature stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's DNA added a TAA in frame, then the ribosome would stop early.

Looking at the initial part of the DNA sequence, perhaps the HA tag's insertion introduced a stop codon.

Wait, let's see: the first few nucleotides after ATG are TAC C AT A CGA T.

So the first codon is TAC (Tyr), second is CAT (His?), wait noâ€”wait, wait, wait. No, the codons are read in triplets. Let me parse the sequence correctly.

The given sequence is:

5' ATG TAC C AT A CGA T ...

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TAC C AT A CGA T...

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me write it as triplets starting from the beginning.

The entire sequence is:

ATG TAC C AT A CGA TGG GTA CGT C TA C GAG TCA GCC AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCT GTG TGC TGC GCT GCGG GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTC GCG AGA ACG A CAT C GAC ATA GTG CGC GGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the first few triplets are:

ATG (1-3), TAC (4-6), C AT (7-9? No, triplet is 7-9: CAT?), wait no. Let me make sure.

Wait, the correct way is to split into triplets starting from the first nucleotide.

So the first 3 nucleotides: ATG (1-3) â†’ Met.

Next 3: TAC (4-6) â†’ Tyr.

Then CAT (7-9) â†’ His.

Wait, but the original sequence has "C AT A CGA T", which would be positions 4-6: TAC; 7-9: CAT; 10-12: ACG. So the first few codons are Met, Tyr, His, etc.

Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be added. So if the HA tag is Met, Tyr, His, etc., which doesn't match the HA epitope, perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA was not correctly added, leading to a frameshift or a wrong sequence.

Wait, but the length is correct. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong frame. But as it's 30 nucleotides, that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is incorrect, leading to a stop codon within the HA tag. For example, if the HA tag's DNA had a TAA in the middle, then the ribosome would terminate early.

Looking at the first few codons: Met, Tyr, His, etc. No stop there. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, but perhaps the construct lacks a signal peptide, causing the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or not secreted, but the question is about overexpression, not function.

Wait, back to the options. The correct answer is probably C) The lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, the protein may be misfolded or recognized as a target for degradation. So when the cells try to express it, the protein is quickly broken down, leading to no detectable overexpression.

Alternatively, option B says the ribosome terminated early. But in the sequence, the only stop is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the construct doesn't have a poly-A tail in the mRNA. But the question doesn't mention anything about the vector, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another angle: The HA tag is added to the N-terminus, but perhaps the reading frame shifts, introducing a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag's DNA was inserted as a fragment that's not in frame, causing a frameshift. But as the HA tag is 30 nucleotides, which is a multiple of three, that shouldn't cause a frameshift.

Wait, unless the HA tag was inserted without proper ligation, causing some nucleotides to be lost or gained, leading to a frameshift. For example, if one nucleotide was lost, the reading frame would shift, leading to a completely different sequence and a premature stop codon.

But the question states that the construct was modified by introducing the HA sequence, so perhaps it was inserted correctly.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in a way that creates a stop codon in the same frame. For example, the HA tag's DNA might have a TAG or TGA codon in it. If that's the case, then the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all, depending on when the stop occurs.

Looking at the initial part of the sequence again:

The first few codons are Met, Tyr, His, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. No stop codons there. So if the HA tag's DNA didn't introduce a stop, the issue must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong orientation, making the HA tag's sequence unreadable, but the GADD45G sequence would still be in frame. But in that case, the HA tag would be in reverse complement, which might not cause a stop.

Hmm. Another possibility: the construct lacks a promoter. But the question says the construct is for overexpression, so it should have a strong promoter. But the problem is about the sequence provided, which seems to be the coding sequence, not the promoter.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA was added in the reverse direction, leading to a stop codon in the original frame. For example, if the HA tag's DNA was added as the reverse complement, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could introduce a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag's coding DNA is usually in the same direction as the gene. If it's added in reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could introduce a stop codon.

Let me think: the HA tag's DNA is usually something like TAC TAC TAT GTA CTT GTA TTA. If it's inserted in the reverse direction, the DNA would be the complementary strand, so the mRNA would be AUGAUGA... which might include a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of DNA.

Suppose the correct HA tag DNA is:

5' TAC TAC TAT GTA CTT GTA TTA 3'

If it's inserted in the reverse direction, the inserted DNA would be:

5' ATT ACT AGT CAT TAG TAG TAC 3'

Wait, no, wait. The reverse complement of TAC would be GTA, so the reverse complement of the HA tag's DNA would be complementary and reversed.

Wait, perhaps if the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong orientation, the mRNA would be complementary, leading to a stop codon.

For example, the HA tag's DNA is supposed to be in the same direction as the GADD45G gene. If it's inserted in the reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

Let me see: the first codon after ATG would be the reverse of the HA tag's DNA. Suppose the reverse leads to a stop codon.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. However, the given sequence starts with ATG TAC C AT A CGA T, which doesn't include a stop codon early on.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the same direction as the GADD45G gene, but the reading frame shifted, leading to a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's insertion caused a frameshift, but as the length is correct, that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's insertion included a stop codon in the middle. For example, if the HA tag's DNA had a TGA, TAG, or TAA codon, then the ribosome would stop early.

Looking at the initial part: the first few codons are Met, Tyr, His, Thr, Arg, Thr, etc. No stop codons. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA didn't introduce a stop, but maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid lacks a polylinker or other necessary elements, but the question focuses on the coding sequence.

Another angle: the problem could be that the HA tag is present, but the GADD45G coding sequence is absent. But the given sequence is long and appears to be the GADD45G coding sequence, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong place, disrupting the start codon. But the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me review the options again.

The options are:

A) HA has a missense â†’ possible, but why would that prevent expression?

B) Ribosome terminated early â†’ possible if a stop is present.

C) Lack of linker â†’ proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA â†’ incorrect, as stop codons don't require tRNA.

The given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop. So the stop is correctly at the end.

But perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted with an in-frame stop codon. Let's imagine that the HA tag's DNA includes a TGA. For example, the HA tag's DNA might have a TGA in the middle, leading to a premature stop.

But looking at the first few codons, I don't see a TGA. So unless the HA tag's insertion introduced a TGA earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's DNA is correctly added, but the issue is with the selection of the construct. For example, the construct doesn't have the correct multiple cloning site orientation, leading to no expression.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the wrong orientation, leading to the wrong reading frame. But since the length is correct, the reading frame remains the same.

Wait, but if the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the reverse direction, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

Let me imagine the HA tag's DNA is supposed to be in the same direction. If it's inserted in reverse, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which could include a stop codon.

For example, the HA tag's correct mRNA is AUC AUC AUA..., but in reverse, it would be UA... which could include a UAA or UGA codon.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. However, the provided sequence starts with Met, Tyr, His, etc., which doesn't include a stop.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag's DNA introduced a stop codon in the same frame, leading the ribosome to terminate early.

But in the given sequence, I don't see any stop codons except at the end. So perhaps the HA tag is correct, but another problem exists.

Wait, another possibility: the construct doesn't include the RBS, so the ribosome can't bind, leading to no translation. But the question doesn't mention that, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag doesn't have a proper linker, leading to improper folding and proteolysis. So the protein is expressed but quickly degraded. If the cells are unable to process the fusion protein correctly, the protein would be broken down, leading to no detectable overexpression.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was added in a way that creates a cryptic splice site or other issues in mRNA processing, but that's more relevant in higher eukaryotes and not typically an issue with coding sequences.

Hmm. Since none of the other options seem to fit, I think the most likely answer is C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. So the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, causing the protein to be recognized as abnormal and degraded.


The question revolves around identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. The provided DNA sequence starts with the correct start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TGA), with no other stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) present in the middle. The sequence appears to be in frame, as it is a multiple of three nucleotides, and no frameshifts or premature stops are evident.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**  
   The HA tag is supposed to be added at the N-terminus, but the sequence provided does not match the expected HA tag sequence. However, a missense mutation in the HA tag would not necessarily prevent the entire protein from being expressed. The protein would still be translated, even if the HA tag is incorrect. This option does not explain the lack of overexpression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.**  
   A premature stop codon in the middle of the sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate early. However, the sequence does not contain any stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) except at the end. Therefore, this option is not supported by the data.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**  
   If the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, the resulting fusion protein may be misfolded or recognized as abnormal by the cell's proteolytic machinery, leading to degradation. This would result in the protein being expressed but rapidly broken down, making it undetectable and preventing overexpression. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**  
   This option is incorrect because stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) are recognized by the ribosome itself, not by tRNAs. The ribosome terminates translation directly upon encountering a stop codon, so the absence of a tRNA for UAA is irrelevant.

### Conclusion:  
The most plausible explanation is that the lack of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G is causing the protein to be misfolded or targeted for proteolysis, leading to its degradation and preventing overexpression.
