Okay, so I've got this problem about black hole entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the event horizon. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), or something like that. Wait, maybe it's S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length. Oh right, the Planck units. 

So the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon, θ, and the distance d. I need to find the entropy. How do I connect the angular size to the radius of the black hole?

Angular size is given by θ ≈ diameter / distance. Oh wait, wait, more accurately, θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / (2d), because the tangent of θ is opposite over adjacent, which would be radius over distance for small angles. So θ ≈ (2r) / (2d) ) → θ ≈ r/d. But wait, θ is given in degrees. I think I'll have to convert that to radians first.

Wait, let me think. The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) = (2R) / (d), where R is the radius of the event horizon. Because the diameter is 2R, so the angular size is diameter over distance. So θ_rad = 2R / d. 

Wait, but the given θ is 1e-17 degrees. I should convert that to radians. Because 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ approx 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 rad. Then, using θ_rad = 2R / d. So R = (θ_rad * d) / 2. 

Wait, but wait, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert that to meters because all the constants are in SI units. Hmm, parsecs to meters. I remember 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2. Let me compute that. 

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) e ( -19 +26 ) → 1.745 *3.086 is roughly 5.37. So 5.37e7. Then divide by 2: R ≈ 2.685e7 meters. Wait, 2.685e7 meters is 2.685e4 kilometers, which is 26,850 km. Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c². So R = R_s, right? Because the event horizon is at R_s for a non-rotating black hole. 

So R = 2GM/c². But I don't have M; I have R, so maybe I can find M from R. Wait, but I don't think I need M directly, because the entropy formula is in terms of R. 

Wait, the entropy S is given by S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. A is 4π R². So S = (k_B c^3 * 4π R²) / (4 ħ G) → simplifies to (k_B c^3 π R² ) / ( ħ G ). 

Alternatively, I remember that S = (k_B A) / (4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length. Because l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p² = ħ G / c^3. So substituting, S = (k_B * 4 π R²) / (4 l_p²) ) → S = (k_B π R²) / l_p².

So, which formula is easier? Let's see. I can compute R from θ, then compute A, then compute S.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute R. 

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. 

θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180) = (1e-17) * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. 

Then, R = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

So R = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7 (since 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7) ) /2.

1.745 * 3.086 ≈ let's compute: 1.7 *3 =5.1, 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, and 0.086 *1.745 ≈ 0.150. So approximately 5.235 + 0.15 = 5.385. So 5.385e7 / 2 = 2.6925e7 meters.

So R ≈ 2.6925e7 meters.

Wait, but wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². So R = R_s, so the mass would be M = (R c² )/(2 G). But perhaps I don't need M for the entropy.

Now, the area A is 4π R². 

So A = 4 * π * (2.6925e7 m)^2.

Let me compute R²: (2.6925e7)^2 = (approx 7.25e14 m²).

Wait, 2.6925e7 squared. Let me compute 2.6925 squared: 2.6925 * 2.6925. 2^2=4, 0.6925^2 ≈ 0.479. 2*2.6925 *0.6925 ≈ 3.712. So adding gives about 4 + 3.712 +0.479 ≈ 8.191. Wait, wait, no, that's (a + b)^2 where a=2, b=0.6925. So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 4 + 2*(2)(0.6925) + (0.6925)^2 → 4 + 2.77 + 0.479 → ~7.249. So (2.6925)^2 ≈7.249. So (2.6925e7)^2 = (2.6925)^2 * 1e14 = 7.249e14 m².

So A = 4 * π * 7.249e14 = 4 * 3.1416 *7.249e14 ≈ 12.566 *7.249e14 ≈ let's compute 12 *7.249e14 = 8.6988e15, and 0.566 *7.249e14 ≈ 4.104e14. So total A ≈ (8.6988e15 +4.104e14) → 8.6988e15 + 0.4104e15 = ~9.109e15 m².

Wait, perhaps more accurately: 4 * π *7.249e14 → 4 * 3.1416 is ~12.566, so 12.566 *7.249e14 = ?

Let me compute 12.566 *7.249 = ?

10 *7.249=72.49

2.566 *7.249 = let's see: 2 *7.249=14.498, 0.566 *7.249 ≈4.105. So 14.498 +4.105 =18.603. So total 72.49 +18.603=91.093.

So 12.566 *7.249e14 =91.093e14 =9.1093e15 m². So A ≈9.1093e15 m².

Now, the entropy S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Wait, no, earlier I thought S = (k_B A) / (4 l_p² ), since l_p² = ħ G c^{-3}.

So l_p is Planck length, l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ). So l_p squared is ħ G / c^3.

So, re-expressing S, which is (k_B A) / (4 l_p² ).

So S = k_B * A / (4 l_p² )

So let me compute l_p². I'll need Planck constants, G, c, etc.

Values:

ħ (hbar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is 6.67430e-11 m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So l_p squared is (ħ G) / c^3.

Compute numerator: ħ * G = (1.05457e-34 J s) * (6.6743e-11 m^3/kg/s²) )

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so J s is kg m²/s.

So (1.05457e-34 kg m²/s) * (6.6743e-11 m^3/(kg s²)) ) → 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = approx 7.03e-45 kg m^5/(s^3 kg) → no, perhaps better to compute the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value first.

1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743) e (-34-11) → 1.05457 *6.6743 ≈ 7.03. So 7.03e-45.

Then denominator: c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m^3/s^3.

So l_p squared = (7.03e-45) / (2.7e25) ) → 7.03 /2.7 ≈2.6, so 2.6e-70 m².

Wait, 7.03e-45 / 2.7e25 = (7.03 / 2.7) *1e-45-25 = 2.6 *1e-70 → 2.6e-70 m².

Wait, so l_p² is about 2.6e-70 m². Hmm.

Now, compute S = (k_B * A ) / (4 l_p² )

k_B is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

A is 9.1093e15 m².

So S = (1.380649e-23 J/K *9.1093e15 m² ) / (4 * 2.6e-70 m² )

Wait, but l_p² is 2.6e-70 m², so 4 * l_p² is 1.04e-69 m².

Wait, no, 4 *2.6e-70 = 1.04e-69 m².

Wait wait, S is (k_B A) / (4 l_p^2 )

So:

k_B * A = 1.38e-23 *9.1093e15 = 1.38 *9.1093e ( -23 +15 ) → 1.38 *9.1093 ≈12.59 → 12.59e-8.

So 12.59e-8 J m²/K.

Hmm, but J m^2 is kg m^5/s^2, but perhaps I don't need to worry about units now.

Denominator:4*l_p^2= 4 * (2.6e-70 )=1.04e-69 m².

So S = (12.59e-8 ) / (1.04e-69 ) = 12.59 /1.04 * 1e( -8 +69 ) → approx 12.1 /1.04 is about 11.638, so 11.638e61 → 1.1638e62 J/K.

Wait, so approximately 1e62 J/K. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, option B is 1e59, C is 1e66, D 1e65.

So the answer is A) 1e62 J/K?

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of l_p squared.

Wait, Planck length squared: l_p² = ( ħ G ) / c^3.

So ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

G is 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²).

c is 3e8 m/s.

So (ħ G) = (1.05457e-34) * (6.674e-11) = let's compute 1.05457 *6.674 ≈ 7.03, so 7.03e-45.

c^3 is (3e8)^3=27e24=2.7e25.

So (ħ G)/c^3 =7.03e-45 / 2.7e25 = approx 2.6e-70 m². Correct.

So l_p^2 is 2.6e-70 m².

A is 9.109e15 m².

So, S=(k_B * A )/(4 l_p^2 )

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So (1.38e-23 *9.109e15 )= 1.38 *9.109e ( -23 +15 ) → 1.38 *9.109=12.59, so 12.59e-8 =1.259e-7 J m²/K.

Wait, but J m² is kg m^4/s², but perhaps that's not crucial.

Denominator:4*l_p²=4*2.6e-70=1.04e-69 m².

So S= (1.259e-7 J m^2/K ) / (1.04e-69 m² ) = (1.259e-7 ) / (1.04e-69 ) → because m² cancels.

1.259e-7 /1.04e-69 = (1.259/1.04 )e( -7 +69 ) ≈ 1.21e62 → 1.21e62 J/K.

So order of magnitude is 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in R calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the angular size θ was given as 1e-17 degrees. I converted that to radians correctly, I think.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then R = (θ_rad * d ) / 2.

But wait, the formula for θ in radians is approximately (2R)/d. Because the angular diameter is 2R/d. So R = (θ_rad * d ) / 2.

Which is what I did.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used R = (θ_rad * d ), without the division by 2. Oh wait no, because θ_rad is the angle, which is 2R/d. So R = (θ_rad * d ) /2. So that part is correct.

Another possible mistake: the calculation of A.

A =4 pi R^2 = 4 pi (2.6925e7 m)^2.

So 2.6925e7 squared is (2.6925)^2 *1e14 m² =7.249 *1e14 =7.249e14 m².

A=4 *3.1416 *7.249e14=12.566 *7.249e14=9.109e15 m².

That seems correct.

Another possible mistake: in the entropy formula. Did I substitute correctly?

Yes, S = (k_B * A) / (4 l_p^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I should re-calculate the numbers again.

So:

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

A=9.11e15 m².

l_p^2=2.6e-70 m².

So numerator: 1.38e-23 *9.11e15 = (1.38 *9.11) *1e(-23+15) → 12.58 *1e-8 = 1.258e-7.

Denominator:4 *2.6e-70 =1.04e-69.

So S=(1.258e-7) / (1.04e-69 ) = (1.258 /1.04 ) *1e( -7 +69 ) → 1.21e62.

So 1.21e62 J/K → which is 1e62 order of magnitude.

So the correct answer is A) 1e62 J/K.

To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the formula for black hole entropy:

\[
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 l_p^2},
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(l_p\) is the Planck length. The area \(A\) is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2,
\]

where \(R\) is the radius of the event horizon. The radius \(R\) can be derived from the angular size of the event horizon, \(\theta\), and the distance \(d\) to the black hole using the formula:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{2R}{d} \quad \text{(for small angles in radians)}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert angular size to radians
The angular size is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\). Converting to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the radius \(R\)
Using \(\theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{2R}{d}\), rearrange for \(R\):

\[
R = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2}.
\]

The distance \(d\) is given as \(10^{10}\) parsecs. Converting parsecs to meters (\(1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}\)):

\[
d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

Substituting values:

\[
R = \frac{(1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26})}{2} \approx 2.6925 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area \(A\)
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

Substituting \(R = 2.6925 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}\):

\[
R^2 = (2.6925 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 7.249 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi \cdot 7.249 \times 10^{14} \approx 9.109 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
The entropy formula is:

\[
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 l_p^2}.
\]

The Planck length squared is:

\[
l_p^2 = \frac{\hbar G}{c^3},
\]

where \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\), \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\), and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting:

\[
l_p^2 = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11})}{(3 \times 10^8)^3} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-70} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Substituting \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), \(A = 9.109 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2\), and \(l_p^2 = 2.6 \times 10^{-70} \, \text{m}^2\):

\[
S = \frac{(1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (9.109 \times 10^{15})}{4 \cdot (2.6 \times 10^{-70})}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (9.109 \times 10^{15}) \approx 1.259 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \cdot (2.6 \times 10^{-70}) = 1.04 \times 10^{-69}.
\]

Finally, divide:

\[
S = \frac{1.259 \times 10^{-8}}{1.04 \times 10^{-69}} \approx 1.21 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The order of magnitude of the entropy is \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\), corresponding to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this problem about black hole entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the event horizon. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), or something like that. Wait, maybe it's S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length. Oh right, the Planck units. 

So the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon, θ, and the distance d. I need to find the entropy. How do I connect the angular size to the radius of the black hole?

Angular size is given by θ ≈ diameter / distance. Oh wait, wait, more accurately, θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / (2d), because the tangent of θ is opposite over adjacent, which would be radius over distance for small angles. So θ ≈ (2r) / (2d) ) → θ ≈ r/d. But wait, θ is given in degrees. I think I'll have to convert that to radians first.

Wait, let me think. The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) = (2R) / (d), where R is the radius of the event horizon. Because the diameter is 2R, so the angular size is diameter over distance. So θ_rad = 2R / d. 

Wait, but the given θ is 1e-17 degrees. I should convert that to radians. Because 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ approx 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 rad. Then, using θ_rad = 2R / d. So R = (θ_rad * d) / 2. 

Wait, but wait, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert that to meters because all the constants are in SI units. Hmm, parsecs to meters. I remember 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2. Let me compute that. 

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) e ( -19 +26 ) → 1.745 *3.086 is roughly 5.37. So 5.37e7. Then divide by 2: R ≈ 2.685e7 meters. Wait, 2.685e7 meters is 2.685e4 kilometers, which is 26,850 km. Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c². So R = R_s, right? Because the event horizon is at R_s for a non-rotating black hole. 

So R = 2GM/c². But I don't have M; I have R, so maybe I can find M from R. Wait, but I don't think I need M directly, because the entropy formula is in terms of R. 

Wait, the entropy S is given by S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. A is 4π R². So S = (k_B c^3 * 4π R²) / (4 ħ G) → simplifies to (k_B c^3 π R² ) / ( ħ G ). 

Alternatively, I remember that S = (k_B A) / (4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length. Because l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ), so l_p² = ħ G / c^3. So substituting, S = (k_B * 4 π R²) / (4 l_p²) ) → S = (k_B π R²) / l_p².

So, which formula is easier? Let's see. I can compute R from θ, then compute A, then compute S.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute R. 

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. 

θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180) = (1e-17) * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. 

Then, R = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

So R = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7 (since 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7) ) /2.

1.745 * 3.086 ≈ let's compute: 1.7 *3 =5.1, 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, and 0.086 *1.745 ≈ 0.150. So approximately 5.235 + 0.15 = 5.385. So 5.385e7 / 2 = 2.6925e7 meters.

So R ≈ 2.6925e7 meters.

Wait, but wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². So R = R_s, so the mass would be M = (R c² )/(2 G). But perhaps I don't need M for the entropy.

Now, the area A is 4π R². 

So A = 4 * π * (2.6925e7 m)^2.

Let me compute R²: (2.6925e7)^2 = (approx 7.25e14 m²).

Wait, 2.6925e7 squared. Let me compute 2.6925 squared: 2.6925 * 2.6925. 2^2=4, 0.6925^2 ≈ 0.479. 2*2.6925 *0.6925 ≈ 3.712. So adding gives about 4 + 3.712 +0.479 ≈ 8.191. Wait, wait, no, that's (a + b)^2 where a=2, b=0.6925. So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 4 + 2*(2)(0.6925) + (0.6925)^2 → 4 + 2.77 + 0.479 → ~7.249. So (2.6925)^2 ≈7.249. So (2.6925e7)^2 = (2.6925)^2 * 1e14 = 7.249e14 m².

So A = 4 * π * 7.249e14 = 4 * 3.1416 *7.249e14 ≈ 12.566 *7.249e14 ≈ let's compute 12 *7.249e14 = 8.6988e15, and 0.566 *7.249e14 ≈ 4.104e14. So total A ≈ (8.6988e15 +4.104e14) → 8.6988e15 + 0.4104e15 = ~9.109e15 m².

Wait, perhaps more accurately: 4 * π *7.249e14 → 4 * 3.1416 is ~12.566, so 12.566 *7.249e14 = ?

Let me compute 12.566 *7.249 = ?

10 *7.249=72.49

2.566 *7.249 = let's see: 2 *7.249=14.498, 0.566 *7.249 ≈4.105. So 14.498 +4.105 =18.603. So total 72.49 +18.603=91.093.

So 12.566 *7.249e14 =91.093e14 =9.1093e15 m². So A ≈9.1093e15 m².

Now, the entropy S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Wait, no, earlier I thought S = (k_B A) / (4 l_p² ), since l_p² = ħ G c^{-3}.

So l_p is Planck length, l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ). So l_p squared is ħ G / c^3.

So, re-expressing S, which is (k_B A) / (4 l_p² ).

So S = k_B * A / (4 l_p² )

So let me compute l_p². I'll need Planck constants, G, c, etc.

Values:

ħ (hbar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is 6.67430e-11 m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So l_p squared is (ħ G) / c^3.

Compute numerator: ħ * G = (1.05457e-34 J s) * (6.6743e-11 m^3/kg/s²) )

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so J s is kg m²/s.

So (1.05457e-34 kg m²/s) * (6.6743e-11 m^3/(kg s²)) ) → 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = approx 7.03e-45 kg m^5/(s^3 kg) → no, perhaps better to compute the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value first.

1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743) e (-34-11) → 1.05457 *6.6743 ≈ 7.03. So 7.03e-45.

Then denominator: c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m^3/s^3.

So l_p squared = (7.03e-45) / (2.7e25) ) → 7.03 /2.7 ≈2.6, so 2.6e-70 m².

Wait, 7.03e-45 / 2.7e25 = (7.03 / 2.7) *1e-45-25 = 2.6 *1e-70 → 2.6e-70 m².

Wait, so l_p² is about 2.6e-70 m². Hmm.

Now, compute S = (k_B * A ) / (4 l_p² )

k_B is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

A is 9.1093e15 m².

So S = (1.380649e-23 J/K *9.1093e15 m² ) / (4 * 2.6e-70 m² )

Wait, but l_p² is 2.6e-70 m², so 4 * l_p² is 1.04e-69 m².

Wait, no, 4 *2.6e-70 = 1.04e-69 m².

Wait wait, S is (k_B A) / (4 l_p^2 )

So:

k_B * A = 1.38e-23 *9.1093e15 = 1.38 *9.1093e ( -23 +15 ) → 1.38 *9.1093 ≈12.59 → 12.59e-8.

So 12.59e-8 J m²/K.

Hmm, but J m^2 is kg m^5/s^2, but perhaps I don't need to worry about units now.

Denominator:4*l_p^2= 4 * (2.6e-70 )=1.04e-69 m².

So S = (12.59e-8 ) / (1.04e-69 ) = 12.59 /1.04 * 1e( -8 +69 ) → approx 12.1 /1.04 is about 11.638, so 11.638e61 → 1.1638e62 J/K.

Wait, so approximately 1e62 J/K. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, option B is 1e59, C is 1e66, D 1e65.

So the answer is A) 1e62 J/K?

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of l_p squared.

Wait, Planck length squared: l_p² = ( ħ G ) / c^3.

So ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

G is 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²).

c is 3e8 m/s.

So (ħ G) = (1.05457e-34) * (6.674e-11) = let's compute 1.05457 *6.674 ≈ 7.03, so 7.03e-45.

c^3 is (3e8)^3=27e24=2.7e25.

So (ħ G)/c^3 =7.03e-45 / 2.7e25 = approx 2.6e-70 m². Correct.

So l_p^2 is 2.6e-70 m².

A is 9.109e15 m².

So, S=(k_B * A )/(4 l_p^2 )

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So (1.38e-23 *9.109e15 )= 1.38 *9.109e ( -23 +15 ) → 1.38 *9.109=12.59, so 12.59e-8 =1.259e-7 J m²/K.

Wait, but J m² is kg m^4/s², but perhaps that's not crucial.

Denominator:4*l_p²=4*2.6e-70=1.04e-69 m².

So S= (1.259e-7 J m^2/K ) / (1.04e-69 m² ) = (1.259e-7 ) / (1.04e-69 ) → because m² cancels.

1.259e-7 /1.04e-69 = (1.259/1.04 )e( -7 +69 ) ≈ 1.21e62 → 1.21e62 J/K.

So order of magnitude is 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in R calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the angular size θ was given as 1e-17 degrees. I converted that to radians correctly, I think.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then R = (θ_rad * d ) / 2.

But wait, the formula for θ in radians is approximately (2R)/d. Because the angular diameter is 2R/d. So R = (θ_rad * d ) / 2.

Which is what I did.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used R = (θ_rad * d ), without the division by 2. Oh wait no, because θ_rad is the angle, which is 2R/d. So R = (θ_rad * d ) /2. So that part is correct.

Another possible mistake: the calculation of A.

A =4 pi R^2 = 4 pi (2.6925e7 m)^2.

So 2.6925e7 squared is (2.6925)^2 *1e14 m² =7.249 *1e14 =7.249e14 m².

A=4 *3.1416 *7.249e14=12.566 *7.249e14=9.109e15 m².

That seems correct.

Another possible mistake: in the entropy formula. Did I substitute correctly?

Yes, S = (k_B * A) / (4 l_p^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I should re-calculate the numbers again.

So:

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

A=9.11e15 m².

l_p^2=2.6e-70 m².

So numerator: 1.38e-23 *9.11e15 = (1.38 *9.11) *1e(-23+15) → 12.58 *1e-8 = 1.258e-7.

Denominator:4 *2.6e-70 =1.04e-69.

So S=(1.258e-7) / (1.04e-69 ) = (1.258 /1.04 ) *1e( -7 +69 ) → 1.21e62.

So 1.21e62 J/K → which is 1e62 order of magnitude.

So the correct answer is A) 1e62 J/K.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the formula for black hole entropy:

\[
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 l_p^2},
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(l_p\) is the Planck length. The area \(A\) is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2,
\]

where \(R\) is the radius of the event horizon. The radius \(R\) can be derived from the angular size of the event horizon, \(\theta\), and the distance \(d\) to the black hole using the formula:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{2R}{d} \quad \text{(for small angles in radians)}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert angular size to radians
The angular size is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\). Converting to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the radius \(R\)
Using \(\theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{2R}{d}\), rearrange for \(R\):

\[
R = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2}.
\]

The distance \(d\) is given as \(10^{10}\) parsecs. Converting parsecs to meters (\(1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}\)):

\[
d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

Substituting values:

\[
R = \frac{(1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26})}{2} \approx 2.6925 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area \(A\)
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

Substituting \(R = 2.6925 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}\):

\[
R^2 = (2.6925 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 7.249 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi \cdot 7.249 \times 10^{14} \approx 9.109 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
The entropy formula is:

\[
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 l_p^2}.
\]

The Planck length squared is:

\[
l_p^2 = \frac{\hbar G}{c^3},
\]

where \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\), \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\), and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting:

\[
l_p^2 = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11})}{(3 \times 10^8)^3} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-70} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Substituting \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), \(A = 9.109 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2\), and \(l_p^2 = 2.6 \times 10^{-70} \, \text{m}^2\):

\[
S = \frac{(1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (9.109 \times 10^{15})}{4 \cdot (2.6 \times 10^{-70})}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (9.109 \times 10^{15}) \approx 1.259 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \cdot (2.6 \times 10^{-70}) = 1.04 \times 10^{-69}.
\]

Finally, divide:

\[
S = \frac{1.259 \times 10^{-8}}{1.04 \times 10^{-69}} \approx 1.21 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The order of magnitude of the entropy is \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\), corresponding to option **A**.
