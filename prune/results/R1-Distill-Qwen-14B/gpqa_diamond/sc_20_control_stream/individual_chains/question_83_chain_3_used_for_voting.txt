Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, it's a classic acid-base titration. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. But let's break it down.

First, let's figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is halved because volume doubles. Wait, let me calculate that.

M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, the NaOH will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O. So at any point during the titration, the moles of NaOH added will neutralize some of the acetic acid.

The problem asks for two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. Let's handle them one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate.

But wait, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So, to find the pH at equivalence, we need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate solution. But first, let's find the concentration.

Wait, how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence? Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 cm³) = 0.001 moles. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters? No, wait 1 cm³ is 1 mL, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L? Wait, no, 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L? No, 20 cm³ is 0.02 * 10^-3 = 0.00002 L? Wait, no, wait, volume in liters is cm³ divided by 1000. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L? Wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 * (10^-3 m³) → 0.00002 m³? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1 L = 1000 mL, and 1 cm³ = 1 mL. So 20 cm³ is 20 mL, which is 0.02 L. Oh, okay, I was getting confused.

So moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

But wait, the NaOH is added until 25% titration. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized. So let's proceed.

At equivalence point, the solution is sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate will be same as the moles of acetic acid originally, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume of the solution at equivalence point will be the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added.

Wait, but how much NaOH is added at equivalence? Let me calculate. Moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of sodium acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) will hydrolyze in water as follows: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, so we can use the approximation for weak bases.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02. Setting that equal to 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. This is [OH⁻], so pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ let's compute this.

Log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → approx 0.5175 -6 = -5.4825. So pOH is 5.4825. So pH = 14 -5.4825=8.5175, approximately 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52. Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → equivalence is 8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. So Option A includes 8.52. So equivalence point is 8.52, but wait, wait, no: looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value, which would be the equivalence point. But let me also check the other part of the problem, the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added is 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate.

So, after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate produced are 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. But wait, how much NaOH is added at 25% titration? Since the moles needed for equivalence are 0.001, 0.00025 moles is 25% of that. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³.

So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Now, the concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's find pKa. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so pKa is about (5 - 0.267) =4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256. Approximately 4.26.

Looking back, the options, option A says first value is 4.26 and second is 8.52. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, when we diluted the acetic acid, we had 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles is 0.05 * (20e-3 L) = 0.001 mol. Then when we add 40 mL of solution (20 mL water), the concentration becomes 0.001 / (40e-3) = 0.025 M as I thought.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. Moles of HA left = 0.00075, A- is 0.00025. Volume is 40 + 2.5=42.5 mL.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425 L= 0.017647 M. [A-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647)= pKa + log(0.3333)

pKa is about 4.733 (since 1.85e-5 is Ka). Log(0.3333)= -0.477. So pH is 4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

At equivalence, as calculated earlier, the pH is approximately 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A has those values.

Wait, but wait, the options: Option A is 4.26;8.52. So that's the first and second values.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether I accounted for all the dilutions correctly. Let me recheck the equivalence point.

At equivalence, sodium acetate is 0.001 moles, and the total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH added) =50 mL=0.05 L.

So concentration is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct. Kb is 5.405e-10. So the OH- concentration is sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10). Which is sqrt(1.081e-11)=3.288e-6. So pOH is 5.48, pH is 8.52. So that's correct.

So option A seems correct. But looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dilution step. Let me recheck.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Add 20 cm³ water: total 40 cm³.

So concentration after dilution is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) /40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added: 0.00025. So the volume of NaOH is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³. Correct.

So the total volume is 40+2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425≈0.017647 M, [A-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M. Ratio is 0.333, so pH is 4.73 + log(0.333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253≈4.26.

So the calculations seem correct. So option A is the right answer. But looking back at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches our findings.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. Here's the breakdown:

### Initial Setup
- **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**  
  \( \text{Moles} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).  
- After dilution with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes:  
  \( \text{Concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of NaOH added:**  
  \( 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:**  
  \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed:**  
  \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Total volume of solution:**  
  \( 40 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
- **Concentrations:**  
  \( [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M} \),  
  \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M} \).  

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right)
\]  
The \( \text{pKa} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733
\]  
Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{approximately } 4.26).
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).  
- **Moles of sodium acetate:**  
  \( 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Total volume of solution:**  
  \( 40 \, \text{cm³} + 10 \, \text{cm³} = 50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L} \).  
- **Concentration of sodium acetate:**  
  \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).  

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}
\]  
The \( \text{Kb} \) for acetate is:  
\[
\text{Kb} = \frac{\text{Kw}}{\text{Ka}} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]  
Using the approximation for weak bases:  
\[
\text{Kb} = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}
\]  
\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}
\]  
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \, (\text{[OH⁻]}).
\]  
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:  
**A) 4.26; 8.52**

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, it's a classic acid-base titration. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. But let's break it down.

First, let's figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is halved because volume doubles. Wait, let me calculate that.

M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, the NaOH will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O. So at any point during the titration, the moles of NaOH added will neutralize some of the acetic acid.

The problem asks for two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. Let's handle them one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate.

But wait, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So, to find the pH at equivalence, we need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate solution. But first, let's find the concentration.

Wait, how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence? Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 cm³) = 0.001 moles. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters? No, wait 1 cm³ is 1 mL, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L? Wait, no, 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L? No, 20 cm³ is 0.02 * 10^-3 = 0.00002 L? Wait, no, wait, volume in liters is cm³ divided by 1000. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L? Wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 * (10^-3 m³) → 0.00002 m³? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1 L = 1000 mL, and 1 cm³ = 1 mL. So 20 cm³ is 20 mL, which is 0.02 L. Oh, okay, I was getting confused.

So moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

But wait, the NaOH is added until 25% titration. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized. So let's proceed.

At equivalence point, the solution is sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate will be same as the moles of acetic acid originally, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume of the solution at equivalence point will be the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added.

Wait, but how much NaOH is added at equivalence? Let me calculate. Moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of sodium acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) will hydrolyze in water as follows: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, so we can use the approximation for weak bases.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02. Setting that equal to 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. This is [OH⁻], so pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ let's compute this.

Log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → approx 0.5175 -6 = -5.4825. So pOH is 5.4825. So pH = 14 -5.4825=8.5175, approximately 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52. Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → equivalence is 8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. So Option A includes 8.52. So equivalence point is 8.52, but wait, wait, no: looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value, which would be the equivalence point. But let me also check the other part of the problem, the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added is 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate.

So, after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate produced are 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. But wait, how much NaOH is added at 25% titration? Since the moles needed for equivalence are 0.001, 0.00025 moles is 25% of that. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³.

So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Now, the concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's find pKa. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so pKa is about (5 - 0.267) =4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256. Approximately 4.26.

Looking back, the options, option A says first value is 4.26 and second is 8.52. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, when we diluted the acetic acid, we had 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles is 0.05 * (20e-3 L) = 0.001 mol. Then when we add 40 mL of solution (20 mL water), the concentration becomes 0.001 / (40e-3) = 0.025 M as I thought.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. Moles of HA left = 0.00075, A- is 0.00025. Volume is 40 + 2.5=42.5 mL.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425 L= 0.017647 M. [A-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647)= pKa + log(0.3333)

pKa is about 4.733 (since 1.85e-5 is Ka). Log(0.3333)= -0.477. So pH is 4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

At equivalence, as calculated earlier, the pH is approximately 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A has those values.

Wait, but wait, the options: Option A is 4.26;8.52. So that's the first and second values.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether I accounted for all the dilutions correctly. Let me recheck the equivalence point.

At equivalence, sodium acetate is 0.001 moles, and the total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH added) =50 mL=0.05 L.

So concentration is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct. Kb is 5.405e-10. So the OH- concentration is sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10). Which is sqrt(1.081e-11)=3.288e-6. So pOH is 5.48, pH is 8.52. So that's correct.

So option A seems correct. But looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dilution step. Let me recheck.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Add 20 cm³ water: total 40 cm³.

So concentration after dilution is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) /40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added: 0.00025. So the volume of NaOH is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³. Correct.

So the total volume is 40+2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425≈0.017647 M, [A-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M. Ratio is 0.333, so pH is 4.73 + log(0.333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253≈4.26.

So the calculations seem correct. So option A is the right answer. But looking back at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches our findings.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. Here's the breakdown:

### Initial Setup
- **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**  
  \( \text{Moles} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).  
- After dilution with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes:  
  \( \text{Concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of NaOH added:**  
  \( 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:**  
  \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed:**  
  \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Total volume of solution:**  
  \( 40 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
- **Concentrations:**  
  \( [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M} \),  
  \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M} \).  

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right)
\]  
The \( \text{pKa} \) is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733
\]  
Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{approximately } 4.26).
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).  
- **Moles of sodium acetate:**  
  \( 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Total volume of solution:**  
  \( 40 \, \text{cm³} + 10 \, \text{cm³} = 50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L} \).  
- **Concentration of sodium acetate:**  
  \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).  

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}
\]  
The \( \text{Kb} \) for acetate is:  
\[
\text{Kb} = \frac{\text{Kw}}{\text{Ka}} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]  
Using the approximation for weak bases:  
\[
\text{Kb} = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}
\]  
\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}
\]  
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \, (\text{[OH⁻]}).
\]  
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:  
**A) 4.26; 8.52**
