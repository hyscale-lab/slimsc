Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see... I'm a bit rusty on my IR and NMR, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that's a key point; the compound has an ester functional group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the splitting. For a para substitution, there are two sets of aromatic protons (the two H on each ortho position would be equivalent), but wait, no, wait. If it's di-substituted, depending on the substituents, the aromatic protons can split into different signals.

Wait, but wait, the compound is di-substituted, but the substituents could be in different positions. For example, if it's para, the aromatic protons would be as two sets, each with two H each. Like if it's two substituents opposite each other, then each of the two ortho positions would have two equivalent H, leading to two doublets each, but in the NMR, they'd be two signals, each integrating as 2H. So that matches the two aromatic signals in the NMR.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then the H at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H at positions 3 and 5 would be another set. So two doublets each, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. So yes, that fits.

Next, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R, but no, ester is R-O-CO-R. The structure of an ester is RCOOR', so the carbonyl is between the two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', right? So the carbonyl is adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, but where would the vinyl-H come from? Vinyl is CH₂=CH-. Oh, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are groups that have double bonds. Like maybe an ester group attached via a vinyl group? Or maybe the substituents are ester groups themselves, perhaps as substituents on the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ester groups attached in such a way that there's a vinyl group attached. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests a coupling between two different sets of H. For example, in a trans- configuration, or perhaps in a conjugated system. Like in a trans double bond, the Hs on each carbon are split into doublets. Or maybe it's in a more complex environment.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are ester groups that have a vinyl group attached. For example, if one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH₂=CHCOOR. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, something like CH₂=CHCOO-R attached to the ring. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets (a doublet split into four) suggests that each proton is coupling with two sets of equivalent protons. Hmm... Or perhaps it's a trans coupling in a di-substituted double bond.

Wait, another thought: an ester group is O-CO-O, but perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ring with a vinyl group attached. Wait, let me think about the structure.

Wait, the di-substituted benzene with an ester group. So, for example, one substituent could be an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. But wait, no, ester groups are O-CO-O-R attached to an R group. So maybe one substituent is an ester group connected via an oxygen, like O-CO-O-R, but that might not have vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH₂=CHCOO-R attached to the ring. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has two signals for CH3 groups. Two signals? So two different CH3 groups. That suggests two distinct methyl groups in the structure. For example, maybe an ester group where one R is a methyl and the other is another group.

Wait, but the problem states that there are six signals in the 1H NMR. Let's tally:

- 2 aromatic H signals → total 4H (since each is 2H)
- 2 vinyl H → let's say 2H (each signal could be 1H each, but more likely each is 2H)
Wait, no, the question says 'two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)'. So perhaps each is 2H? Hmm. Wait, maybe each is a pair of H. For example, in a trans double bond, each H is a doublet. Wait, but in a vinyl group like CH2=CH-, each CH2 has two H, and the CH has one H. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-something attached to the ring.

Wait, let me think about the entire structure. Let's imagine the benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, maybe something like OCOOR, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, or perhaps a substituent that includes a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ester groups themselves. Wait, but the IR shows an ester, so only one ester group is present.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. For example, one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other is a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, if one substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- attached to the ring), and the other is an ester.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl-H, so the substituent must contain a double bond. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group, or the substituent itself is a vinyl ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not directly the ester but something that includes an ester group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two ester groups. But the problem says it's a di-substituted ring, so two substituents. But the IR only shows an ester, so maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows six signals. Let's think about the integration. The aromatic Hs are two signals, so likely 2 H each (since the ring is di-substituted, and each set is 2 H). Then the vinyl Hs: perhaps each is 2 H. Wait, but a vinyl group like CH2=CH- would have two sets of H: the CH2 and the CH. So the CH2 would be a quartet (from coupling with the CH), and the CH would be a doublet. Wait, but in the NMR, it's two signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is in a trans configuration, each H coupling with two others.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have a vinyl group adjacent to the ester. Like CH₂=CHCOO-R attached to the benzene ring. That would give vinyl Hs as a doublet and a quartet.

Wait, let's think about the structure of a propenoate ester. Structure would be CH₂=CHCOOR attached to the benzene. The vinyl protons would be on the CH₂ and the CH of the CH₂=CH- group.

In such a case, the H on the CH₂ would be a quartet because they couple with the CH H (doublet). The H on the CH (the =CH-) would be a doublet because they couple with the CH₂ H. So the NMR would show a quartet and a doublet.

Wait, but the problem states that the vinyl Hs are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent is something like CH₂=CH-O-CO-O-R? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows two CH3 signals. So there are two different methyl groups. For example, one methyl could be from an ester group (like OCOOCH3) and another methyl from another part of the molecule.

Wait, no, wait. If the ester is OCOOR, and R is a methyl group, then the ester would have a OCH3 group. But that would be a singlet in the NMR because OCH3 is usually a singlet. But in the problem, the CH3 signals are two, so maybe the substituent is an ester with a longer chain, like OCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group, not a methyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and another substituent is a methyl group. But wait, the NMR says two CH3 signals. So maybe the structure has two methyl groups in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester and a vinyl group, and the vinyl group is connected to a methyl group. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

The benzene ring has 3 degrees of unsaturation (since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring with three double bonds). Each substituent adds to this.

Wait, the ester group is OCOOR. So the ester contributes a carbonyl group (1 degree of unsaturation) and an ether-like linkage (but that's not an additional degree since it's a single bond).

The substituent with the vinyl group would contribute another degree of unsaturation (the double bond). So total degrees of unsaturation would be 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 1 (vinyl double bond) = 5.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, the formula would be:

For each compound:

Let's calculate for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2 → DoU = (2*11 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 → (24-14)/2=5 → DoU=5.

Option B: C12H14O2 → DoU=(2*12+2-14)/2=(26-14)=12 → 12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2 → (2*12+2-12)= (26-12)=14 →14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → (2*11+2-12)= (24-12)=12 →12/2=6.

Wait, but the structure should have 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 1 (vinyl) = 5 DoU. So the correct compound should have DoU=5. Let's see which options have that.

Option A: DoU 5 → correct.

Option B: 6 → too much.

Option C:7 → no.

Option D:6 → no.

So the correct formula must be option A: C11H14O2.

Wait, but let's double-check. The benzene has 3 DoU. The ester has a carbonyl (1), and the vinyl has a double bond (1). So 3+1+1=5, which matches option A.

So the formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

But wait, let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic signals would depend on the substituents. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic Hs would give two signals, each integrating as 2H. That matches the NMR description.

The vinyl Hs would come from a group like CH₂=CH-. If the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH₂=CHCOO-R, then the vinyl Hs would be as follows: the CH₂ would be a quartet (coupling with the CH), and the CH would be a triplet (coupling with the CH₂). Wait, but the problem states one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is attached in a way that the vinyl group is adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an allyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester with a vinyl group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but the DoU calculation suggests option A is correct.

Wait, another thing: the molecular formula for option A is C11H14O2. Benzene is C6H6. The substituents would add 5 carbons and 8 hydrogens, plus 2 oxygens.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is something like benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (like OCOOCH3) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH₂=CH2). Wait, but CH₂=CH2 would be ethylene, but that's not connected to anything. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a propenoate group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, one substituent is OCOOCH3 (methyl ester), and the other is CH₂=CHCH2-. Hmm, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, maybe each substituent is an ester group with a methyl group. Wait, no, because the ester would be OCOOR. If R is methyl, then OCOOCH3, which is a methyl ester. So each substituent would be a methyl ester, but that would give two ester groups, which would mean the IR would show maybe two carbonyl peaks, but the question says only an ester peak is present. So perhaps only one ester group.

This is getting a bit complicated, but given the DoU calculation, option A (C11H14O2) seems to fit. The H count: Benzene is 6 H. Two substituents: let's say one is a methyl ester (OCOOCH3) which would add 3 H (from the methyl), and another substituent that's a vinyl group with some Hs.

Wait, the substituents would contribute their own Hs. Let's think: if one substituent is OCOOCH3, that's 3 H from the methyl. The other substituent is a vinyl group, say CH2=CH- attached to the ring. That would contribute 4 H (the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H, but wait, each CH would have 1 H, but perhaps it's CH2=CH-R). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let's outline the possible structure. Let's say the benzene has two substituents: one is OCOOR (ester) and the other is CH2CH2 (but that's a single bond, so no vinyl Hs). Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is OCOOR and the other is CH2=CH-R. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the NMR signals.

Aromatic Hs: two signals, each 2H. So substituents are in para positions, each causing the adjacent Hs to split into two sets, each with 2H.

Vinyl Hs: one doublet (maybe the CH) and one doublet of quartets (the CH2, which is split by the CH's H). So the doublet of quartets comes from each CH2 H coupling with the CH H (doublet) and possibly another coupling.

Wait, but then the CH2 would have two Hs, each of which is split into a quartet by the CH (which has two Hs?), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group adjacent to another group. But I'm not making progress there.

In any case, the DoU calculation suggests option A is correct. So the formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum showing a carbonyl stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic-H signals**: Two signals, corresponding to 2 sets of aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, where the two substituents are opposite each other, splitting the aromatic protons into two equivalent sets.

2. **Vinyl-H signals**: Two signals—one is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) in the structure. The doublet corresponds to the CH group, while the doublet of quartets corresponds to the CH₂ group, which is split by coupling with the CH group.

3. **Methyl (CH₃) signals**: Two signals, indicating the presence of two distinct methyl groups in different environments. This suggests that the molecule contains two methyl groups, possibly from an ester group and another part of the structure.

The molecular formula must account for the degrees of unsaturation (DoU). The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester carbonyl contributes 1, and the vinyl double bond contributes 1, for a total of 5 DoU. Calculating the DoU for each option:

- **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 11 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (24 - 14) / 2 = 5.  
  This matches the required 5 DoU.

- **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 12 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (26 - 14) / 2 = 6.  
  Exceeds the required 5 DoU.

- **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 12 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (26 - 12) / 2 = 7.  
  Exceeds the required 5 DoU.

- **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (24 - 12) / 2 = 6.  
  Exceeds the required 5 DoU.

Thus, the correct molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**, which corresponds to **Option A**. This formula aligns with the spectroscopic data and the calculated degrees of unsaturation.

Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see... I'm a bit rusty on my IR and NMR, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that's a key point; the compound has an ester functional group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the splitting. For a para substitution, there are two sets of aromatic protons (the two H on each ortho position would be equivalent), but wait, no, wait. If it's di-substituted, depending on the substituents, the aromatic protons can split into different signals.

Wait, but wait, the compound is di-substituted, but the substituents could be in different positions. For example, if it's para, the aromatic protons would be as two sets, each with two H each. Like if it's two substituents opposite each other, then each of the two ortho positions would have two equivalent H, leading to two doublets each, but in the NMR, they'd be two signals, each integrating as 2H. So that matches the two aromatic signals in the NMR.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then the H at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H at positions 3 and 5 would be another set. So two doublets each, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. So yes, that fits.

Next, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R, but no, ester is R-O-CO-R. The structure of an ester is RCOOR', so the carbonyl is between the two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', right? So the carbonyl is adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, but where would the vinyl-H come from? Vinyl is CH₂=CH-. Oh, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are groups that have double bonds. Like maybe an ester group attached via a vinyl group? Or maybe the substituents are ester groups themselves, perhaps as substituents on the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ester groups attached in such a way that there's a vinyl group attached. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests a coupling between two different sets of H. For example, in a trans- configuration, or perhaps in a conjugated system. Like in a trans double bond, the Hs on each carbon are split into doublets. Or maybe it's in a more complex environment.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are ester groups that have a vinyl group attached. For example, if one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH₂=CHCOOR. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, something like CH₂=CHCOO-R attached to the ring. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets (a doublet split into four) suggests that each proton is coupling with two sets of equivalent protons. Hmm... Or perhaps it's a trans coupling in a di-substituted double bond.

Wait, another thought: an ester group is O-CO-O, but perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ring with a vinyl group attached. Wait, let me think about the structure.

Wait, the di-substituted benzene with an ester group. So, for example, one substituent could be an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. But wait, no, ester groups are O-CO-O-R attached to an R group. So maybe one substituent is an ester group connected via an oxygen, like O-CO-O-R, but that might not have vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH₂=CHCOO-R attached to the ring. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has two signals for CH3 groups. Two signals? So two different CH3 groups. That suggests two distinct methyl groups in the structure. For example, maybe an ester group where one R is a methyl and the other is another group.

Wait, but the problem states that there are six signals in the 1H NMR. Let's tally:

- 2 aromatic H signals → total 4H (since each is 2H)
- 2 vinyl H → let's say 2H (each signal could be 1H each, but more likely each is 2H)
Wait, no, the question says 'two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)'. So perhaps each is 2H? Hmm. Wait, maybe each is a pair of H. For example, in a trans double bond, each H is a doublet. Wait, but in a vinyl group like CH2=CH-, each CH2 has two H, and the CH has one H. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-something attached to the ring.

Wait, let me think about the entire structure. Let's imagine the benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, maybe something like OCOOR, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, or perhaps a substituent that includes a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ester groups themselves. Wait, but the IR shows an ester, so only one ester group is present.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. For example, one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other is a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, if one substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- attached to the ring), and the other is an ester.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl-H, so the substituent must contain a double bond. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group, or the substituent itself is a vinyl ester.

Wait, but the NMR shows six signals. Let's think about the integration. The aromatic Hs are two signals, so likely 2 H each (since the ring is di-substituted, and each set is 2 H). Then the vinyl Hs: perhaps each is 2 H. Wait, but a vinyl group like CH2=CH- would have two sets of H: the CH2 and the CH. So the CH2 would be a quartet (from coupling with the CH), and the CH would be a doublet. Wait, but in the NMR, it's two signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is in a trans configuration, each H coupling with two others.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have a vinyl group adjacent to the ester. Like CH₂=CHCOO-R attached to the benzene ring. That would give vinyl Hs as a doublet and a quartet.

Wait, let's think about the structure of a propenoate ester. Structure would be CH₂=CHCOOR attached to the benzene. The vinyl protons would be on the CH₂ and the CH of the CH₂=CH- group.

In such a case, the H on the CH₂ would be a quartet because they couple with the CH H (doublet). The H on the CH (the =CH-) would be a doublet because they couple with the CH₂ H. So the NMR would show a quartet and a doublet.

Wait, but the problem states that the vinyl Hs are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent is something like CH₂=CH-O-CO-O-R? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows two CH3 signals. So there are two different methyl groups. For example, one methyl could be from an ester group (like OCOOCH3) and another methyl from another part of the molecule.

Wait, no, wait. If the ester is OCOOR, and R is a methyl group, then the ester would have a OCH3 group. But that would be a singlet in the NMR because OCH3 is usually a singlet. But in the problem, the CH3 signals are two, so maybe the substituent is an ester with a longer chain, like OCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group, not a methyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and another substituent is a methyl group. But wait, the NMR says two CH3 signals. So maybe the structure has two methyl groups in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester and a vinyl group, and the vinyl group is connected to a methyl group. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

The benzene ring has 3 degrees of unsaturation (since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring with three double bonds). Each substituent adds to this.

Wait, the ester group is OCOOR. So the ester contributes a carbonyl group (1 degree of unsaturation) and an ether-like linkage (but that's not an additional degree since it's a single bond).

The substituent with the vinyl group would contribute another degree of unsaturation (the double bond). So total degrees of unsaturation would be 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 1 (vinyl double bond) = 5.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, the formula would be:

For each compound:

Let's calculate for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2 → DoU = (2*11 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 → (24-14)/2=5 → DoU=5.

Option B: C12H14O2 → DoU=(2*12+2-14)/2=(26-14)=12 → 12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2 → (2*12+2-12)= (26-12)=14 →14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → (2*11+2-12)= (24-12)=12 →12/2=6.

Wait, but the structure should have 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 1 (vinyl) = 5 DoU. So the correct compound should have DoU=5. Let's see which options have that.

Option A: DoU 5 → correct.

Option B: 6 → too much.

Option C:7 → no.

Option D:6 → no.

So the correct formula must be option A: C11H14O2.

Wait, but let's double-check. The benzene has 3 DoU. The ester has a carbonyl (1), and the vinyl has a double bond (1). So 3+1+1=5, which matches option A.

So the formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

But wait, let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic signals would depend on the substituents. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic Hs would give two signals, each integrating as 2H. That matches the NMR description.

The vinyl Hs would come from a group like CH₂=CH-. If the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH₂=CHCOO-R, then the vinyl Hs would be as follows: the CH₂ would be a quartet (coupling with the CH), and the CH would be a triplet (coupling with the CH₂). Wait, but the problem states one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is attached in a way that the vinyl group is adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an allyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester with a vinyl group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but the DoU calculation suggests option A is correct.

Wait, another thing: the molecular formula for option A is C11H14O2. Benzene is C6H6. The substituents would add 5 carbons and 8 hydrogens, plus 2 oxygens.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is something like benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (like OCOOCH3) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH₂=CH2). Wait, but CH₂=CH2 would be ethylene, but that's not connected to anything. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a propenoate group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, one substituent is OCOOCH3 (methyl ester), and the other is CH₂=CHCH2-. Hmm, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, maybe each substituent is an ester group with a methyl group. Wait, no, because the ester would be OCOOR. If R is methyl, then OCOOCH3, which is a methyl ester. So each substituent would be a methyl ester, but that would give two ester groups, which would mean the IR would show maybe two carbonyl peaks, but the question says only an ester peak is present. So perhaps only one ester group.

This is getting a bit complicated, but given the DoU calculation, option A (C11H14O2) seems to fit. The H count: Benzene is 6 H. Two substituents: let's say one is a methyl ester (OCOOCH3) which would add 3 H (from the methyl), and another substituent that's a vinyl group with some Hs.

Wait, the substituents would contribute their own Hs. Let's think: if one substituent is OCOOCH3, that's 3 H from the methyl. The other substituent is a vinyl group, say CH2=CH- attached to the ring. That would contribute 4 H (the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H, but wait, each CH would have 1 H, but perhaps it's CH2=CH-R). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let's outline the possible structure. Let's say the benzene has two substituents: one is OCOOR (ester) and the other is CH2CH2 (but that's a single bond, so no vinyl Hs). Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is OCOOR and the other is CH2=CH-R. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the NMR signals.

Aromatic Hs: two signals, each 2H. So substituents are in para positions, each causing the adjacent Hs to split into two sets, each with 2H.

Vinyl Hs: one doublet (maybe the CH) and one doublet of quartets (the CH2, which is split by the CH's H). So the doublet of quartets comes from each CH2 H coupling with the CH H (doublet) and possibly another coupling.

Wait, but then the CH2 would have two Hs, each of which is split into a quartet by the CH (which has two Hs?), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group adjacent to another group. But I'm not making progress there.

In any case, the DoU calculation suggests option A is correct. So the formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum showing a carbonyl stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic-H signals**: Two signals, corresponding to 2 sets of aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, where the two substituents are opposite each other, splitting the aromatic protons into two equivalent sets.

2. **Vinyl-H signals**: Two signals—one is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) in the structure. The doublet corresponds to the CH group, while the doublet of quartets corresponds to the CH₂ group, which is split by coupling with the CH group.

3. **Methyl (CH₃) signals**: Two signals, indicating the presence of two distinct methyl groups in different environments. This suggests that the molecule contains two methyl groups, possibly from an ester group and another part of the structure.

The molecular formula must account for the degrees of unsaturation (DoU). The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester carbonyl contributes 1, and the vinyl double bond contributes 1, for a total of 5 DoU. Calculating the DoU for each option:

- **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 11 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (24 - 14) / 2 = 5.  
  This matches the required 5 DoU.

- **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 12 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (26 - 14) / 2 = 6.  
  Exceeds the required 5 DoU.

- **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 12 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (26 - 12) / 2 = 7.  
  Exceeds the required 5 DoU.

- **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**:  
  DoU = (2 × 11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (24 - 12) / 2 = 6.  
  Exceeds the required 5 DoU.

Thus, the correct molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**, which corresponds to **Option A**. This formula aligns with the spectroscopic data and the calculated degrees of unsaturation.
