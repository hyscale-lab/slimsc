Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, the system consists of 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. All charges are identical, each with charge 2e. Since all the charges are the same sign, they will repel each other. But since the 12 are constrained at a fixed distance, maybe their configuration is such that they form a regular structure, like a regular dodecahedron or something similar. But since their exact arrangement isn't specified, perhaps the problem is assuming they are all at the same point 2 meters from P, but arranged symmetrically. Wait, but for the potential energy calculation, the arrangement might not matter because we're considering the potential energy between each pair.

Wait, but potential energy in electrostatics is a pairwise thing. So, for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, the formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij) for all i < j.

In this case, all the charges are 2e each, so q_i = q_j = 2e for each pair. The distance r_ij between any two charges: well, the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but what's their mutual distance? Wait, if all 12 are at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances might vary depending on how they're arranged. But maybe the problem simplifies by assuming that each of the 12 is at 2m from P, and the distance between any two of them is also 2m? No, wait, that can't be right because if you have multiple points all at 2m from a central point, their mutual distances vary depending on the angle between them. But perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distance between any two of the 12 is 2m? That would be a big assumption, but maybe that's what's intended here.

Wait, no, that's probably not correct. Because if all 12 charges are placed on a sphere of radius 2m around P, their mutual distances would vary. For example, two adjacent charges on the sphere would be a certain distance apart, but two diametrically opposite charges would be 4 meters apart. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. But maybe the problem is expecting a simplified approach, considering only the potential between each charge and the fixed charge at P, and not the potential between the other 12 charges. Hmm, but that would ignore the interactions among the 12 charges. Since the problem is about the minimum energy of the system, perhaps we can consider the configuration where the potential energy is minimized. But wait, for like charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But since their positions are constrained, maybe the system is in a state where the charges are as spread out as possible to minimize the repulsion, thus minimizing the potential energy. Wait, but since they are identical and like charges, the potential energy between them would be positive because all interactions are repulsive.

Wait, the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. Since all the charges are positive (as they are 2e, and e is positive), each pair contributes a positive term. So the total potential energy of the system is the sum of all these positive terms, leading to a positive total energy. So the system's potential energy is positive, meaning it's in an unstable configuration. But the question is asking for the minimum energy. Hmm, but wait: since all the charges are fixed (the 12 at 2m from P, and the 13th fixed at P), perhaps the potential energy is fixed as well. Oh, because the system is isolated and the charges are constrained, their positions can't change, so their potential energy is fixed. So the minimum energy would be the total potential energy of the system.

Wait, but how to compute that. Let me break it down:

The total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So, how many pairs are there?

There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So first, compute the potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the other 12 charges.

Each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, so the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of them is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e)/(2 m). Wait, wait: charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e. So each such pair contributes U = k * (2e)^2 / (2), where k = 1/(4πε₀).

Wait, let me compute that. But wait, how many such pairs are there? The fixed charge at P is interacting with each of the 12 charges, so that's 12 pairs. So the potential energy from these would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Now, we also have to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each pair among the 12 contributes to the potential energy. How many such pairs are there? For 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is (12 choose 2) = (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs. Each of these pairs is between two charges located 2 meters apart (if the problem assumes that all 12 charges are at 2m from P and their mutual distances are 2m, which, as I thought earlier, may not be the case, but perhaps the problem is making that assumption).

Wait, but if the 12 charges are arranged in a sphere around P, their mutual distances vary. For example, if two charges are on opposite ends of a diameter, their distance is 4 meters. But for adjacent charges, the distance would be 2 * 2 * sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between them as seen from P. Hmm, but without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other. Which would be a very symmetrical arrangement, but perhaps not physically possible because if you have 12 points on a sphere, each adjacent pair can't all be 2m apart. Because the radius is 2m, so the maximum distance between two points on the sphere is 4m (diametrically opposite). But for any two adjacent points, the chord length would be 2 * r * sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between them. But for 12 points on a sphere, say, like the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the angles would not be such that all the mutual distances are equal. So perhaps the problem is making a mistake, or maybe it's assuming that all the 12 charges are at a distance of 2m from each other. Alternatively, perhaps it's assuming that the mutual distance between any two of the 12 charges is 2m, but that's impossible because if all are on a sphere of radius 2m, then the maximum possible distance between any two is 4m, but the minimum would be greater than zero. Wait, but arranging 12 points on a sphere such that each pair is exactly 2m apart—would that even be possible? Let me think: the chord length between two points on a sphere of radius r is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between them. So if the chord length is 2m, and r is 2m, then 2 = 2 * 2 * sin(θ/2) → 2 =4 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2)=0.5 → θ/2=30 degrees → θ=60 degrees. So each pair would be separated by 60 degrees on the sphere. But wait, how many points can you arrange on a sphere such that each pair is 60 degrees apart? That's the question of spherical codes. I think for 12 points, it's possible to arrange them as the vertices of a regular icosahedron, but in that case, the angles between some pairs would be larger than others. So perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that all mutual distances between the 12 charges are 2m. That might be the approach expected here.

Assuming that, then each of the 66 pairs contributes U = k*(2e)^2/(2 m) → since r=2 m.

So the total potential energy would be the sum of all these.

So let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the number of fixed-charge interactions: 12 pairs, each with r=2 m.

Each such pair's potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)^2 / 2 → which is ( (2e)^2 )/(4πε₀ * 2) → (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀) → e²/(2 π ε₀).

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, the formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

So q1 = q2 = 2e. So U for one pair is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / (2 m) → which simplifies to (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) → e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the denominator. Wait, 2 m is the distance. So when I plug in, it's (2e)(2e) = 4 e², and denominator is 4 π ε₀ * 2 m → 8 π ε₀ m. So 4e²/(8 π ε₀ m) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

So each of the 12 pairs contributes this. So the total for these is 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ m)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2e multiplied by 2e is 4e², and divided by (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) → which is 8 π ε₀ m. So 4e²/(8 π ε₀ m) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m). So each of the 12 pairs contributes e²/(2 π ε₀ m) per pair. So 12 pairs would contribute 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ m)).

Wait, but wait, no: the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2 m. So each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th charge, so 12 interactions, each with r=2 m.

So U1 = 12 * [ (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / 2 ] = 12 * [ (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) ] = 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀)).

Wait, but wait, 2e * 2e = 4 e², divided by (4π ε₀ * 2) → denominator is 8 π ε₀. So 4 e² / (8 π ε₀) = e²/(2 π ε₀). So for each of the 12, that's U_i = e²/(2 π ε₀). So 12 * U_i = 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀) = (6 e²)/π ε₀.

Now, the second part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each pair is at a distance of 2 m, so U_ij for each pair is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e)/2 → which is same as each of the U_i terms above. So each pair contributes e²/(2 π ε₀ m) → wait no, the denominator is 4 π ε₀ *2, so same as before.

Wait, each pair among the 12 charges is at 2 m, so U_ij = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e)/2 → which is (4e²)/(8 π ε₀) ) → e²/(2 π ε₀). So each of the 66 pairs contributes e²/(2 π ε₀). So the total for this part is 66 * e²/(2 π ε₀) = 33 e²/(π ε₀).

So the total potential energy U_total is U1 + U2 = (6 e²)/(π ε₀) + (33 e²)/(π ε₀) )= (39 e²)/(π ε₀) .

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate.

Wait, U1 is 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ m)) ? No, wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. The 12 charges each at 2 m from P, each interacting with the fixed charge (P) which is 2e. So each such pair contributes U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e)/(2 m) → which is (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) → e²/(2 π ε₀ m). So each of the 12 pairs contributes e²/(2 π ε₀ m). Wait, but wait, the denominator r is 2 m, so that term is correct.

Wait, but 2e * 2e is 4 e². Divided by (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) → 8 π ε₀ m. So 4 e² / 8 π ε₀ m → e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

So U1 is 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀ m) → (12 e²) / (2 π ε₀ m) → 6 e²/(π ε₀ m). Wait, no, because 12 times e²/(2 π ε₀ m) is 6 e²/(π ε₀ m). Wait, but wait, m is 2 meters? No, wait: the 'm' here is the distance between the charges. Wait, the distance is 2 meters, so the denominator is 2 meters. So the 'm' in the denominator is 2 m. So the U1 is 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ * 2 m)) ?

Wait, no, wait, no. I think I'm mixing the variables. Let me correct this.

Each pair between the fixed charge and the 12: each is at a distance r = 2 m. So, the energy for each is U = (1/(4πε_0)) * (2e)(2e) / (2) → 4 e² / (8 π ε_0) ) → e²/(2 π ε_0). So each such pair contributes e²/(2 π ε_0). So for 12 pairs, U1 = 12 * e²/(2 π ε_0) = 6 e²/(π ε_0).

Then, for the pairs among the 12 charges: each is at a distance of 2 m. So each pair contributes U = (1/(4πε_0)) * (2e)(2e)/2 → same as before, e²/(2 π ε_0). So for 66 pairs, U2 = 66 * e²/(2 π ε_0) → 33 e²/(π ε_0).

So total U = U1 + U2 = (6 e²/(π ε_0)) + (33 e²/(π ε_0)) ) = (39 e²)/(π ε_0).

Wait, that seems high. Let me confirm: 12 pairs each contributing e²/(2 π ε_0) → sum is 12 * e²/(2 π ε_0) → which is 6 e²/(π ε_0).

66 pairs, each contributing e²/(2 π ε_0) → sum is 66 * e²/(2 π ε_0) → 33 e²/(π ε_0).

Adding them: 6 +33 = 39 → 39 e²/(π ε_0).

So the total potential energy is U = (39 e²) / (π ε_0).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions for U2. Let me think again: 12 charges, number of pairs is (12 * 11)/2 = 66. So 66 pairs. Each with U = e²/(2 π ε_0). So 66 * e²/(2 π ε_0) = 33 e²/(π ε_0).

Yes.

So U = 39 e²/(π ε_0).

Now, I need to compute this value numerically.

First, I'll recall the value of e, the elementary charge: e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10^-19 coulombs.

ε_0, the vacuum permittivity, is approximately 8.854187817 × 10^-12 F/m (farads per meter).

So, e² = (1.602e-19 C)^2 → approximately (2.566e-38 C²).

So, let's compute:

e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 → approximately 2.56697e-38 C².

Now, compute 39 e² / (π ε_0):

39 * 2.56697e-38 / (π * 8.854187817e-12).

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 39 * 2.56697e-38 = let's compute 39 * 2.56697 = approximately 39 * 2.567 = 100.113 → so 100.113e-38 = 1.00113e-36.

Denominator: π * 8.854187817e-12 ≈ 3.14159265 * 8.854187817e-12 ≈ 2.783e-11.

So, U = (1.00113e-36) / (2.783e-11) ≈ (1.00113 / 2.783) )e-25 → approximately 0.359e-25 → 3.59e-26 J.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Compute 39 * 2.56697e-38:

39 × 2.56697 = let's compute 40 × 2.56697 = 102.6788, then subtract 1 × 2.56697 → 102.6788 -2.56697=100.11183. So 100.11183e-38 → 1.0011183e-36.

Denominator: π × 8.854187817e-12 = ?

Compute 8.854187817e-12 × 3.14159265:

Let me compute 8.854187817 × 3.14159265 ≈ 27.827 approximately.

So, 27.827e-12 → 2.7827e-11.

So, U = (1.0011183e-36) / (2.7827e-11) → Let's compute 1.0011183e-36 ÷ 2.7827e-11.

That's equal to (1.0011183 / 2.7827) ) × 1e-36+11 → (0.3595) × 1e-25 → 3.595e-26 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, option A is 5.645e-26, option C is 7.056e-27.

Hmm, 3.595e-26 isn't exactly matching any option. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Maybe they are not all 2m apart. Let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, the 12 charges are 'constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P.' So each of the 12 is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances would vary. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, but not among themselves. Because if the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, their mutual distances are not all 2m, so the problem might not require considering those interactions.

Wait, but that's a big point. If the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified, perhaps the problem only wants us to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. In that case, the mutual interactions among the 12 charges would be ignored, reducing the calculation.

Wait, because the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But wait, mutual potential energy for like charges is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But since they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, the mutual distances between them can't be controlled. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero. Or maybe the problem is making an oversight by not considering those interactions.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the mutual potential energy is part of the system's total energy, so the problem must be expecting us to include it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The system comprises a fixed charge at P and other 12 charges each at 2m from P. The fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each of the 12 interacts with the fixed charge. So, the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is U = (k * (2e)(2e)) / 2 → which is (4 e² k) / 2 → 2 e² k, where k = 1/(4 π ε_0).

Wait, no: k is 1/(4 π ε_0), so U = (k * (2e)(2e)) / r → r=2 m. So U = (4 e² k) / (2) → 2 e² k.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 e² k. So 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Now, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

If the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, each at 2m distance, then their mutual distances vary. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps the mutual distances are such that each pair is at a certain average distance. But that's not provided, making the problem incomplete. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 m, but as I thought earlier, that's impossible for more than two charges. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and only consider their potential energy with the fixed charge.

If that's the case, then the total potential energy is just the sum of the 12 individual interactions. Let me compute that.

So U = 12 * (k * (2e)(2e) ) / 2 → 12 * (4 e² k) / 2 → 12 * 2 e² k → 24 e² k.

So, now, let's compute 24 e² k.

k is 1/(4 π ε_0) ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

So, 24 * e² * k = 24 * (2.566e-38) * (8.988e9).

Compute step by step:

24 * 2.566e-38 = 61.584e-38 = 6.1584e-37.

6.1584e-37 * 8.988e9 = ?

Multiply 6.1584e-37 by 8.988e9:

6.1584 * 8.988 ≈ 55.41 (since 6 *9=54, 0.1584*9≈1.4256 → ~55.4256).

The exponents: 1e-37 * 1e9 = 1e-28.

So 55.4256e-28 → 5.54256e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, etc. So 5.54e-27 isn't matching any option. So perhaps the mutual interactions are not to be considered, but perhaps I've made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 24 * e² * k.

24 * (2.566e-38 C²) * (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) → units would be N·m², but since energy is in J (N·m), let me compute the numerical value.

So, 24 * 2.566e-38 = 61.584e-38 → 6.1584e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 6.1584e-37 * 8.988e9 = ?

6.1584 * 8.988 ≈ Let me compute:

6 *8.988=53.928.

0.1584 *8.988 ≈ 1.424.

So total ≈53.928 +1.424=55.352.

So 55.352e-37+9 → 55.352e-28 → 5.5352e-27 J.

Wait, but this isn't matching any option.

Wait, maybe I confused the number of interactions. The problem states that the 13th charge is fixed, and 12 are at 2m from P. So the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / 2 m.

Which is (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀).

So per pair: 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀) → 6 e²/(π ε₀).

Wait, let me compute 6 e²/(π ε₀).

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

π ≈3.1416, ε₀=8.854e-12 F/m.

So 6 * 2.566e-38 / (3.1416 * 8.854e-12).

Compute denominator: 3.1416 *8.854e-12 ≈27.83e-12 → 2.783e-11.

So numerator: 6 * 2.566e-38 =15.396e-38 →1.5396e-37.

So 1.5396e-37 / 2.783e-11 = (1.5396 / 2.783) )e-26 → approximately 0.553e-26 →5.53e-27 J.

Which again is about 5.53e-27 J. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Looking back at the options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than 5.53e-27.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me check the initial steps again.

Each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from P. The fixed charge is at P. So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy with the fixed charge as U = (1/(4πε₀))*(2e)(2e)/(2 m).

Which is (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) → e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

Wait, no: 2 m is the distance, so denominator is 2 m, not just m. So perhaps I made a mistake by not including the 2m in the denominator.

Wait, yes! Oh no, I think I found the mistake.

I think I messed up the calculation earlier by not including the 2m correctly.

So, the correct approach is: U for each pair between P and the 12 charges is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / (2 m).

Which is (4 e²) / (8 π ε_0 m) → e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

So, for each of the 12 pairs, U is e²/(2 π ε_0 * 2 m), because r=2 m.

Wait, wait, no: the denominator is 4 π ε_0 multiplied by r, which is 2 m. So the denominator is 4 π ε_0 * 2 m.

So, U = (4 e²) / (8 π ε_0 m) → simplifies to e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

Wait, but m is the unit of meters, not mass. So, perhaps I should have used 'r' instead of 'm'. But regardless, the calculation is:

Each pair contributes U = (4 e²) / (8 π ε_0) ) → because 2 m is the distance.

Wait, 2e * 2e =4 e². Divided by (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) → 8 π ε₀ m. So 4 e²/(8 π ε₀ m) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

So, each of the 12 pairs contributes e²/(2 π ε₀ * 2) → because m=2 m? No, the denominator is 4 π ε₀ multiplied by the distance, which is 2 m. So, the denominator is 8 π ε₀.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to compute it again.

The potential energy for each pair (fixed charge and one of the 12):

U = (1/(4πε_0)) * (2e)(2e)/(2 m), where m is 2 meters.

So, U = (4 e²) / (8 π ε_0 m) → e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

Wait, but m is 2 meters, so substituting m=2 m:

U = e²/(2 π ε_0 * 2) → e²/(4 π ε_0).

Wait, that can't be right. Because 2 meters is the distance, so the denominator is 4 π ε_0 * 2 m → which is 8 π ε_0 m. So 4 e² / 8 π ε_0 m → e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

But m is 2 meters, so U = e²/(2 π ε_0 * 2) → e²/(4 π ε_0).

Wait, but wait, 4 e² / (4 π ε_0 * 2 m) → because r=2 m.

So, U = (4 e²) / (8 π ε_0 m) → e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

But when m is 2 meters, this becomes e²/(4 π ε_0).

Wait, but this would be the same as 39 e²/(4 π ε_0) if we include all interactions. But this is getting a bit messy.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12. Each contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e)/(2) meters.

So, (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) → (e²) / (2 π ε₀).

So, 12 pairs contribute 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀) = 6 e²/(π ε₀).

Now, for the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, assuming each pair is at 2 meters apart, each contributes e²/(2 π ε₀). So 66 pairs contribute 66 * e²/(2 π ε₀) = 33 e²/(π ε₀).

Total U = 6 e²/(π ε₀) + 33 e²/(π ε₀) = 39 e²/(π ε₀).

Now, compute 39 * (1.602e-19)^2 / (π * 8.854e-12).

Compute e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So numerator: 39 * 2.566e-38 = 100.074e-38 → 1.00074e-36.

Denominator: π * 8.854e-12 ≈ 27.83e-12 → 2.783e-11.

So, U = 1.00074e-36 / 2.783e-11 → approximately 3.594e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, option B is 2.822e-26, option C is 7.056e-27.

Hmm, 3.594e-26 isn't any of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mutual distances.

Alternative possibility: The mutual distances between the 12 charges are not all 2 meters.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point 2 meters from P, so their mutual distance is zero. But that can't be because like charges would repel, but if they are fixed, perhaps they are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters. But that's not possible because more than two points can't all be at the same distance from a central point and have mutual distances of 2m. So perhaps the mutual distances vary, but the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge. In that case, the mutual potential energies are ignored, perhaps.

In that case, the total U would be 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀)).

Wait, let me compute that: 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀) = 6 e²/(π ε₀).

So, compute 6 * (1.602e-19)^2 / (π *8.854e-12).

e² = 2.566e-38.

6 * 2.566e-38 = 15.396e-38 → 1.5396e-37.

Denominator: same as before, 2.783e-11.

So U = 1.5396e-37 / 2.783e-11 → approximately 5.53e-27 J.

Which is 5.53e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit larger. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in including all mutual interactions. Wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so perhaps the mutual interactions are to be considered. But earlier, when we included all mutual interactions, the U came out to be 3.59e-26 J, which isn't an option. But maybe I should check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about half of 5.645e-26. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when considering the mutual interactions, I made an error in the number of pairs.

Wait, the number of pairs between the 12 charges is (12 choose 2) = 66. Correct.

So if each pair contributes e²/(2 π ε₀), then 66 pairs contribute 33 e²/(π ε₀). And the 12 pairs contribute 6 e²/(π ε₀). So total is 39 e²/(π ε₀).

So, 39 * e²/(π ε₀) → which is approximately 39 * 2.566e-38 / (3.1416 *8.854e-12) → let's compute that precisely.

Compute numerator: 39 * 2.566e-38 = 39 * 2.566 = 100.074 → 1.00074e-36.

Denominator: 3.1416 *8.854e-12 ≈ 27.83e-12 → 2.783e-11.

So 1.00074e-36 / 2.783e-11 = (1.00074 / 2.783) )e-25 → approximately 0.3595e-25 = 3.595e-26 J.

Hmm. None of the options match this. But option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 1.57 times higher than 3.595e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me check the value of k: k = 1/(4π ε₀) ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, another approach: compute the total U from the fixed charge to the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges contributes U = (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2 → because r=2 m.

So, U = 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2 ] → 12 * [ (k *4 e²) / 2 ] → 12 * [ 2 k e² ] →24 k e².

Now, let's compute 24 k e².

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 → compute 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988 = approx 215.712 → 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38 → 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) e-27 → approximately 5.54e-27 J.

Again, same as before. So this approach gives 5.54e-27 J, which is option C (7.056e-27 is higher, so not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, not their mutual interactions. So the mutual interactions are ignored, perhaps because the problem says the 12 are 'constrained' to be at 2m from P. But I'm not sure why mutual interactions would be ignored; perhaps it's an oversight in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the mutual distances. Maybe the mutual distances between the 12 charges are all 2m apart. But then, how can 12 charges be arranged on a sphere of radius 2m such that each is 2m apart from every other? That's impossible because the maximum possible distance on a sphere of radius 2m is 4m (diametrically opposite points). So two points on the sphere can't be 2m apart if the radius is 2m. Wait, no: the chord length (straight-line distance between two points on the sphere) is 2 m. So chord length c = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So with r=2 m, c=2 m → 2=2*2 sin(θ/2) → 2=4 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2)=0.5 → θ/2=30 degrees → θ=60 degrees.

So each pair of the 12 charges is separated by 60 degrees on the sphere. But can 12 points be placed on a sphere such that each pair is 60 degrees apart? That's the question of spherical codes. For a regular icosahedron, the angles between adjacent vertices are about 63.43 degrees, so not exactly 60. So perhaps the problem is making a simplifying assumption that all mutual distances are 2m, but in reality, that's not possible for 12 points. So perhaps the mutual interactions are not to be considered, and the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12.

In that case, the total U would be 12 pairs, each contributing (k*(2e)^2)/2 → which is 2 ke² per pair. So 12 * 2 ke² =24 ke².

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 → 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 → 24 * 2.3e-28 → approximately 5.52e-27 J.

Again, which isn't matching any option except perhaps option C if I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I should compute 39 e²/(π ε_0) numerically.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So, 39 * 2.566e-38 = 1.00074e-36.

Divided by π * ε_0 → 3.1416 *8.854e-12 = 2.783e-11.

So U=1.00074e-36 /2.783e-11 = 3.595e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.00074e-36 divided by 2.783e-11.

1.00074e-36 / 2.783e-11 = (1.00074 / 2.783) ) * 1e-25.

1.00074 /2.783 ≈ approx 0.359.

So 0.359e-25 = 3.59e-26.

Hmm, none of the options match this. The options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the number of pairs.

Wait, when the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges interacts only with the fixed charge, and not with each other. So the mutual interactions are ignored. In that case, the total U would be 12 * ( (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) ) / 2.

Which is 12 * (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀) → 12 * e²/(2 π ε₀) → (12/2) e²/(π ε₀) → 6 e²/(π ε₀).

So compute 6 * (1.602e-19)^2 / ( π *8.854e-12 ).

Compute numerator: 6 * (2.566e-38) =15.396e-38 → 1.5396e-37.

Denominator: 3.1416 *8.854e-12 → 2.783e-11.

So U=1.5396e-37 / 2.783e-11 → 5.535e-27 J.

Which is option C: 7.056e-27 is not matching. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are electrons, but no, the charge is 2e, which is positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the potential energy only between the fixed charge and the 12, not including the mutual interactions. So the answer would be 5.53e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of mutual pairs.

Wait, 12 charges, each at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not 2m, so perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, not their mutual interactions. So the mutual interactions are zero, or not considered.

In that case, the calculation is 12 pairs, each with U= e²/(4 π ε_0 * 2) → wait, no.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2) / r.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, so each pair between P and a charge contributes U = (k * 2e * 2e) / 2 m → which is (4 e² k) / (2 * 2) → (4 e² k) /4 → e² k.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute this correctly.

r is 2m. So U = (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2) → (4 e² k) / 2 → 2 e² k.

So each pair contributes 2 e² k. So for 12 pairs, U = 12 * 2 e² k → 24 e² k.

Now, compute 24 e² k.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

So, e² = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 → compute 24 *8.988e9 = 2.157e11, then multiply by 2.566e-38 → 2.157e11 *2.566e-38 = 5.54e-27 J.

Again, same as before. So maybe the correct answer is 5.54e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, but it's not the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e, so their product is (2e)^2 =4 e², and 1/(4π ε_0) * (4e²)/(2 m) → (4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) → e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

Wait, but m is in meters. So, e²/(2 π ε_0 * 2) → e²/(4 π ε_0).

Wait, no, because m=2 meters. So, substituting m=2:

e²/(2 π ε_0 * 2) = e²/(4 π ε_0).

So each pair contributes e²/(4 π ε_0).

So 12 pairs → 12 e²/(4 π ε_0) = 3 e²/(π ε_0).

Compute that: 3 * (1.602e-19)^2 / ( π *8.854e-12 ).

3 * 2.566e-38 =7.698e-38.

Divide by 2.783e-11 →7.698e-38 /2.783e-11 = 2.766e-27 J.

But this doesn't match any option either.

Hmm, I'm stuck. None of the options match the calculations I'm getting. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and not the mutual potential energy among the 12. So the total U is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which is 12 * (4 e² k)/(4 m) → 12 * (e² k)/(m).

Wait, m is 2 meters, so U = 12 * e² k / 2 →6 e² k.

So compute 6 * (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9 / 2 → wait, no, wait:

Wait, U = 12 * [ (k (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ) ] → 12 * [ (4 e² k) / (4 m) ) ] → 12 * [ e² k/(m) ] → 12 e² k / m.

m is 2 meters, so U =6 e² k.

Compute 6 * (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9 → 6 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 → 6 *2.566e-38=1.5396e-37, multiply by 8.988e9 → approx 1.5396e-37 *8.988e9 → 1.385e-27 J.

Hmm, which doesn't match any options either.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the charges are electrons, but the charge is 2e. So perhaps the charge is -2e, but that would make no difference in the potential energy calculation because it's squared.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 charges, but the 12 charges are all at the same point, leading to a different calculation. But that's not physically possible because like charges would repel.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are zero, but that's impossible as they are fixed at 2m from P.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this and perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the calculation that includes all possible interactions. So the total U is 39 e²/(π ε_0) → 3.595e-26 J. Looking at the options, the closest is option A:5.645e-26, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of mutual pairs. Let me compute 39 * e²/(π ε_0) again numerically.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

39 *2.566e-38 = 1.00074e-36.

Divide by π *8.854e-12 → 2.783e-11.

So 1.00074e-36 /2.783e-11 → 3.595e-26 J.

But looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2.822e-26, but I'm not sure how that number is derived.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mutual interactions are not all 2m. For example, the problem might have the 12 charges arranged in a regular dodecahedron, leading to different distances. But without specific information, it's impossible to proceed.

Another approach: perhaps the problem's answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J. Let me compute what factor would make 3.595e-26 into 2.822e-26. It's approximately 0.785, which is 1/(sqrt(2)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps each mutual pair contributes twice the energy. Because in the calculation, each pair is counted once, but perhaps the formula requires each pair to be counted twice. No, that's not correct because in the Σ notation, each pair is only counted once.

I think I've exhausted my options. Perhaps the intended answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy, which is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where one charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \).

### Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. **Potential Energy Contributions**:
   - The total potential energy \( U \) is the sum of contributions from:
     - Interactions between the fixed charge at \( P \) and each of the 12 charges at 2 meters.
     - Interactions between the 12 charges themselves, assuming their mutual distances are also 2 meters (a simplifying assumption).

2. **Fixed Charge and 12 Charges**:
   - Each pair involving the fixed charge contributes:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-12}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2 \, \text{m}}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-12}} = \frac{4e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{e^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0}
     \]
   - There are 12 such pairs, so the total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-12, total}} = 12 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi\epsilon_0}
     \]

3. **Mutual Interactions Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The number of unique pairs among the 12 charges is:
     \[
     \binom{12}{2} = 66
     \]
   - Each pair contributes:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2 \, \text{m}} = \frac{e^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0}
     \]
   - The total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual, total}} = 66 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{33e^2}{\pi\epsilon_0}
     \]

4. **Total Potential Energy**:
   - Adding the contributions:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{fixed-12, total}} + U_{\text{mutual, total}} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi\epsilon_0} + \frac{33e^2}{\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{39e^2}{\pi\epsilon_0}
     \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Substituting constants:
     \[
     e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}, \quad \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}, \quad \pi \approx 3.1416
     \]
     \[
     e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
     \]
   - Compute:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = \frac{39 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{3.1416 \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12}}
     \]
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = \frac{1.00074 \times 10^{-36}}{2.783 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.595 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( 3.595 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - The closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 15% lower than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from assumptions about the mutual distances or rounding differences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **B**, as it is the closest to the calculated value.

Answer: B
