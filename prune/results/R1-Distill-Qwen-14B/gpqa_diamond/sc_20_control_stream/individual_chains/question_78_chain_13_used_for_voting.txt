Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). At some earlier time tr, the charge's velocity was v. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So, I guess d is the displacement between the charge's position at tr and the point r.

The options are various expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. I remember that potentials are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. But wait, when charges are moving, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and retarded times. Oh right, because the fields at a point depend on where the charge was earlier, not where it is now. That makes sense because the influence travels at the speed of light.

So the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, something like V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the point. But wait, in this case, the charge isn't stationary. So maybe we need to consider the retarded position.

Wait, the vector from the charge's position at tr to r is d. So the distance between them is |d|, right? But wait, since d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance is |d|, and the denominator would be based on that. But looking at the options, some have terms like d c minus the dot product of d and v. That looks familiar—maybe it's the relativistic contraction or something related to Lorentz factors.

Wait, let me think about the retarded time. The charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and the observation is at time t, which is after tr. The light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r is (t - tr) = |d|/c. So, tr = t - |d|/c. But how does that affect the potentials?

I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just Coulomb's potential because the charge's velocity affects the fields. Oh wait, but scalar potential is usually straightforward. Maybe the scalar potential still looks similar but with a different expression because of the motion.

Wait, in the case of a moving charge, the scalar potential is calculated using the retarded position. So the scalar potential V at point r and time t is given by (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 over the distance at the retarded time. So the distance would be |d|, but wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So |d| = sqrt( (r - s(tr))² ), which is the same as the distance from the charge to the point at time tr. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor. Looking at the options, options C and D have terms in the denominator that involve (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). Hmm.

Wait, let's get into the vector potential A. The vector potential for a moving charge is usually given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) times (v × r') divided by (r'^2 c²), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think when the charge is moving with velocity v, the vector potential has a term involving v and the displacement.

Wait, in the case of the vector potential, the standard expression is A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v(r') / (c² r') ] where r' is the vector from the charge's position to the point of interest. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B via B = ∇×A. For a moving point charge, the B field is given by Ampère's law, but since the charge is moving, the field at some point depends on the charge's velocity and position at an earlier time.

I think the expression for the vector potential when the charge is moving is given by A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v / (1 - v·r'/(c² r') ) or something along those lines. Or perhaps it's A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (r' )/(r'^2 - (v·r')²/c² )^(1/2) ) or something similar.

Wait, I remember that when you have a moving charge, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity. Let me think about the exact expressions.

The scalar potential V at point r and time t due to a charge q moving with velocity v at time tr is given by:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1 / ( |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 + (v·d̂)/(c) ) ] ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look at the general form. The potentials for a moving charge involve the concept of the retarded time. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (|r - s(tr)|) ) ] * [ 1 / (1 + (v·(r - s(tr)))/(c |r - s(tr)|) ) ]

Wait, that might be the case. Alternatively, in terms of d, which is the vector r - s(tr), so d = r - s(tr). Then the denominator becomes sqrt( (d c)^2 - (d · v)^2 ) or something like that. Let me think about the Lorentz contraction. The denominator in the potentials may involve a term that comes from the Lorentz factor, which might be sqrt( (c² d² - (v·d)^2 ) ) / c².

Wait, another approach: The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, and for a point charge in motion, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

The scalar potential is usually given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t') ] / |r - r'| dt'

But since it's a point charge, ρ is q δ³(r' - s(tr')) δ(t' - tr), so the integral becomes (q/(4πε₀)) / |r - s(tr)|. However, this is the static case. When the charge is moving, the potential might involve a term that accounts for the velocity.

Wait, no, actually, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is still given by Coulomb's law evaluated at the retarded time. So V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So in terms of the options, that would match option B's V, because option B's V is q/(4πε₀ r), but wait, r is the distance from origin to r, not from the charge's position. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, in the problem, the vector d is defined as the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge at tr and the point r.

So, the scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε₀ |d| ). But looking at the options, option B's V is q/(4πε₀ r), which would only be correct if r is the distance from the charge, which it's not. So perhaps the correct expression isn't option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the options express r as the observation point. So perhaps the correct V should involve d, not r. Looking at the options, option C has V with (d c - d·v) in the denominator, and option D has (d c + d·v) in the denominator.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the exact expressions from my notes. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) / (|d|) multiplied by 1/[ (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ]? Or wait, perhaps the denominator is something like sqrt( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ) ) divided by c².

Wait, another approach: The general expression for the scalar potential from a moving charge is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( |d| ) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the Lorentz contraction would modify the distance. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the denominator in the potentials involves the term sqrt( (c d)^2 - (v·d)^2 ). Let me think about the term (c d - v·d)^2.

Wait, considering the expression for the potential, the denominator is |d| multiplied by the square root of (1 - (v²/c²)) or something like that. Alternatively, the denominator could be (c² d² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) / c².

Wait, another way: the potentials are affected by the motion of the charge, which introduces a term related to the velocity. The vector potential A is usually proportional to v and the scalar potential V.

Wait, I remember that the vector potential A can be expressed as ( (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) ) * (d / (|d| (c² |d| - v·d )) )) ? Not exactly sure, but perhaps.

Wait, option C for the vector potential is (μ₀ q c v) / [4π (d c - d·v) ].

Hmm, but let me think about the units. The vector potential A should have units of T·m²/A, which is equivalent to (kg·m²)/(s²·A). Let's see:

Looking at option C's vector potential:

(μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (d c - d·v) ]

μ₀ has units of H/m (kg·m/(s²·A²)), q is Coulombs (A·s), c is m/s, v is m/s. So numerator: μ₀ * q * c * v → (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (A·s) * (m/s) * (m/s) = kg·m/(A² s) * m²/s² → kg·m^3/(A² s^3).

Denominator is (d c - d·v) → m * (m/s) minus (m·m/s² * m/s) → units of m²/s.

So A's units would be (kg·m³/(A² s^3)) ) / (m²/s) ) → kg·m/(A² s²). Which is (kg·m²/(s²·A²)) ) * m/(m^2) → No, wait:

Wait, denominator is (d c - d·v) which has units of [m] * [m/s] → m²/s, because d·v is (m)(m/s) → m²/s.

So denominator is m²/s.

So vector potential numerator is μ₀ q c v → (H/m) (C) (m/s) (m/s) → (H is kg·m/(s²·A²)), so H/m is kg/(s²·A²), times C (A s) → kg/(s A²) * s A = kg/(s A²) * A s → kg/(A). Then times (m/s)² → kg m²/(s^3 A²).

So numerator is kg m²/(s^3 A²).

Denominator is m²/s → so kg m²/(s^3 A²) / (m²/s) ) = kg/(s² A²) → which is equivalent to (kg·m²)/(s²·A²) ) / m² → (kg·m²)/(s²·A²) ) * 1/m² → kg/(s² A²).

Wait, but the unit for A is kg·m/(s²·A), so maybe I messed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard formula. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v × r') / (|r'|² - (v·r')²/c²)^(1/2) ), or something like that, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that when the charge is moving, the potentials have a term that includes the velocity. The vector potential A is proportional to v, and the scalar potential V is the Coulomb potential scaled by some factor.

Looking at the options, option C and D have expressions where V is (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ] and similar for A, which include the velocity.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the expression for the potentials in terms of the fields. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. For a static charge, this would just be the Coulomb field, but when moving, time derivatives of A contribute.

But in the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, the potentials can be written in terms of the position and the velocity. The standard expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r_tr|) * (1/(1 - (v·(r - r_tr))/(c |r - r_tr|)) )

and

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × (r - r_tr)) / (c² |r - r_tr| (1 - (v·(r - r_tr))/(c |r - r_tr|)) )

Wait, but perhaps that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I've seen expressions where the denominator is (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So, in terms of d, the denominator would be sqrt(c² |d|² - (v·d)^2).

So, let me write that.

The scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/(sqrt(c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )) )

Wait, but that's not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ), but in the options, the denominators are terms like (d c - d·v) and similar.

Wait, looking at option C: 

V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - (d · v)) ]

Similarly, the vector potential for option C is [μ₀ q c v ] / [4π (d c - d · v) ]

Wait, but d here is a vector. So perhaps the denominator in option C is d c - d·v, which would be a vector? Because d c is a vector (d multiplied by c scalar), and d·v is scalar. So d c - (d·v) doesn't make sense dimensionally because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps that's a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c d - (v × d)) or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dot product. Let me think: The denominator in option C is (d c - (d · v)).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because d is a vector, d c is a vector scaled by c, and d·v is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector is impossible. So perhaps the options have a typo. Or perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Wait, that's possible. Because if d is a vector, |d| is its magnitude. So perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Looking back at the options:

Option C: denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps it's a typo, and the correct denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Hmm, but perhaps another approach. Let me think about the expression for the potentials in terms of the velocity.

The vector potential A is typically given by:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * [ v / (1 - (v·d̂)/(c) ) ] * (d̂)/(1 - (v·d̂)/(c) )

Wait, that's perhaps not correct. Alternatively, I think the expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) multiplied by (d ) / (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Because the denominator would involve the relativistic contraction factor. So, the denominator would be (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2).

So, if I write V as q/(4πε₀) * 1/(sqrt( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ) / c^4 )) )

Wait, because the denominator in the potentials would be the contracted distance. Let me compute that.

The Lorentz-contraction factor is sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ), but in the context of the fields, the distance in the direction of motion is contracted.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in V is ( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) ) / c².

So V = (q/(4πε₀)) * c² / ( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) )

Which simplifies to (q c²)/(4πε₀ sqrt(c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ) )

But looking at the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v) )

Wait, but (d c - d · v ) is a vector minus a scalar, which can't be correct. So perhaps the denominator in option C is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's (d c - (d · v)) which is dimensionally inconsistent. So perhaps the denominator should be (c² |d| - d · v ), but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c^2 |d| - (d · v) ) / c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute the denominator for V. We have (c² |d|² - (v · d)^2 )^(1/2). Let's factor out c² |d|²:

= c |d| sqrt( 1 - ( (v ·d)^2 )/(c² |d|^2) )

= c |d| sqrt(1 - (v · d̂ )² / c² ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Let's think about the options. Option C and D have different denominators involving d c and d · v.

Wait, another approach: The potentials can be expressed using the Liénard potentials. Let me recall those.

The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) ∫ [ δ(t - t_r - |r - s(tr)|/c ) ] / |r - s(tr)| d^3 r'

But that's complicated. Alternatively, the scalar potential can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/( |d| ) ] [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

Wait, that makes sense because the denominator includes the factor for the motion. So V = q/(4πε₀) * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) )

Similarly, the vector potential A would be:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) [ v/(c²) ] / (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) )

But how does this relate to the options given?

Wait, option B says V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) V. That would be the case if d = r, but that's not correct because d is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point.

Wait, but perhaps when the charge is moving, the potentials are still given in terms of the distance from the charge, scaled by a factor involving the velocity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the speed. The denominator in V could involve (c² d² - (v·d)^2 ), and the numerator would involve q or μ₀ q.

Looking again at the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)) and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

But as before, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which has a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct denominator is something else.

Wait, perhaps option C is written incorrectly, and the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)/c ). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as the terms in the options. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let me think about the potentials in terms of the expression for the electromagnetic fields. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to both the electric and magnetic fields.

The electric field E is given by E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The magnetic field B is ∇×A. For a charge moving with velocity v, the electric and magnetic fields should account for the motion, which would come from the potentials.

In the Coulomb gauge, things might be simpler, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the potentials for a simple case. Let's consider the case where the charge is moving along the x-axis, and the observation point is along the x-axis. So v is in the x direction, and d is along x as well.

In this case, d = (d_x, 0, 0), and v = (v_x, 0, 0).

Then the denominator for V would be c² d_x² - (v · d)^2 → c² d_x² - v_x² d_x² = d_x² (c² - v_x² )

So sqrt( c² d_x² - (v·d)^2 ) = d_x sqrt(c² - v_x² )

So V would be q/(4πε₀) * 1/( d_x sqrt(1 - v_x²/c²) ) )

Which can be written as [ q c ] / (4πε₀ d_x (c² - v_x² )^(1/2) )) )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in V is (c² |d|² - (v · d)^2 )^(1/2). So V = q/(4πε₀) * c / sqrt(c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )

Which would make V = (q c)/(4πε₀ sqrt( c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )) )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option C has V as (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ]. So the denominator in option C is d c - d·v. But with d being a vector, that's not correct. So perhaps the correct denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

Wait, but in the case where d is along v, |d|=d (since d is positive in that direction), and d · v = d v cosθ. If d and v are in the same direction, cosθ=1, so d·v = d v.

So, the denominator in option C would be (d c - d v ), which is d(c - v). But that's not the same as the c² |d| - (d · v) ) term I was considering.

So perhaps option C is incorrect because of the denominator structure, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v) ), but considering that d is a vector, perhaps the expression is (d × (c - (v · d̂) )) or something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: V is Coulomb's law, A is v²/c² times V. That would imply A is proportional to velocity squared, which doesn't make sense because A should be proportional to velocity. So probably A is incorrect.

Option B: V is Coulomb's law, A is (v/c²) V. So A would be proportional to velocity, which makes sense. But the problem with option B is that V is still using r (the position vector) as the distance, which should instead be |d|. So perhaps B is wrong.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v) ). So in this case, denominator is (d c - d · v), which is a vector operation, but I think that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( c² |d| - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as what's written.

Option D: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c + d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + d · v) ). So denominator is (d c + d · v), again which is vector plus scalar, which can't be right. So perhaps the correct option is not D.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in V and A is (c² |d| - (d · v) ). Let's compute that.

c² |d|² - (d · v )² is the denominator in the sqrt for V. So perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (c |d| - (d · v)/c ), but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which would have units of m²/s².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the general form of the potentials.

The standard expressions for V and A due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1 / ( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c) ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v × d̂) / (c² (1 - (v·d̂)/c) ) ]

But with d̂ being the unit vector in the direction of d, which is (r - s(tr)).

Wait, but that doesn't directly match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

Wait, let me consider the denominator in V. Since (v · d) is the projection of v onto d, perhaps the denominator involves (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So, V = (q c) / (4πε₀ (c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

But none of the options match this exactly. Let's look at option C: V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c - (d · v) ) )

Wait, if d is a vector, then (d c - (d · v)) is a vector minus a scalar, which is invalid. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C is incorrect in this respect.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which would have the same units as c² |d|, which is m²/s².

Wait, but the denominator in option C is written as (d c - d · v ), which would have units of (m/s) * m (if d is in m) minus (m^2/s^2), so it's mixing units, which can't be correct. So perhaps option C is incorrect, and the correct denominator should be something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the options are written. Let me look again.

The options are:

Option C) V( r, t) = qc/(4 π ε₀ (d c − d · v)), A = μ₀ q c v/(4 π (d c − d · v))

Option D) V = qc/(4 π ε₀ (d c + d · v)), A = μ₀ q c v/(4 π (d c + d · v))

But as I thought, the denominator in option C would be (d c − d · v), which is a vector times a scalar minus a scalar. That can't be correct. So perhaps the options are assuming that d is a scalar, which is not the case. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, it's (d × c) - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as (d c - d · v ). Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c d - (d · v) ), but d is a vector. So perhaps it's written incorrectly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the denominator in terms of the inner product. So perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

In that case, perhaps option C's denominator is written as (d c - (d · v) ), which is not the same as (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about the correct expressions for V and A.

Wait, I think the correct scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [ 1/( 1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/(c |r - s(tr)|) ) ]

Which can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ c ] / [ c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ]^(1/2 )

So V(r, t) = (q c)/(4πε₀ sqrt( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )) )

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) [ (v × d ) / ( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )^(1/2) ) ]

Which can be written as:

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ d × (1/( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )^(1/2) )) ]

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match these expressions.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (d c - (d · v) ), which would be (c |d| - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as c² |d|² - (d · v )^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator for V. Let me see.

The denominator in V is sqrt( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 ), which is sqrt( (c |d| )² - (v ·d )^2 )

So if I factor out c², it becomes c sqrt( |d|² - (v ·d )² / c² )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be written as (c² |d| - (v ·d )) ) but that's not correct because (v ·d ) is in units of m²/s² and c² |d| is m²/s², so their difference would be in m²/s².

Wait, but then the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v ), which would have units of (m/s * m) - (m^2/s^2 ), which is not the same as m²/s². So that can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something about the way the options are written. Perhaps in the options, d is the magnitude of the vector d, so d represents |d|.

Wait, that would make sense. Let me assume that in the options, d is the magnitude of the vector d, so the denominator is (d c - (d · v) )

Wait, but that would imply that d is a scalar (the magnitude of the vector d), and (d · v) is the scalar product of the vector d and v. So (d · v) would be |d| |v| cosθ, where θ is the angle between them.

So, the denominator in option C would be [ d c - (d |v| cosθ ) ]

Which is d (c - |v| cosθ )

Then, V would be (q c) / [4πε₀ d (c - |v| cosθ) ]

And A would be (μ₀ q c v) / [4π d (c - |v| cosθ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the denominator could be ( c^2 d^2 - (v · d)^2 )^(1/2 ), which would be sqrt( c^2 d^2 - (v d cosθ)^2 ), which becomes d sqrt( c^2 - (v^2 cos^2θ) )

So V would be (q c) / [4πε₀ d sqrt(c² - v² cos²θ) ]

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C if we assume that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), and that the expressions are written assuming d is the magnitude.

Wait, but then the denominator in option C would be (d c - (d · v) ), which is d (c - (v cosθ) ), where θ is the angle between d and v.

So, V = (q c) / [4πε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ]

Which would be (q c)/(4πε₀ d (c - v cosθ) )

That seems plausible. So, for option C, V is this expression, and A is (μ₀ q c v) / [4π d (c - v cosθ) ]

Wait, but when I look at the standard expression for A, it's usually (μ₀ q v ) / (4π c²) * (d̂ ) / (1 - (v·d̂)/c )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are found in option C, and the denominator in V is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So, perhaps I should pick option C, even though the denominator is written in a confusing way.

Wait, but option C's denominator is (d c - d · v ), which as I said, if d is a vector, is incorrect. But if d is the magnitude (|d| ), then it's (|d| c - (d · v) ), which would have units of m/s * m minus m^2/s^2. That's not correct either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since I'm stuck, maybe I can think about the relationship between V and A.

In the options, option C has A as (mu_0 q c v ) / [4 pi (denominator) ]

If I can relate A to V, perhaps I'll find which option is correct.

In the case of a steady charge, A is proportional to the velocity. So, looking at the options, option C has A proportional to v, which makes sense.

But in terms of the potentials, I think the correct expressions have A proportional to (v × d) / (c² |d| ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, as it's the only one where both V and A have the correct scaling with c and v.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that option C is correct.

V = (q c ) / [4π ε₀ (d c - (d · v) ) ]

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - (d · v) ) ]

Then, checking the units:

For V: [q] is Coulombs (C), [c] is m/s, [d] is meters. So denominator is (m/s * m ) - (m^2/s^2 ), which is (m²/s - m²/s² ) → which doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps option C is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which would have units of (m²/s² - m²/s² ), which is correct. So if the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), then the units would be correct.

But looking at the options, none of them have this expression. So perhaps the correct option is C, despite the way it's written.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which would give units of m/s * m → m²/s, and (d · v) is m²/s². So that's inconsistent.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the denominator in the options is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), and the options just have a typo in the way they present d.

If that's the case, then option C would have:

V = (q c ) / [4π ε₀ (c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Which would have correct units, as the denominator is in m²/s².

Similarly, the vector potential in option C is (mu_0 q c v ) / [4 pi (c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Which would have correct units:

mu_0 has units H/m (kg·m/(s²·A²)), q is C (A s), c is m/s, v is m/s.

So numerator: kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s * m/s * m/s → kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s → kg·m/(s A ) * m/s² → kg·m²/(s^3 A )

Denominator is (m²/s² )

So A would have units (kg·m²/(s^3 A )) ) / (m²/s² ) → kg/(s A ), which is T·m (since T is kg/(s² A) ), so kg/(s A) → T·m²? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the units for A are (kg·m)/(s²·A ), which is Weber/(m²), but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the correct expressions for the potentials.

I think the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [ (v × d̂ ) / ( c² (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) ]

But if I multiply numerator and denominator by |d|, I get:

V = (q c )/(4πε₀) * [1/( c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) ]

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) * [ (v × d ) / ( c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

V = (q c )/(4πε₀ (c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) )

A = (μ₀ q v (v × d ) ) / (4 π c² (c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) )

Wait, but none of the options seem to match this exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, assuming that the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), but written as (d c - d · v ) in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider when the charge isn't moving, v =0. Then the potentials should reduce to the static case.

In the static case, V should be q/(4πε₀ |d| ), and A should be zero.

Looking at the options:

Option B: V = q/(4πε₀ r ), A = (v/c²) V. If v=0, then A=0, which is correct. But the problem is that V is 1/r, not 1/|d|.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v ) ). If v=0, denominator becomes d c, so V = (q c )/(4πε₀ d c ) )= q/(4πε₀ d ), which is correct. So when v=0, option C reduces to the static case correctly.

Similarly, for A in option C: When v=0, the numerator becomes zero, so A=0, which is correct.

So option C seems to handle the static case correctly. So that's a good sign.

Option D: When v=0, V becomes (q c )/(4 π ε₀ (d c) ), which is q/(4π ε₀ d ), which is correct, and A would be zero when v=0. But for the denominator, (d c + d ·v ), when v=0, it's d c, so same as option C in that case.

So both C and D handle the static case correctly. So that doesn't help.

Hmm, but when the charge is moving, the potentials should account for the motion.

Wait, another test: Consider when the charge is moving directly away from the observation point, i.e., d and v are in the same direction. So θ=0, cosθ=1.

Then, in option C, denominator becomes (d c - d v ) = d (c - v )

So V = (q c )/(4 π ε₀ d (c - v) )

Which can be rewritten as V = [ q/(4 π ε₀ d) ] * [ c/(c - v) ]

But in this case, the charge is moving away, so the effective distance would increase. So the potential should decrease, which is what happens here because c/(c -v) is greater than 1 when v is positive.

Similarly, for option C, the vector potential would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π d (c - v) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, if the charge is moving towards the observation point, v is positive in the same direction as d. Then, (c - v) would be smaller, making V larger, which makes sense because the charge is approaching, increasing the field.

So option C seems plausible.

But I'm not entirely confident. Hmm.

Another approach: The potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. So, ∇×A should give the magnetic field, and -∇V - ∂A/∂t should give the electric field.

But perhaps that's too involved for this step.

Alternatively, I'll think about the given options and which one correctly includes the velocity dependence.

Option C has A proportional to v, which makes sense. Option B has A proportional to v, but V is static.

Option C's denominator is (d c - d ·v ), which, when v is parallel to d, becomes d (c - v). That makes sense, as the denominator becomes smaller when v approaches c, which is correct because of the Lorentz factor.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The observation point is \( \vec{r} \), and \( \vec{d} \) is the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to \( \vec{r} \). The goal is to analyze the given options and identify the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \)
   - The scalar potential \( V \) is given by Coulomb's law, but it incorrectly uses \( r \) (the distance from the origin) instead of \( |\vec{d}| \) (the distance from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to \( \vec{r} \)). Additionally, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v^2} \), which is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \). **Option A is incorrect.**

2. **Option B**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \)
   - The scalar potential \( V \) again incorrectly uses \( r \) instead of \( |\vec{d}| \). While the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \), the static form of \( V \) makes this option inconsistent with the motion of the charge. **Option B is incorrect.**

3. **Option C**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - The denominator \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) is problematic because \( d \) is a scalar (the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \)), and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is a scalar. This leads to a dimensionally inconsistent expression. However, if \( d \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \), the denominator becomes \( (c |\vec{d}| - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})) \), which is dimensionally consistent. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) both have the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \) and \( |\vec{d}| \), and they reduce to the static case (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)) correctly. **Option C is plausible.**

4. **Option D**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - Similar to Option C, the denominator \( (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) is dimensionally inconsistent because \( d \) is a scalar, and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is a scalar. If \( d \) is interpreted as \( |\vec{d}| \), the denominator becomes \( (c |\vec{d}| + (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})) \), which does not align with the expected relativistic corrections to the potentials. Additionally, the plus sign in the denominator is inconsistent with the expected subtraction of the velocity term. **Option D is incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most consistent with the expected forms of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge. While the denominator in Option C is written ambiguously, interpreting \( d \) as \( |\vec{d}| \) makes it dimensionally consistent and correctly incorporates the velocity dependence. The static case (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)) also reduces correctly to Coulomb's law for \( V \) and zero for \( \vec{A} \).

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). At some earlier time tr, the charge's velocity was v. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So, I guess d is the displacement between the charge's position at tr and the point r.

The options are various expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. I remember that potentials are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. But wait, when charges are moving, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and retarded times. Oh right, because the fields at a point depend on where the charge was earlier, not where it is now. That makes sense because the influence travels at the speed of light.

So the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, something like V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the point. But wait, in this case, the charge isn't stationary. So maybe we need to consider the retarded position.

Wait, the vector from the charge's position at tr to r is d. So the distance between them is |d|, right? But wait, since d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance is |d|, and the denominator would be based on that. But looking at the options, some have terms like d c minus the dot product of d and v. That looks familiar—maybe it's the relativistic contraction or something related to Lorentz factors.

Wait, let me think about the retarded time. The charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and the observation is at time t, which is after tr. The light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r is (t - tr) = |d|/c. So, tr = t - |d|/c. But how does that affect the potentials?

I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just Coulomb's potential because the charge's velocity affects the fields. Oh wait, but scalar potential is usually straightforward. Maybe the scalar potential still looks similar but with a different expression because of the motion.

Wait, in the case of a moving charge, the scalar potential is calculated using the retarded position. So the scalar potential V at point r and time t is given by (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 over the distance at the retarded time. So the distance would be |d|, but wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So |d| = sqrt( (r - s(tr))² ), which is the same as the distance from the charge to the point at time tr. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor. Looking at the options, options C and D have terms in the denominator that involve (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). Hmm.

Wait, let's get into the vector potential A. The vector potential for a moving charge is usually given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) times (v × r') divided by (r'^2 c²), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think when the charge is moving with velocity v, the vector potential has a term involving v and the displacement.

Wait, in the case of the vector potential, the standard expression is A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v(r') / (c² r') ] where r' is the vector from the charge's position to the point of interest. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B via B = ∇×A. For a moving point charge, the B field is given by Ampère's law, but since the charge is moving, the field at some point depends on the charge's velocity and position at an earlier time.

I think the expression for the vector potential when the charge is moving is given by A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v / (1 - v·r'/(c² r') ) or something along those lines. Or perhaps it's A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (r' )/(r'^2 - (v·r')²/c² )^(1/2) ) or something similar.

Wait, I remember that when you have a moving charge, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity. Let me think about the exact expressions.

The scalar potential V at point r and time t due to a charge q moving with velocity v at time tr is given by:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1 / ( |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 + (v·d̂)/(c) ) ] ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look at the general form. The potentials for a moving charge involve the concept of the retarded time. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (|r - s(tr)|) ) ] * [ 1 / (1 + (v·(r - s(tr)))/(c |r - s(tr)|) ) ]

Wait, that might be the case. Alternatively, in terms of d, which is the vector r - s(tr), so d = r - s(tr). Then the denominator becomes sqrt( (d c)^2 - (d · v)^2 ) or something like that. Let me think about the Lorentz contraction. The denominator in the potentials may involve a term that comes from the Lorentz factor, which might be sqrt( (c² d² - (v·d)^2 ) ) / c².

Wait, another approach: The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, and for a point charge in motion, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

The scalar potential is usually given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t') ] / |r - r'| dt'

But since it's a point charge, ρ is q δ³(r' - s(tr')) δ(t' - tr), so the integral becomes (q/(4πε₀)) / |r - s(tr)|. However, this is the static case. When the charge is moving, the potential might involve a term that accounts for the velocity.

Wait, no, actually, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is still given by Coulomb's law evaluated at the retarded time. So V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So in terms of the options, that would match option B's V, because option B's V is q/(4πε₀ r), but wait, r is the distance from origin to r, not from the charge's position. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, in the problem, the vector d is defined as the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge at tr and the point r.

So, the scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε₀ |d| ). But looking at the options, option B's V is q/(4πε₀ r), which would only be correct if r is the distance from the charge, which it's not. So perhaps the correct expression isn't option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the options express r as the observation point. So perhaps the correct V should involve d, not r. Looking at the options, option C has V with (d c - d·v) in the denominator, and option D has (d c + d·v) in the denominator.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the exact expressions from my notes. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) / (|d|) multiplied by 1/[ (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ]? Or wait, perhaps the denominator is something like sqrt( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ) ) divided by c².

Wait, another approach: The general expression for the scalar potential from a moving charge is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( |d| ) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the Lorentz contraction would modify the distance. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the denominator in the potentials involves the term sqrt( (c d)^2 - (v·d)^2 ). Let me think about the term (c d - v·d)^2.

Wait, considering the expression for the potential, the denominator is |d| multiplied by the square root of (1 - (v²/c²)) or something like that. Alternatively, the denominator could be (c² d² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) / c².

Wait, another way: the potentials are affected by the motion of the charge, which introduces a term related to the velocity. The vector potential A is usually proportional to v and the scalar potential V.

Wait, I remember that the vector potential A can be expressed as ( (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) ) * (d / (|d| (c² |d| - v·d )) )) ? Not exactly sure, but perhaps.

Wait, option C for the vector potential is (μ₀ q c v) / [4π (d c - d·v) ].

Hmm, but let me think about the units. The vector potential A should have units of T·m²/A, which is equivalent to (kg·m²)/(s²·A). Let's see:

Looking at option C's vector potential:

(μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (d c - d·v) ]

μ₀ has units of H/m (kg·m/(s²·A²)), q is Coulombs (A·s), c is m/s, v is m/s. So numerator: μ₀ * q * c * v → (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (A·s) * (m/s) * (m/s) = kg·m/(A² s) * m²/s² → kg·m^3/(A² s^3).

Denominator is (d c - d·v) → m * (m/s) minus (m·m/s² * m/s) → units of m²/s.

So A's units would be (kg·m³/(A² s^3)) ) / (m²/s) ) → kg·m/(A² s²). Which is (kg·m²/(s²·A²)) ) * m/(m^2) → No, wait:

Wait, denominator is (d c - d·v) which has units of [m] * [m/s] → m²/s, because d·v is (m)(m/s) → m²/s.

So denominator is m²/s.

So vector potential numerator is μ₀ q c v → (H/m) (C) (m/s) (m/s) → (H is kg·m/(s²·A²)), so H/m is kg/(s²·A²), times C (A s) → kg/(s A²) * s A = kg/(s A²) * A s → kg/(A). Then times (m/s)² → kg m²/(s^3 A²).

So numerator is kg m²/(s^3 A²).

Denominator is m²/s → so kg m²/(s^3 A²) / (m²/s) ) = kg/(s² A²) → which is equivalent to (kg·m²)/(s²·A²) ) / m² → (kg·m²)/(s²·A²) ) * 1/m² → kg/(s² A²).

Wait, but the unit for A is kg·m/(s²·A), so maybe I messed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard formula. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v × r') / (|r'|² - (v·r')²/c²)^(1/2) ), or something like that, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that when the charge is moving, the potentials have a term that includes the velocity. The vector potential A is proportional to v, and the scalar potential V is the Coulomb potential scaled by some factor.

Looking at the options, option C and D have expressions where V is (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ] and similar for A, which include the velocity.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the expression for the potentials in terms of the fields. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. For a static charge, this would just be the Coulomb field, but when moving, time derivatives of A contribute.

But in the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, the potentials can be written in terms of the position and the velocity. The standard expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r_tr|) * (1/(1 - (v·(r - r_tr))/(c |r - r_tr|)) )

and

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × (r - r_tr)) / (c² |r - r_tr| (1 - (v·(r - r_tr))/(c |r - r_tr|)) )

Wait, but perhaps that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I've seen expressions where the denominator is (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So, in terms of d, the denominator would be sqrt(c² |d|² - (v·d)^2).

So, let me write that.

The scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/(sqrt(c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )) )

Wait, but that's not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ), but in the options, the denominators are terms like (d c - d·v) and similar.

Wait, looking at option C: 

V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - (d · v)) ]

Similarly, the vector potential for option C is [μ₀ q c v ] / [4π (d c - d · v) ]

Wait, but d here is a vector. So perhaps the denominator in option C is d c - d·v, which would be a vector? Because d c is a vector (d multiplied by c scalar), and d·v is scalar. So d c - (d·v) doesn't make sense dimensionally because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps that's a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c d - (v × d)) or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dot product. Let me think: The denominator in option C is (d c - (d · v)).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because d is a vector, d c is a vector scaled by c, and d·v is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector is impossible. So perhaps the options have a typo. Or perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Wait, that's possible. Because if d is a vector, |d| is its magnitude. So perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Looking back at the options:

Option C: denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps it's a typo, and the correct denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Hmm, but perhaps another approach. Let me think about the expression for the potentials in terms of the velocity.

The vector potential A is typically given by:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * [ v / (1 - (v·d̂)/(c) ) ] * (d̂)/(1 - (v·d̂)/(c) )

Wait, that's perhaps not correct. Alternatively, I think the expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) multiplied by (d ) / (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Because the denominator would involve the relativistic contraction factor. So, the denominator would be (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2).

So, if I write V as q/(4πε₀) * 1/(sqrt( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ) / c^4 )) )

Wait, because the denominator in the potentials would be the contracted distance. Let me compute that.

The Lorentz-contraction factor is sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ), but in the context of the fields, the distance in the direction of motion is contracted.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in V is ( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) ) / c².

So V = (q/(4πε₀)) * c² / ( (c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )^(1/2) )

Which simplifies to (q c²)/(4πε₀ sqrt(c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 ) )

But looking at the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v) )

Wait, but (d c - d · v ) is a vector minus a scalar, which can't be correct. So perhaps the denominator in option C is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's (d c - (d · v)) which is dimensionally inconsistent. So perhaps the denominator should be (c² |d| - d · v ), but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c^2 |d| - (d · v) ) / c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute the denominator for V. We have (c² |d|² - (v · d)^2 )^(1/2). Let's factor out c² |d|²:

= c |d| sqrt( 1 - ( (v ·d)^2 )/(c² |d|^2) )

= c |d| sqrt(1 - (v · d̂ )² / c² ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Let's think about the options. Option C and D have different denominators involving d c and d · v.

Wait, another approach: The potentials can be expressed using the Liénard potentials. Let me recall those.

The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) ∫ [ δ(t - t_r - |r - s(tr)|/c ) ] / |r - s(tr)| d^3 r'

But that's complicated. Alternatively, the scalar potential can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) [ 1/( |d| ) ] [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

Wait, that makes sense because the denominator includes the factor for the motion. So V = q/(4πε₀) * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) )

Similarly, the vector potential A would be:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) [ v/(c²) ] / (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) )

But how does this relate to the options given?

Wait, option B says V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) V. That would be the case if d = r, but that's not correct because d is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point.

Wait, but perhaps when the charge is moving, the potentials are still given in terms of the distance from the charge, scaled by a factor involving the velocity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the speed. The denominator in V could involve (c² d² - (v·d)^2 ), and the numerator would involve q or μ₀ q.

Looking again at the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)) and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

But as before, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which has a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct denominator is something else.

Wait, perhaps option C is written incorrectly, and the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v)).

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)/c ). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as the terms in the options. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let me think about the potentials in terms of the expression for the electromagnetic fields. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to both the electric and magnetic fields.

The electric field E is given by E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The magnetic field B is ∇×A. For a charge moving with velocity v, the electric and magnetic fields should account for the motion, which would come from the potentials.

In the Coulomb gauge, things might be simpler, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the potentials for a simple case. Let's consider the case where the charge is moving along the x-axis, and the observation point is along the x-axis. So v is in the x direction, and d is along x as well.

In this case, d = (d_x, 0, 0), and v = (v_x, 0, 0).

Then the denominator for V would be c² d_x² - (v · d)^2 → c² d_x² - v_x² d_x² = d_x² (c² - v_x² )

So sqrt( c² d_x² - (v·d)^2 ) = d_x sqrt(c² - v_x² )

So V would be q/(4πε₀) * 1/( d_x sqrt(1 - v_x²/c²) ) )

Which can be written as [ q c ] / (4πε₀ d_x (c² - v_x² )^(1/2) )) )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in V is (c² |d|² - (v · d)^2 )^(1/2). So V = q/(4πε₀) * c / sqrt(c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )

Which would make V = (q c)/(4πε₀ sqrt( c² |d|² - (v·d)^2 )) )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option C has V as (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ]. So the denominator in option C is d c - d·v. But with d being a vector, that's not correct. So perhaps the correct denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

Wait, but in the case where d is along v, |d|=d (since d is positive in that direction), and d · v = d v cosθ. If d and v are in the same direction, cosθ=1, so d·v = d v.

So, the denominator in option C would be (d c - d v ), which is d(c - v). But that's not the same as the c² |d| - (d · v) ) term I was considering.

So perhaps option C is incorrect because of the denominator structure, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v) ), but considering that d is a vector, perhaps the expression is (d × (c - (v · d̂) )) or something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: V is Coulomb's law, A is v²/c² times V. That would imply A is proportional to velocity squared, which doesn't make sense because A should be proportional to velocity. So probably A is incorrect.

Option B: V is Coulomb's law, A is (v/c²) V. So A would be proportional to velocity, which makes sense. But the problem with option B is that V is still using r (the position vector) as the distance, which should instead be |d|. So perhaps B is wrong.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v) ). So in this case, denominator is (d c - d · v), which is a vector operation, but I think that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( c² |d| - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as what's written.

Option D: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c + d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + d · v) ). So denominator is (d c + d · v), again which is vector plus scalar, which can't be right. So perhaps the correct option is not D.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in V and A is (c² |d| - (d · v) ). Let's compute that.

c² |d|² - (d · v )² is the denominator in the sqrt for V. So perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (c |d| - (d · v)/c ), but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which would have units of m²/s².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the general form of the potentials.

The standard expressions for V and A due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1 / ( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c) ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v × d̂) / (c² (1 - (v·d̂)/c) ) ]

But with d̂ being the unit vector in the direction of d, which is (r - s(tr)).

Wait, but that doesn't directly match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

Wait, let me consider the denominator in V. Since (v · d) is the projection of v onto d, perhaps the denominator involves (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So, V = (q c) / (4πε₀ (c² |d| - (d · v) ) )

But none of the options match this exactly. Let's look at option C: V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c - (d · v) ) )

Wait, if d is a vector, then (d c - (d · v)) is a vector minus a scalar, which is invalid. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C is incorrect in this respect.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which would have the same units as c² |d|, which is m²/s².

Wait, but the denominator in option C is written as (d c - d · v ), which would have units of (m/s) * m (if d is in m) minus (m^2/s^2), so it's mixing units, which can't be correct. So perhaps option C is incorrect, and the correct denominator should be something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the options are written. Let me look again.

The options are:

Option C) V( r, t) = qc/(4 π ε₀ (d c − d · v)), A = μ₀ q c v/(4 π (d c − d · v))

Option D) V = qc/(4 π ε₀ (d c + d · v)), A = μ₀ q c v/(4 π (d c + d · v))

But as I thought, the denominator in option C would be (d c − d · v), which is a vector times a scalar minus a scalar. That can't be correct. So perhaps the options are assuming that d is a scalar, which is not the case. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, it's (d × c) - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as (d c - d · v ). Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c d - (d · v) ), but d is a vector. So perhaps it's written incorrectly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the denominator in terms of the inner product. So perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

In that case, perhaps option C's denominator is written as (d c - (d · v) ), which is not the same as (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about the correct expressions for V and A.

Wait, I think the correct scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [ 1/( 1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/(c |r - s(tr)|) ) ]

Which can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ c ] / [ c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ]^(1/2 )

So V(r, t) = (q c)/(4πε₀ sqrt( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )) )

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) [ (v × d ) / ( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )^(1/2) ) ]

Which can be written as:

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ d × (1/( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 )^(1/2) )) ]

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match these expressions.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (d c - (d · v) ), which would be (c |d| - (d · v) ), but that's not the same as c² |d|² - (d · v )^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator for V. Let me see.

The denominator in V is sqrt( c² |d|² - (v ·d )^2 ), which is sqrt( (c |d| )² - (v ·d )^2 )

So if I factor out c², it becomes c sqrt( |d|² - (v ·d )² / c² )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be written as (c² |d| - (v ·d )) ) but that's not correct because (v ·d ) is in units of m²/s² and c² |d| is m²/s², so their difference would be in m²/s².

Wait, but then the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v ), which would have units of (m/s * m) - (m^2/s^2 ), which is not the same as m²/s². So that can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something about the way the options are written. Perhaps in the options, d is the magnitude of the vector d, so d represents |d|.

Wait, that would make sense. Let me assume that in the options, d is the magnitude of the vector d, so the denominator is (d c - (d · v) )

Wait, but that would imply that d is a scalar (the magnitude of the vector d), and (d · v) is the scalar product of the vector d and v. So (d · v) would be |d| |v| cosθ, where θ is the angle between them.

So, the denominator in option C would be [ d c - (d |v| cosθ ) ]

Which is d (c - |v| cosθ )

Then, V would be (q c) / [4πε₀ d (c - |v| cosθ) ]

And A would be (μ₀ q c v) / [4π d (c - |v| cosθ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the denominator could be ( c^2 d^2 - (v · d)^2 )^(1/2 ), which would be sqrt( c^2 d^2 - (v d cosθ)^2 ), which becomes d sqrt( c^2 - (v^2 cos^2θ) )

So V would be (q c) / [4πε₀ d sqrt(c² - v² cos²θ) ]

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C if we assume that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), and that the expressions are written assuming d is the magnitude.

Wait, but then the denominator in option C would be (d c - (d · v) ), which is d (c - (v cosθ) ), where θ is the angle between d and v.

So, V = (q c) / [4πε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ]

Which would be (q c)/(4πε₀ d (c - v cosθ) )

That seems plausible. So, for option C, V is this expression, and A is (μ₀ q c v) / [4π d (c - v cosθ) ]

Wait, but when I look at the standard expression for A, it's usually (μ₀ q v ) / (4π c²) * (d̂ ) / (1 - (v·d̂)/c )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are found in option C, and the denominator in V is (c² |d| - (d · v) )

So, perhaps I should pick option C, even though the denominator is written in a confusing way.

Wait, but option C's denominator is (d c - d · v ), which as I said, if d is a vector, is incorrect. But if d is the magnitude (|d| ), then it's (|d| c - (d · v) ), which would have units of m/s * m minus m^2/s^2. That's not correct either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since I'm stuck, maybe I can think about the relationship between V and A.

In the options, option C has A as (mu_0 q c v ) / [4 pi (denominator) ]

If I can relate A to V, perhaps I'll find which option is correct.

In the case of a steady charge, A is proportional to the velocity. So, looking at the options, option C has A proportional to v, which makes sense.

But in terms of the potentials, I think the correct expressions have A proportional to (v × d) / (c² |d| ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, as it's the only one where both V and A have the correct scaling with c and v.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that option C is correct.

V = (q c ) / [4π ε₀ (d c - (d · v) ) ]

A = (μ₀ q c v ) / [4π (d c - (d · v) ) ]

Then, checking the units:

For V: [q] is Coulombs (C), [c] is m/s, [d] is meters. So denominator is (m/s * m ) - (m^2/s^2 ), which is (m²/s - m²/s² ) → which doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps option C is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), which would have units of (m²/s² - m²/s² ), which is correct. So if the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), then the units would be correct.

But looking at the options, none of them have this expression. So perhaps the correct option is C, despite the way it's written.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which would give units of m/s * m → m²/s, and (d · v) is m²/s². So that's inconsistent.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the denominator in the options is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), and the options just have a typo in the way they present d.

If that's the case, then option C would have:

V = (q c ) / [4π ε₀ (c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Which would have correct units, as the denominator is in m²/s².

Similarly, the vector potential in option C is (mu_0 q c v ) / [4 pi (c² |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Which would have correct units:

mu_0 has units H/m (kg·m/(s²·A²)), q is C (A s), c is m/s, v is m/s.

So numerator: kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s * m/s * m/s → kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s → kg·m/(s A ) * m/s² → kg·m²/(s^3 A )

Denominator is (m²/s² )

So A would have units (kg·m²/(s^3 A )) ) / (m²/s² ) → kg/(s A ), which is T·m (since T is kg/(s² A) ), so kg/(s A) → T·m²? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the units for A are (kg·m)/(s²·A ), which is Weber/(m²), but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the correct expressions for the potentials.

I think the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [ (v × d̂ ) / ( c² (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) ]

But if I multiply numerator and denominator by |d|, I get:

V = (q c )/(4πε₀) * [1/( c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) ]

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) * [ (v × d ) / ( c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

V = (q c )/(4πε₀ (c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) )

A = (μ₀ q v (v × d ) ) / (4 π c² (c² |d|² - (v ·d )² ) )

Wait, but none of the options seem to match this exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, assuming that the denominator is (c² |d| - (d · v) ), but written as (d c - d · v ) in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider when the charge isn't moving, v =0. Then the potentials should reduce to the static case.

In the static case, V should be q/(4πε₀ |d| ), and A should be zero.

Looking at the options:

Option B: V = q/(4πε₀ r ), A = (v/c²) V. If v=0, then A=0, which is correct. But the problem is that V is 1/r, not 1/|d|.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v ) ). If v=0, denominator becomes d c, so V = (q c )/(4πε₀ d c ) )= q/(4πε₀ d ), which is correct. So when v=0, option C reduces to the static case correctly.

Similarly, for A in option C: When v=0, the numerator becomes zero, so A=0, which is correct.

So option C seems to handle the static case correctly. So that's a good sign.

Option D: When v=0, V becomes (q c )/(4 π ε₀ (d c) ), which is q/(4π ε₀ d ), which is correct, and A would be zero when v=0. But for the denominator, (d c + d ·v ), when v=0, it's d c, so same as option C in that case.

So both C and D handle the static case correctly. So that doesn't help.

Hmm, but when the charge is moving, the potentials should account for the motion.

Wait, another test: Consider when the charge is moving directly away from the observation point, i.e., d and v are in the same direction. So θ=0, cosθ=1.

Then, in option C, denominator becomes (d c - d v ) = d (c - v )

So V = (q c )/(4 π ε₀ d (c - v) )

Which can be rewritten as V = [ q/(4 π ε₀ d) ] * [ c/(c - v) ]

But in this case, the charge is moving away, so the effective distance would increase. So the potential should decrease, which is what happens here because c/(c -v) is greater than 1 when v is positive.

Similarly, for option C, the vector potential would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π d (c - v) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, if the charge is moving towards the observation point, v is positive in the same direction as d. Then, (c - v) would be smaller, making V larger, which makes sense because the charge is approaching, increasing the field.

So option C seems plausible.

But I'm not entirely confident. Hmm.

Another approach: The potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. So, ∇×A should give the magnetic field, and -∇V - ∂A/∂t should give the electric field.

But perhaps that's too involved for this step.

Alternatively, I'll think about the given options and which one correctly includes the velocity dependence.

Option C has A proportional to v, which makes sense. Option B has A proportional to v, but V is static.

Option C's denominator is (d c - d ·v ), which, when v is parallel to d, becomes d (c - v). That makes sense, as the denominator becomes smaller when v approaches c, which is correct because of the Lorentz factor.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The observation point is \( \vec{r} \), and \( \vec{d} \) is the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to \( \vec{r} \). The goal is to analyze the given options and identify the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \)
   - The scalar potential \( V \) is given by Coulomb's law, but it incorrectly uses \( r \) (the distance from the origin) instead of \( |\vec{d}| \) (the distance from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to \( \vec{r} \)). Additionally, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v^2} \), which is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \). **Option A is incorrect.**

2. **Option B**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \)
   - The scalar potential \( V \) again incorrectly uses \( r \) instead of \( |\vec{d}| \). While the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \), the static form of \( V \) makes this option inconsistent with the motion of the charge. **Option B is incorrect.**

3. **Option C**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - The denominator \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) is problematic because \( d \) is a scalar (the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \)), and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is a scalar. This leads to a dimensionally inconsistent expression. However, if \( d \) is interpreted as the magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \), the denominator becomes \( (c |\vec{d}| - (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})) \), which is dimensionally consistent. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) both have the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \) and \( |\vec{d}| \), and they reduce to the static case (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)) correctly. **Option C is plausible.**

4. **Option D**:
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \)
   - Similar to Option C, the denominator \( (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \) is dimensionally inconsistent because \( d \) is a scalar, and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is a scalar. If \( d \) is interpreted as \( |\vec{d}| \), the denominator becomes \( (c |\vec{d}| + (\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})) \), which does not align with the expected relativistic corrections to the potentials. Additionally, the plus sign in the denominator is inconsistent with the expected subtraction of the velocity term. **Option D is incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most consistent with the expected forms of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge. While the denominator in Option C is written ambiguously, interpreting \( d \) as \( |\vec{d}| \) makes it dimensionally consistent and correctly incorporates the velocity dependence. The static case (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)) also reduces correctly to Coulomb's law for \( V \) and zero for \( \vec{A} \).

**Answer: C**
