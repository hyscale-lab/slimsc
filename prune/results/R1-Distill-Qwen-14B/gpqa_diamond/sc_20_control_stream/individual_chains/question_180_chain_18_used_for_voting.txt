Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me just read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. All the particles have negligible mass. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, in Joules, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm. So I remember that when dealing with electric potential energy, especially for charges in a system, it's about considering the potential each charge contributes and how they interact.

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P, I'm thinking that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge (number 13). So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed one.

But wait, the problem also says it's an isolated system. That probably means we can't bring in any external work, so the energy must be calculated considering all the interactions between the charges.

So the system has 13 charges, each of 2e. Since all are identical, the interactions would be between each pair. But in this case, the 13th is fixed, and the others are fixed at 2 meters from P.

Wait, but how is their configuration arranged? Are the 12 charges placed on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P? Because that would make sense if they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So the 13th is at the center, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify how the 12 are arranged around P. But for the minimum energy, I think the configuration that would minimize the potential energy is when the charges are as far apart as possible from each other. Wait, no, actually, the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are positive (because each is 2e, and e is positive), the potential energy between any two would be positive. So to minimize the total potential energy, we'd want to minimize the sum of all the individual pair potentials.

Wait, but wait. Since all the charges are positive, bringing them closer together would increase the potential energy, right? So to minimize the energy, the charges should be placed as far apart as possible. But in our case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their positions are fixed relative to the 13th charge. How about their arrangement relative to each other?

Oh wait, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances can vary, but perhaps the problem assumes that they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. But since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, maybe we can just model it as each of the 12 being at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, but when calculating the potential energy of the entire system, there are two contributions: the energy due to the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts:

1. The potential energy between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges (each at 2m from P).

2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, since all 12 are identical and at 2m from P, perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron or some symmetric arrangement. But I'm not sure about the exact number, but perhaps each pair is separated by some distance, say r. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to calculate the mutual potential between each pair of the 12.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the interaction between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not considering their mutual interactions? Because that would simplify things. But I don't think so. Because the problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read it. "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P." So the 12 are each at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. So in that case, perhaps it's assumed that the 12 are all at a distance of 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other are such that their mutual distances can vary. But I think the problem is probably considering the 12 charges as being fixed on the sphere of radius 2m, and their mutual distances are all the same, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are placed at the same point? No, that can't be right, because then they'd be infinitely close, and the potential energy would be huge, which contradicts the idea of finding the minimum.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only the potential between each of the 12 charges and the 13th fixed charge, but not the potential between the 12 charges themselves. Because perhaps the 12 charges are constrained not only to be at 2m from P but also to not move relative to each other, but that's not stated.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary. But perhaps in the minimal energy configuration, the charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy between them is minimized. Since all charges are positive, the potential energy between any two increases as they get closer. So to minimize the total potential energy, the 12 charges should be as far apart as possible from each other as allowed by the constraints.

But the problem is that without knowing their exact arrangement, it's hard to calculate. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential between the 12 charges and the 13th, not their mutual interactions. That would make the problem solvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are much larger than 2 meters, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy between the 13th charge and the other 12, and not the potential between the 12 themselves. Because that would make the problem solvable without knowing their arrangement.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about what the options are. The options are all in the 1e-26 order, except D which is 122. So the correct answer is probably one of the first three options.

So let's proceed under the assumption that the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and each of the 12. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies for each pair between the 13th and the others.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, where the 13th is fixed. So each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th also has 2e.

The potential energy for each of these pairs is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m), where m is the distance, which is 2 meters.

Wait, but wait: the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2) / r. So for each of the 12 charges and the 13th, it's U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2).

So for each of the 12, the energy is (k * (2e)^2)/2. So 12 such terms would be 12 * (k*(4e²))/2 = 12 * (2 k e²) )= 24 k e².

So that's one part. But wait, isn't the 13th charge also interacting with each of the 12, so that's 12 interactions, each with energy (k * 2e * 2e)/2. So 12 * (4 e² k) /2 = 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

But wait, is that correct? Let me compute that again. Each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and the fixed charge is also 2e. The distance is 2m.

So for each pair, U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (4 e² k) / (2m) )= 2 e² k / m.

But m is 2 meters, so 2 / 2 = 1. So each pair contributes (2 e² k) / 2 meters? Wait, no, wait, wait: m is 2 in denominator. So 4 e² k / (2 * 2). Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 2e * 2e = 4 e². The distance is 2 meters.

So U per pair is (k * 4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So for each of the 12 interactions (each of the 12 charges with the 13th), the energy is 2 k e². So 12 of these give 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, wait. Potential energy is a property of the system, so when you consider the 13th charge interacting with each of the 12, each interaction is counted once. So yes, 12 terms each contributing 2 k e².

But that's not all. Because the 12 charges are themselves interacting with each other. So each pair among the 12 contributes additional potential energy.

So the total potential energy is the sum of two parts:

1. The energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.
2. The energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But without knowing the arrangement of the 12 charges, it's impossible to compute the second part. So maybe the problem is only considering the first part, or perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are much larger than 2 meters, making their mutual potential negligible compared to the energy from the 13th charge. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that they form a symmetric configuration, like a regular dodecahedron, but I don't know the exact formula for that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual potential of the 12. Because otherwise, the problem would require more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are all the same. For example, if they form a regular icosahedron around P, each pair would be at the same distance from each other.

Wait, but how many charges are there? 12. So perhaps they form something like a cuboctahedron? Or maybe a regular dodecahedron? I'm not exactly sure of the exact distances in such arrangements.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged on a circle, equidistant from each other and from P. But that would be a 2D arrangement, and perhaps the mutual distances are all the same. Let me imagine that arrangement.

If the 12 are equally spaced on a circle of radius 2 meters, then the distance between any two adjacent charges would be 2 * 2 * sin(π/12) ), because for a circle, the chord length is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. For 12 equally spaced points, theta is 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). So sin(15 degrees) is approximately 0.2588.

So chord length would be 2 * 2 * sin(15 degrees) = 4 * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 meters.

So each pair of adjacent charges is about 1.035 meters apart. But that's just the adjacent ones. The next ones would be further apart.

But wait, to compute the mutual potential energy between all pairs, I would have to compute for each pair of the 12 charges, the distance between them, and then sum up all the (k * (2e)^2) / r terms.

But without knowing the exact distances between all pairs, this seems impossible. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and the 12, not the mutual potential of the 12 themselves. That would make the problem solvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are all much larger, making their mutual potential negligible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and the mutual potential is neglected because the 12 are at a fixed distance (so their positions don't change, so their mutual potential energy is a constant and doesn't affect the minimum energy in this setup).

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual potential energy. Since all are positive, the mutual potential would be positive, so putting them as far apart as possible would minimize the energy.

Wait, but how? Because they are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So the maximum possible mutual separation would be when they are arranged as far apart as possible on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps the maximum mutual separation is when they form a regular dodecahedron or some other arrangement where each is as far from others as possible. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to compute the exact potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is zero or negligible, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th and the 12, and the mutual potential is not considered. So in that case, the total energy would be 12 times the potential between each pair of the 13th and a 12th.

So let's proceed with that assumption, even though I'm not entirely certain.

So each interaction between the 13th and a 12th contributes (k * (2e)^2) / (2 meters).

So that's (k * 4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So 12 such interactions give 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 Coulombs.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N m²/C².

So let's compute 24 * k * e².

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38 C².

Then, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

First compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 ≈ 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 ≈ 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23. (8 * 2.5 is 20, 0.988*2.5≈2.47, so about 22.47). So 22.47 x 10^(9-38) = 22.47 x 10^-29.

Then multiply by 24: 22.47 * 24 = 539.28.

So 539.28 x 10^-29 = 5.3928e-26.

Wait, but wait: 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) = 24 * (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 *2.566 ≈ let me compute that accurately.

8.988 * 2.566:

Let me compute 8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ (approx 1 * 2.566) - (0.012 * 2.566)= 2.566 - 0.0308= approx 2.535.

So total ≈ 20.528 + 2.535 = 23.063.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.063 *24 = ?

23 * 24 = 552.

0.063 *24 = 1.512.

So total ≈ 553.512.

So 553.512e-29 = 5.53512e-26.

Wait, 553.512e-29 is 5.53512e-26.

So that's approximately 5.535e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is close but a bit higher. Option B is about half that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me recompute the numbers more accurately.

Compute e²:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 x (1e-38) ≈ 2.5669699 x 1e-38 C².

So e² ≈ 2.56697e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So k * e² = 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Calculating 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56697e-38 = (8.9875517879 * 2.56697) x 1e9 *1e-38.

Compute 8.98755 * 2.56697:

Let me compute 8 * 2.56697 = 20.53576.

0.98755 *2.56697 ≈ let's compute:

0.9 *2.56697 = 2.310273.

0.08755 *2.56697 ≈ approx 0.08755 *2.5 = 0.218875, plus 0.08755 *0.06697≈ ~0.00587. So total ≈ 0.218875 + 0.00587 = 0.224745.

So total 0.98755 *2.56697 ≈ 2.310273 + 0.224745 ≈ 2.535018.

So 8.98755 *2.56697 ≈ 20.53576 + 2.535018 ≈ 23.070778.

So 23.070778 x 1e-29 (since 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29).

So 23.070778e-29 J.

Now, multiply by 24: 23.070778e-29 *24 = 23.070778 *24 = let's compute.

23 *24=552.

0.070778 *24 ≈ 1.69867.

Total ≈553.69867.

So 553.69867e-29 J = 5.5369867e-26 J.

So approximately 5.537e-26 J.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Hmm, the computed value is approximately 5.537e-26, which is closest to option A (5.645e-26), but a bit lower. The difference is about 0.107e-26, which is about 1.07e-27. That's a tenth of a percent difference. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 or something. Wait, what was the initial assumption?

The initial assumption was that the problem only considers the energy between the 13th and each of the 12, but not the mutual energy between the 12 themselves.

But maybe the mutual energy between the 12 charges is also part of the calculation, and in that case, the energy would be higher, making option A correct.

But wait, in reality, the mutual energy would add to the total, so without knowing the mutual arrangement, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, such that their mutual potential is zero. But that's not possible because all charges are positive.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are all at the same point, but that would make their mutual potential enormous because they're all close together. But that's not the case for minimum energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is considered, but the calculation is more involved.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential between the 12 charges is being considered, and the calculation involves the sum of all pairs. So each pair among the 12 contributes (k * (2e)^2) / r, where r is the distance between them.

But without knowing the exact value of r, it's tricky. So perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that all the mutual distances are 2 meters as well. Wait, but that's not possible because you can't have 12 identical charges all 2 meters apart from each other in 3D space; the maximum you can have with each pair at 2m is a certain number, but 12 might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, and the mutual distances are roughly the same as the sphere's diameter, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron, and each is equally distant from each other. But I don't remember the exact distance for a regular dodecahedron.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is zero because the configuration is such that the potential cancels out, but that's only possible if the charges are arranged in a certain way, like symmetrically opposite, but 12 is an even number.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges would interact with 11 others. So each contributes (k* (2e)^2)/r, where r is the distance between each pair. Without knowing r, I can't compute this.

Given that, perhaps the problem is only considering the interaction between the 13th and the 12, and the mutual interaction between the 12 is zero for some reason, which doesn't make sense. But perhaps the mutual potential is negligible compared to the other term.

But then why is the computed value around 5.5e-26, but the option is 5.645e-26. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Compute k * e²: 8.98755e9 * (1.602176634e-19)^2.

Compute 1.602176634e-19 squared:

(1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 x 1e-38.

1.602176634 squared is approximately 2.56697.

So 2.56697e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.98755e9 N·m²/C²:

8.98755e9 * 2.56697e-38 = (8.98755 * 2.56697) x 1e9 x 1e-38.

8.98755 * 2.56697 ≈ 23.070777.

So 23.070777e-29 J.

Multiply by 24:

24 * 23.070777e-29 = 553.6986e-29 = 5.536986e-26 J.

So approximately 5.537e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (5.645e-26), which is higher than my calculation. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2. Oh! Because when calculating the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, each pair is counted once. But perhaps when you have the 13th charge fixed at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m, the energy for each pair is (k * q1 * q2)/r, which is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m.

Wait wait, no, in the calculation above, it was 2 meters, so r=2.

Wait,  I think I did it correctly. So why is this not matching the options?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the 13th charge is fixed, but the other 12 are arranged in such a way that each is at 2m from P, but not necessarily all at the same distance from each other. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy from the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions, which would make the energy 5.537e-26 J. But none of the options are exactly that. The closest is A (5.645e-26), which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 8.98755e9 is 8.98755 x 10^9.

e² is 2.56697e-38.

Multiply 8.98755e9 * 2.56697e-38:

= (8.98755 * 2.56697) x 10^(9-38) = 23.070777 x 10^-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 23.070777e-29 = 553.6986e-29 = 5.536986e-26.

So 5.537e-26 J.

But option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 0.108e-26 higher.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k = 9e9.

Then, 9e9 * 2.56697e-38 = 23.10273e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.10273 *24 = 554.46552e-29 = 5.5446552e-26.

Still closer to 5.54e-26, which is still not matching A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed such that each is at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are arranged in a way that their mutual potential is zero. But that's not possible because all are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single entity, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem only considers the potential energy of the 13th charge with the 12, and the mutual potential is zero. That would make the total energy 5.537e-26 J, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only one charge from the 12, not all 12. But that doesn't make sense because the question says 12 are at 2m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point as each other, but that would make their mutual distance zero, which would lead to infinite potential energy, which can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the potential between them cancels out. But how?

Wait, perhaps when you have an even number of charges arranged symmetrically, their mutual potentials cancel out. For example, if you have two charges of +2e each, placed symmetrically around P, their mutual potential would be negative, but wait, they're both positive, so their potential would be positive.

Wait, no. The potential between two positive charges is positive. So arranging them symmetrically doesn't cancel their mutual potential. So that doesn't help.

Hmm, perhaps the mutual potential is considered but the problem provides a different arrangement.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential is zero. But that's impossible because all are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, but the 12 are arranged in a way that each is diametrically opposite to another, leading to some cancellation, but again, since all are positive, it doesn't cancel.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, but each of the 12 is being counted once as a fixed point, but perhaps I'm overcounting.

Wait, no, because each of the 12 is a distinct particle, and each interacts with the 13th charge once.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is being brought from infinity to their position at 2 meters away from P, and the work done is the potential energy.

In that case, the potential energy would be the sum of bringing each charge to its position, considering the potential created by the 13th charge and the previously placed charges.

Wait, but that complicates things, as each charge is placed in the potential of the 13th and all previously placed charges.

Wait, but in this case, because the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps the potential energy can be calculated as 12 times the energy needed to bring each charge from infinity to 2 meters, considering only the 13th charge's potential, because when bringing each charge, the potential from the other 11 hasn't been created yet.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me think: when bringing the first charge from infinity to 2 meters away, the only potential it feels is from the 13th charge. The second charge also feels the 13th charge's potential, plus the potential from the first charge. But since all are identical, each time you bring a charge, you have to account for the potential created by the existing charges.

So the total potential energy would be the sum for each charge of the work done to bring it to its position, which is the charge multiplied by the potential at that position due to all the other charges already placed.

So for the first charge: U1 = (2e) * V, where V is the potential at 2m due to the 13th charge (since no other 12 charges are there yet).

V = (k * 2e) / 2.

So U1 = (2e) * (k * 2e / 2) )= 2e * k e.

Wait, no: V = k * (2e) / (2m).

So U1 = (2e) * (k * 2e / 2) )= 2e * (k e).

Wait, no: (2e) * (k * 2e/2) )= (2e) * (k e) )= 2 k e².

Wait, that would be the work done for the first charge.

But when bringing the second charge, the potential at 2m would be due to the 13th charge and the first charge.

So V2 = (k * 2e)/(2) + (k * 2e)/(r21), where r21 is the distance between the second charge and the first charge.

But in this case, the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically, so perhaps r21 is the same for all pairs.

Wait, but without knowing r21, it's impossible. So perhaps this approach is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of all possible pairs. That would include the 13th charge and each of the 12, and each pair among the 12.

But again, without knowing the mutual distances, it's impossible.

But the problem is probably intended to consider only the 13th and the 12, not their mutual interactions. So perhaps the correct answer is 5.537e-26, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because then the potential between them would be infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th, but the mutual distances between the 12 are 2 meters as well, which doesn't make sense because you can't have 12 points all 2 meters apart from each other in 3D space.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges to be at a distance of 2 meters from P, but each at a different point, such that their mutual distances vary. But without knowing the exact distances, it's impossible to compute their mutual potential.

Given the time I've spent and the fact that the computed value without mutual energy is about 5.537e-26, which is closest to option A (5.645e-26), but not exactly matching, I'm starting to think that perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, wait a minute. The problem states that all 13 charges are identical, each with charge 2e. So each has a charge of 2e.

Wait, in the calculation, I considered each interaction between the 13th and the 12 as (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m. That's correct.

But what if the 13th charge was initially at rest, and each of the 12 charges is brought into place one by one. But each time a charge is brought, the potential at that point is due to the 13th charge and all previously placed charges.

Wait, perhaps let's model it that way.

Total potential energy would be the sum of the work done to bring each charge.

First, the 13th charge is fixed at P.

Bring the first charge from infinity to 2 meters away. The potential at that point is V1 = (k * 2e) / 2.

Work done (energy) is q * V = (2e) * (k * 2e)/(2) )= (2e) * (k e) )= 2 k e².

Then, bring the second charge to another position 2m from P. The potential at that point is due to the 13th charge and the first charge.

So V2 = (k * 2e)/2 + (k * 2e)/r, where r is the distance between charge 1 and charge 2 (which is 2m if they're on a sphere, but wait, no, because they're both 2 meters from P, but their mutual distance depends on the angle between them).

Wait, but in this case, the mutual distance between two points on a sphere of radius 2 meters separated by an angle theta is given by the chord length formula: r = 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2) = 4 sin(theta/2).

Wait, but without knowing theta, I can't compute this. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2√2 meters, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated, and perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential between the 12 charges, considering only the 13th's contribution.

In that case, the energy would be approximately 5.537e-26 J, which is not exactly any of the options. The closest option is A) 5.645e-26.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact value more accurately.

Let me compute 24 * k * e² with precise numbers.

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566969935e-38 C².

Multiply k * e²: 8.9875517879e9 * 2.566969935e-38.

Compute 8.9875517879 * 2.566969935:

Using a calculator approach:

8.9875517879 * 2.566969935 ≈ let's compute step by step.

First, 8 * 2.56697 = 20.53576.

0.9875517879 * 2.56697 ≈ let's compute 0.98755 *2.56697.

Compute 0.9 * 2.56697 = 2.310273.

0.08 * 2.56697 = 0.2053576.

0.00755 * 2.56697 ≈ approx 0.01940.

So 2.310273 + 0.2053576 = 2.51563; plus 0.01940 gives 2.53503.

So total 8.98755 *2.56697 ≈ 20.53576 + 2.53503 ≈ 23.07079.

So 23.07079e-29 J for each of the 12 pairs.

Multiply by 24: 23.07079 * 24 = 553.699e-29 = 5.53699e-26 J.

So again, approximately 5.537e-26 J.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option A:5.645e-26.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the 13th charge has charge 2e. Let me check.

The problem says each of the 13 particles has charge 2e. So yes, 2e each.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as half of what I calculated?

Wait, no. Because each of the 12 interactions is counted once.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 12 times (k * (2e)^2 / 2), which is 12 * (4e² k / 2 )= 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses e as the elementary charge with e=1.6e-19, not the exact value.

Let me recalculate with e=1.6e-19.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

k=9e9.

So 9e9 *2.56e-38 = 23.04e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.04 *24=552.96e-29 =5.5296e-26.

Still around 5.53e-26.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential is zero, perhaps because they form a spherical shell, but I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed at 2m from P, but their mutual potential is zero because they're arranged in such a way that their contributions cancel out. But that would require negative charges, which they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically, but that's only possible if the number of charges is even and arranged in pairs, but all are positive, so their mutual potential would still be positive.

Hmm.

At this point, given the time I've spent and the fact that the calculated value is approximately 5.537e-26 J, which isn't an option, but option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 1.7% higher. Perhaps the intended answer is A, considering some approximation or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other as well, leading to a higher mutual potential. But without knowing the exact number, I can't compute that.

Another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, so each is at 2 meters. In that case, what's the distance between two charges? For an icosahedron, the edge length is the distance between any two adjacent vertices.

The formula for the edge length (a) of a regular icosahedron with radius r (distance from center to vertices) is a = r * sqrt(φ² +1), where φ is the golden ratio (~1.618). So a ≈ r * 1.902.

So if r=2, a ≈3.804 meters.

So each pair of charges is about 3.804 meters apart.

So the potential between each pair is (k * (2e)^2) / 3.804.

So for each pair of the 12 charges, the potential is U = (4e² k) /3.804.

Now, how many pairs are there among 12 charges? It's C(12,2) =66 pairs.

So the mutual potential energy is 66 * (4e² k)/(3.804).

Compute that: 66 * (4e² k)/(3.804).

Compute 4/3.804 ≈1.051.

So 66 * 1.051 = 69.366.

So mutual potential energy is 69.366 * e² k.

Now, the total potential energy is the sum of the interaction with the 13th charge and the mutual interactions.

Earlier, we had 24 e² k (from the 13th charge), and now 69.366 e² k from mutual.

Total: 24 + 69.366 =93.366 e² k.

Compute 93.366 * 8.98755e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, but wait, e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 93.366 *8.98755e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.98755e9 *2.566e-38 =23.07e-29.

Multiply by93.366: 23.07e-29 *93.366= 2155.8e-29=2.1558e-26 J.

So total energy is approximately 2.156e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is higher than this.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach isn't correct either.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is much smaller than the 13th's contribution. Or perhaps the charges are arranged such that their mutual potential is negligible compared to the interaction with the 13th charge.

Wait, in the earlier case where mutual potential is 2.156e-26 J, and the 13th's contribution is 5.537e-26 J, the mutual is about 39% of the total. So it's not negligible.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to proceed.

Given all this, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and one of the 12, leading to a much smaller value.

Wait, no, the problem says 12 charges, so all 12 must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, let me quickly compute what would give 2.822e-26.

Assume the total energy is 24 * k * e².

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38=23.07e-29.

24 *23.07e-29=553.69e-29=5.537e-26.

No, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential is 12 times the potential of one pair. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem might only consider the 13th charge's interaction with each of the 12, and the mutual potential is zero. So the energy is 24 * k * e², which is approximately 5.537e-26, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is A.

Wait, but the options have B as 2.822e-26, which is exactly half of 5.645e-26.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 4 meters, not 2 meters, from P. But no, the problem states 2 meters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 24 * k * e², and the correct factor is 12 instead of 24. Let me check:

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge once, so U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2) = 12 * (4 e² k )/2 = 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

Yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct answer should be approximately 5.537e-26 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering perhaps a different approach or a rounding difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy per charge, but no, the question asks for the system's energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are at 2m, but the 13th charge is also 2e, so the potential energy is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is as we calculated.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 5.537e-26 J, which is not among the options. But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the 13th charge is also moving or something. No, the 13th is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, so its potential is due to the other 12. So the energy is the potential energy of the 12 charges plus the potential energy of the 13th charge.

Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, so the potential at its location is due to the other 12. So the energy would be the sum of each pair's potential.

But I think I'm going in circles here.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the intended answer is option B, but I'm not certain. However, based on the calculations, the correct energy should be around 5.537e-26 J, which is closest to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system arises from two contributions: 

1. **Energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges**:  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge at a distance of 2 meters. The potential energy for each pair is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4e^2k}{2} = 2e^2k
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this contribution is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 12 \cdot 2e^2k = 24e^2k
   \]

2. **Mutual potential energy between the 12 charges**:  
   The problem does not specify the exact arrangement of the 12 charges relative to each other. If the charges are assumed to be symmetrically distributed on a sphere of radius 2 meters, their mutual distances would vary. However, without explicit information about their arrangement, the mutual potential energy cannot be precisely calculated. For simplicity, the problem may assume that the mutual potential energy is negligible or not explicitly required for the solution.

Assuming only the first contribution is considered, the total potential energy is:  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24e^2k
\]  
Substituting the values \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
\]  
First, calculate \( k \cdot e^2 \):  
\[
k \cdot e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 23.07 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{J}
\]  
Now multiply by 24:  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot 23.07 \times 10^{-29} = 553.69 \times 10^{-29} = 5.537 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]  

This calculated value (\( 5.537 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) is closest to option **A** (\( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)), though slightly lower. The discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or approximations in the constants used. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice is:

ANSWER: A
