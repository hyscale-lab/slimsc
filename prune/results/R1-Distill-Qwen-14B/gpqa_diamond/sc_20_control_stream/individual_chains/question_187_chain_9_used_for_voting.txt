Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I know.

First, the question is about detectability based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The options are stars a to f, and I have to choose how many of them meet this criterion.

I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. From what I recall, it's mounted on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Paranal. The key here is understanding the factors that affect S/N, which mainly depend on the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) because a brighter star (lower magnitude) gives a higher S/N.

Wait, right, the S/N ratio improves with the square root of the exposure time, but the exposure here is fixed at 1 hour, so each star's apparent magnitude will be the main determinant. Also, the distance and absolute magnitude determine the apparent magnitude.

So the absolute magnitude (M) is given for each star, and the distance (d) is given. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can estimate if the S/N is sufficient. I think ESPRESSO's performance depends on the brightness of the star. But wait, what's the typical S/N for ESPRESSO per pixel?

I might need to recall or look up the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve. Hmm, from what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph with a high S/N capability, but it's limited by the brightness of the star. For very bright stars, it's easier to get high S/N, but for fainter ones, it's harder.

Wait, but in my notes somewhere, I think for ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel depends on the star's flux. Let's say, for a typical star, if it's too faint, the S/N might drop below 10.

So, let's compute m for each star.

Option a: Canopus. Canopus is a bright star, right? Its apparent magnitude is about -0.74. So that's super bright. M is given? Wait, no, the options a, b, etc., have different information. Let me look again.

Wait, the question lists the stars as:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M=15 mag, 10 pc
d) Same as c but d=200 pc
e) Same as c but d=5 pc
f) Same as c but d=50 pc.

So for a) Canopus, I know it's a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.74, which is much brighter than the Sun (which is about 4.8). So for this star, the S/N would be very high. So a) is detectable.

b) Polaris is another star. Polaris is a well-known star, the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is about 1.97. So that's bright but not as bright as Canopus. So S/N would be good but let's see.

c) Star with M=15, at 10 pc. So calculate m. m = 15 +5*(log10(10/10))=15 +5*(0)=15. So m=15. That's pretty faint. Hmm, would ESPRESSO achieve S/N 10 per pixel for such a star in 1 hour? Probably not, because 15th magnitude is quite dim. I think ESPRESSO is more suited for brighter stars.

d) Same M=15 but d=200 pc. So m = 15 +5*log10(200/10) =15 +5*log10(20)=15 +5*(1.301)≈15+6.505=21.505. That's even fainter, so S/N would be lower. So d) is not detectable.

e) Same M=15 but d=5 pc. m=15 +5*log10(5/10)=15+5*log10(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15 -1.505=13.495. So about 13.5 magnitude. Hmm, is that bright enough?

f) Same M=15, d=50. m=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.495=18.495. So about 18.5, which is even fainter than m=15. So f) is not detectable.

Wait, but I need to calculate whether each star's apparent magnitude allows S/N ≥10.

I think the key is to determine how bright each star is in apparent magnitude, and then figure out if ESPRESSO can reach S/N 10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

I remember that for spectroscopy, the S/N per angstrom or per pixel depends on the photon count. But for this question, it's about per binned pixel. So maybe each binned pixel corresponds to a certain wavelength range.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the formula for S/N. The S/N is proportional to sqrt(N), where N is the number of photons detected. So for a given exposure time, the S/N depends on the flux of the star.

But without detailed specs, perhaps I can use some reference. Let's see, I think that ESPRESSO (when coupled with an 8m telescope) can achieve a certain S/N for stars down to a certain magnitude.

Wait, I found a source in my notes (or perhaps from ESO's documentation). The ESPRESSO spectrograph has a design goal to achieve S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for a V=10 magnitude star in 1 hour using a single 8.2m telescope. That's from the ESO website.

Wait, so if a V=10 star gives S/N=100 in 1 hour, then for fainter stars, the S/N decreases. So if a star is V= m, then the S/N scales as (10 / 5^( (m - 10)/2.5 )) ), but wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux.

Wait, let's think in terms of how S/N scales with magnitude. The formula for S/N is S/N ∝ sqrt(10^{0.4*(m - m0)}), where m0 is the reference magnitude, and S/N0 is the S/N at m0.

So, if for m=10, S/N=100, then for m=15, S/N = 100 * sqrt(10^{0.4*(15-10)}) = 100 * sqrt(10^2) = 100 * 10 = 1000? Wait that can't be right. Wait, no—wait, that approach is wrong. Wait, actually, the number of photons is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), because each magnitude step is a factor of 10^(-0.4) in flux.

So S/N scales as sqrt(10^(-0.4*(m - m0))).

Wait, let me rephrase. Let's define m0 as the reference magnitude, which in this case is m0=10, with S/N0=100. Then for any other magnitude m, the S/N would be S/N = S/N0 * 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

Wait, because the number of photons scales as 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), and S/N scales as sqrt(number of photons), so sqrt(10^(-0.4*(m - m0))) ) = 10^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

So S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(m - 10)).

So let's compute this for each star.

Option a) Canopus: m = -0.74. So:

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(-0.74 - 10)) ) = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(-10.74)) ) = 100 * 10^(2.148) ≈ 100 * 139.3 ≈ 13930. So way above 10. So a) is detectable.

Option b) Polaris: m=1.97.

S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(1.97 - 10)) = 100 * 10^(-0.2*(-8.03)) )= 100 * 10^(1.606) ≈ 100 * 39.8 ≈ 3980. Also way above 10. So b) is detectable.

Option c) m=15.

S/N =100 * 10^(-0.2*(15-10)) = 100 *10^(-0.2*5) )= 100 *10^(-1) = 100 * 0.1 =10. Exactly 10. So c) is detectable.

Option d) m=21.5.

S/N=100 *10^(-0.2*(21.5-10)) =100 *10^(-0.2*11.5)=100 *10^-2.3 ≈ 100 *0.0501 ≈5.01 <10. So d) is not detectable.

Option e) m=13.5.

S/N=100 *10^(-0.2*(13.5-10))=100 *10^(-0.2*3.5)=100 *10^-0.7 ≈100 *0.2 ≈20. So e) is detectable.

Option f) m=18.5.

S/N=100 *10^(-0.2*(18.5-10))=100 *10^(-0.2*8.5)=100 *10^-1.7≈100 *0.02≈2. So <10. Not detectable.

So now, count how many are detectable.

a) yes
b) yes
c) yes (since S/N=10)
d) no
e) yes
f) no

Wait, wait. Let me recount:

a) Canopus: detectable (S/N ~13930)
b) Polaris: detectable (S/N ~3980)
c) m=15: S/N=10 → yes
d) m=21.5: no
e) m=13.5: S/N=20 → yes
f) m=18.5: no.

So that's a, b, c, e. So four stars.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for e).

m=13.5.

S/N =100 *10^(-0.2*(13.5-10))=100 *10^(-0.2*3.5)=100 *10^-0.7.

What's 10^-0.7? 10^0.3 is about 2, so 10^-0.7 is about 0.2. So 100 *0.2=20. So yes, e) is detectable.

So that's four stars: a, b, c, e.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Options given are:

A) 2

B) 5

C) 4

D) 3

So the answer would be C) 4.

But wait, the question lists the options as a to f, but the question is how many are detectable.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought only a, b, c, e are detectable, which is four. So answer is 4, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again about the stars. Are there any other factors I'm missing?

Wait, the question also states that the star must be detectable when using ESPRESSO with one of the 8m VLT telescopes. Are there any other limitations, like the star's position (RA and Dec)? Because the stars c, d, e, f all have RA=0 and Dec=0, which is the same as the Galactic center (RA 0h, Dec -29, wait, no, that's the Galactic center. Wait, no, Dec 0 is the celestial equator. Oh, but the VLT is in Paranal, which is at a certain latitude. So if a star is too far from the zenith, it might have lower atmospheric transmission or lower observing efficiency.

Wait, but the stars in options c, d, e, f are all at RA=0, DEC=0, which is the same as the Galactic center (wait, no, Galactic center is RA 17h45m, Dec -29). Wait, no, DEC 0 is the celestial equator. So RA 0 is the same as the March equinox point. So for Paranal Observatory, which is in the southern hemisphere (I think it's at about 24.6° S latitude), a star at Dec 0 would be on the celestial equator. So when it's at the zenith, it's 24.6° north of the zenith, but I think that's not a big issue. Wait, does that affect the S/N? I think it would, because the atmospheric extinction is worse when looking through more atmosphere, i.e., when the star is lower in the sky.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any extinction or atmospheric effects, so perhaps we're to assume that it's a perfect observing condition and that the star is at an optimal position (like on the meridian, so highest in the sky). So perhaps we can ignore that factor for this calculation.

So, unless I'm missing something else, the answer is 4 stars (a, b, c, e), so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) for each star using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10),
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The detectability of a star depends on whether the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel is at least 10 during a 1-hour exposure. ESPRESSO's performance is such that for a star with \( m = 10 \), the S/N is 100. For fainter stars, the S/N decreases as:

\[
\text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(m - 10)}.
\]

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option a: Canopus**  
   Canopus has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.74 \). Substituting into the S/N formula:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(-0.74 - 10)} = 100 \cdot 10^{2.148} \approx 13,930.
   \]
   The S/N is much higher than 10, so Canopus is detectable.

2. **Option b: Polaris**  
   Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 1.97 \). Substituting into the S/N formula:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(1.97 - 10)} = 100 \cdot 10^{1.606} \approx 3,980.
   \]
   The S/N is much higher than 10, so Polaris is detectable.

3. **Option c: Star with \( M = 15, d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.
   \]
   Substituting into the S/N formula:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(15 - 10)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-1} = 10.
   \]
   The S/N is exactly 10, so this star is detectable.

4. **Option d: Star with \( M = 15, d = 200 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200/10) = 15 + 5 \cdot 1.301 \approx 21.505.
   \]
   Substituting into the S/N formula:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(21.505 - 10)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-2.3} \approx 5.01.
   \]
   The S/N is less than 10, so this star is not detectable.

5. **Option e: Star with \( M = 15, d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 15 + 5 \cdot (-0.301) \approx 13.495.
   \]
   Substituting into the S/N formula:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(13.495 - 10)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.7} \approx 20.
   \]
   The S/N is higher than 10, so this star is detectable.

6. **Option f: Star with \( M = 15, d = 50 \, \text{pc} \)**  
   Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50/10) = 15 + 5 \cdot 0.699 \approx 18.495.
   \]
   Substituting into the S/N formula:
   \[
   \text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(18.495 - 10)} = 100 \cdot 10^{-1.7} \approx 2.
   \]
   The S/N is less than 10, so this star is not detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are **a (Canopus)**, **b (Polaris)**, **c (star with \( M = 15, d = 10 \, \text{pc} \))**, and **e (star with \( M = 15, d = 5 \, \text{pc} \))**. Thus, a total of **4 stars** are detectable.
