Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the minimum resolution. I think resolution in this context refers to the ability to distinguish particles, maybe the distance over which the decay products can be detected. So perhaps it's about the minimum distance the decay can be observed, which depends on the lifetime and the speed of the particle.

So, I remember that the lifetime of a moving particle is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But how does that apply here?

The Lorentz factor γ is given by E/(m c²), right? Because relativistic energy E is γ m c². So since E is given, and the mass m is given, I can find γ.

Wait, E is the total energy, which is 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So γ = E / (m c²). But since both are in GeV, the units might work out. Let me calculate that.

So γ = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.918. So approximately 7.92.

Then, the lifetime τ = γ τ₀ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.92 * 8 is about 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s. Wait, 7.92 *8e-16 is 63.36e-16? Or 6.336e-15? Wait, no, 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so 63.36 ×1e-16 s = 6.336 ×1e-15 seconds.

Wait, I think I should be precise. 7.92 multiplied by 8e-16 is 63.36e-16, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part. The decay length is how far the particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is v * τ, where v is the velocity.

But wait, v can be found from the energy. Alternatively, since we have γ, and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), perhaps we can find v in terms of γ.

Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, but maybe it's easier to find beta, β = v/c.

Hmm, beta is v/c. So, from E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². And p = gamma m v. So, E² = (gamma² m² v² c²) + (gamma² m² c^4) (since m c² squared is m² c^4). Wait, maybe a different approach.

Wait, the relation between energy, mass, and beta is:

E = γ m c²

p = γ m v = γ m β c

So, beta can be found from β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let me compute that. Plugging in the numbers:

E =27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

So m² c^4 = (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2, and E² = (27)^2 (GeV)^2.

So, m² c^4 / E² = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - m² c^4/E² ≈ 0.98405.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

So β ≈ 0.992 c.

So v ≈ 0.992 c. Okay, but maybe I can be more precise.

Alternatively, since the total energy is E = γ m c², and γ is 7.92 as I found earlier, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, gamma is 7.92, so 1/gamma squared is 1/(7.92)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405, whose square root is about 0.992, as before. So beta is approximately 0.992.

So v is about 0.992c.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. So L = β c * τ.

So we have τ as 6.336e-15 s. Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.992 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.336e-15 s: 2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = ?

Let me compute 2.976 *6.336 ≈ let's see. 3 *6 is 18, 3 *0.336 is 1.008, 0.976 *6 is 5.856, etc. Maybe more accurately:

6.336 * 2.976 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 2.976 = 17.856. 0.336 *2.976 = about 1.000 (since 0.3 *3 is 0.9, plus 0.036*3=0.108, so 0.9 +0.108=1.008, but 0.336 is a bit more than 0.3, so maybe 1.000). So total around 18.856.

Wait, but 2.976 is approximately 3 - 0.024.

So 6.336 * (3 -0.024) = 6.336 *3 -6.336 *0.024.

6.336 *3 = 19.008.

6.336 *0.024 = 0.152064.

So 19.008 - 0.152064 = 18.855936.

So 6.336 *2.976 ≈18.856.

So 2.976e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) *1e8 * 1e-15 = 18.856 *1e-7 = 1.8856e-6 meters.

Wait, wait—because 1e8 times 1e-15 is 1e-7. So 18.856e-7 meters.

Which is 1.8856e-6 meters, or approximately 1.886e-6 meters.

Hmm. So L ≈ 1.886e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps I need to compute the distance such that 30% of the decays are observed, and find the required resolution.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the observed lifetime is longer because of time dilation, leading to longer decay length. The minimum resolution is the shortest distance the chamber can detect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps it's the length L such that 30% of the particles decay within that length. Or maybe it's the mean decay length, and the resolution needs to be such that at least 30% are within that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the decay length such that the probability of decaying within that length is 30%. So the decay follows an exponential probability.

Wait, the decay probability is P = 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where t is the time the particle is moving. But in this case, the distance L is what we're interested in.

But L = v t, so t = L / v.

So the probability P is 1 - e^{-L/(v τ)}.

Wait, but v is β c, and τ is γ τ₀.

Alternatively, since v = β c, and τ = γ τ₀, then L = β c τ.

Wait, but I'm trying to find L such that P = 30% (0.3) is the probability of decaying within that length.

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(β c τ)}.

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(β c τ)}.

So e^{-L/(β c τ)} = 0.7.

Take natural log of both sides:

-L/(β c τ) = ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

Multiply both sides by -1:

L/(β c τ) = 0.35667.

So L = β c τ * 0.35667.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, the mean decay length is L_avg = β c τ.

So the probability of decaying within a distance L is P = 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}.

So if P = 0.3, then 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}, so e^{-L/L_avg} = 0.7, so L = - L_avg ln(0.7).

Which is L = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg * 0.35667.

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

Wait, but earlier I computed L_avg as about 1.886e-6 meters.

So 0.35667 * 1.886e-6 ≈ let's compute that.

1.886e-6 * 0.35667.

Hmm, 1.886 *0.35667 is about 0.67, so 0.67e-6 meters, or 6.7e-7 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Option B is 2.08e-9 m.

Option C is 2.08e-1 m.

Option D is 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, none of these is around 6.7e-7 m. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of L_avg. Let me recalculate.

Wait, earlier I found that τ = gamma tau_0 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s = 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 s.

Then, L_avg = beta c tau.

Beta is 0.992 c, so beta c is 0.992 c²? No, wait: beta c is 0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.

Wait, no, wait: beta is 0.992, so beta c is 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Compute that: 2.976e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) *1e-7.

Earlier, I calculated 2.976 *6.336 as about 18.856.

So 18.856e-7 m = 1.8856e-6 m, which is 1.886e-6 meters.

So L_avg is approximately 1.886e-6 m.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think we're looking for the decay length L such that the probability of decay within L is 30% (0.3).

So using the formula:

P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}.

We set P=0.3, so:

0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}

e^{-L/L_avg} = 0.7

Take ln:

-L/L_avg = ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

Thus, L = 0.35667 * 1.886e-6 m ≈ 0.67e-6 m, which is 6.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta or gamma.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation.

E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 27/(3.41) ≈ 7.9178. So that's correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, (m c²) = 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV.

So (m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2.

E^2 = (27)^2 (GeV)^2.

So (m c²)^2 / E^2 = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2≈0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= 0.99202, as before.

So beta is about 0.992 c. That seems correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is that I need to compute the minimum distance so that at least 30% of the particles decay within that distance.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the resolution of the chamber, which is the length that can be distinguished, so the minimum distance that the decay products are separated. So perhaps the minimum length that can be observed is the decay length, so the resolution should be at least as large as the decay length, so that the decay can be detected.

Wait, but then the problem is just to compute the decay length, which is L_avg. But earlier I found that L_avg is approximately 1.886e-6 m. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. Hmm, maybe I made a precise calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate L_avg more accurately.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 = exact value.

27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *7.9= 27.059. So 7.9 is 3.41 *7.9= 27.059, which is a bit over 27. So 27 /3.41 = approximately 7.917.

So gamma is 7.9178.

So tau = gamma * tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So 7.9178 *8e-16 = 63.3424e-16 s =6.33424e-15 s.

Now, beta c is 0.992 *3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.

So L_avg = beta c * tau = 2.976e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s.

Multiply 2.976e8 by6.33424e-15.

2.976 *6.33424 = let's calculate.

2 *6.33424=12.66848.

0.976 *6.33424.

0.9*6.33424=5.700816.

0.07*6.33424=0.4433968.

0.006 *6.33424=0.03800544.

Add: 5.700816 + 0.4433968=6.1442128 +0.03800544=6.1822182.

So total 12.66848 +6.1822182=18.8506982.

So 18.8506982e-7 m = 1.88506982e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.885e-6 meters.

So L_avg is about 1.885e-6 m.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the minimum resolution is the length L such that 30% of decays occur within L. So I need to find L where P=0.3.

Earlier, I found L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

So 0.35667 *1.885e-6 ≈ 0.67e-6 m, 6.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the P equation. Let me think again. The decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability that the decay occurs before time t is P = 1 - e^{-t/tau}. But in terms of distance, t = L/(beta c), so P =1 -e^{-L/(beta c tau)}.

Wait, beta c tau is L_avg.

So P =1 - e^{-L / L_avg}.

Which is what I had before. So with P=0.3, L = L_avg * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, ln(1/(0.7)) is ln(10/7) ≈ 0.35667.

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

So 0.35667 *1.885e-6 = approximately 0.67e-6 meters.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is asking for the L_avg, which is about 1.885e-6 m. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 = let's compute precisely.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = approximately 0.9179.

So 7.9179. So gamma is 7.9179.

Tau=gamma * tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=63.3432e-16=6.33432e-15 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E²)).

Compute m/E =3.41/27=0.126296.

So (m/E)^2=0.015949.

So 1 -0.015949=0.984051.

sqrt(0.984051)=approx 0.991997.

So beta c =0.991997 *3e8 m/s=2.97599e8 m/s.

So L_avg= beta c * tau=2.97599e8 *6.33432e-15.

Compute 2.97599e8 *6.33432e-15.

Multiply 2.97599 *6.33432= let's calculate.

2 *6.33432=12.66864.

0.97599 *6.33432.

Compute 0.9 *6.33432=5.700888.

0.07 *6.33432=0.4434024.

0.00599*6.33432≈0.03784.

Total:5.700888 +0.4434024=6.1442904 +0.03784=6.1821304.

So total 12.66864 +6.1821304=18.8507704.

So 18.8507704e-7 m =1.885077e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So L_avg is 1.885e-6 meters, but none of the options is that. The closest is A: 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, gamma = E/(m c²). Since E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, gamma is 27/3.41 = approximately 7.9178.

Wait another thought: How precise is the calculation? The options are given as 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08e-6. If I see my L_avg as 1.885e-6, perhaps that's 1.885e-6, which is approximately 2e-6. But the option is 2.08e-6, which is about 20% larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise beta.

Wait, the exact value of beta can be calculated as beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let me compute (m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 = 11.6281 (GeV^2).

E² = 27² = 729 (GeV^2).

So (m c²)^2 / E^2 = 11.6281 / 729 ≈ 0.01596.

So 1 -0.01596 =0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404) = approximately 0.992016.

So beta c is 0.992016 *3e8 m/s = 2.976048e8 m/s.

So L_avg = beta c * tau =2.976048e8 *6.33432e-15.

Compute 2.976048e8 *6.33432e-15 = 2.976048 *6.33432 *1e-7.

2.976048 *6.33432:

Compute 2 *6.33432=12.66864.

0.976048 *6.33432.

Compute 0.9 *6.33432=5.700888.

0.07 *6.33432=0.4434024.

0.006048 *6.33432≈0.0382 (exact: 0.006048 *6.33432=0.03821).

So 5.700888 +0.4434024=6.1442904 +0.03821=6.1825004.

Total: 12.66864 +6.1825004=18.8511404.

So 18.8511404e-7 m =1.885114e-6 m.

Still the same as before.

Looking back at the options, A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% larger than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, what's the question again? The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's the length L where P=30%.

Wait, maybe I need to compute L such that the probability is 30%, which is L = L_avg * ln(1/ (1-0.3)) = L_avg * ln(10/7) = L_avg * 0.35667.

So with L_avg as 1.885e-6 m, L=0.35667 *1.885e-6 = approx 0.67e-6 m.

But that's 6.7e-7 m, which is 670 nm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, which is L_avg.

If so, then the mean is about 1.88e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest is A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). But perhaps I forgot that E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. So yes, gamma = E/(m c²) is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay length is the speed multiplied by the lifetime, not considering gamma. No, wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. So decay length is v gamma tau_0.

Wait, v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is (beta gamma) c tau_0.

But beta gamma = gamma beta.

Wait, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute beta gamma.

Alternatively, beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma.

Which is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/E^2) * (E/(m c^2)).

Let me compute beta gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2/(E^2)).

So beta gamma = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) * (E/(m c^2)).

Simplify:

= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) * (E/(m c^2)).

= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / E ) * (E/(m c^2)).

= sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / (m c^2).

So beta gamma = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV / (3.41 GeV c^2/c^2) ) ?

Wait, because E is in GeV, and m c^2 is GeV. So units-wise:

sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) is in GeV, divided by (m c^2) which is GeV, so unitless.

So beta gamma = sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) /3.41.

Compute 27^2 =729, 3.41^2=11.6281.

So 729 -11.6281=717.3719.

sqrt(717.3719)=approx 26.784.

So beta gamma=26.784 /3.41≈7.854.

So beta gamma is approximately 7.854.

Then, L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.854 *3=23.562.

23.562e8 *8e-16 = (23.562 *8 )e-8 = 188.496e-8 = 1.88496e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.885e-6 meters. Again, same as before.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the mean decay length but about the minimum distance the chamber can resolve. Maybe the chamber's resolution is the minimum distance it can detect, so to detect a decay, the decay must occur within that distance. So to have 30% observed, perhaps the length needs to be the mean decay length multiplied by some factor.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L_avg as 1.885e-6 m. The options don't have that, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 10% higher.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact values.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma =27 /3.41 = let's compute this precisely.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.9179.

So 7.9179.

Tau=gamma *tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=63.343e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

m=3.41, E=27.

So m²=11.6281, E²=729.

m²/E²=0.01596.

1 -0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.992016.

So beta=0.992016.

c=3e8 m/s.

So beta c=0.992016 *3e8=2.976048e8 m/s.

L_avg=beta c * tau=2.976048e8 *6.3343e-15.

Calculate 2.976048e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.976048 *6.3343) *1e-7.

Compute 2 *6.3343 =12.6686.

0.976048 *6.3343.

0.9 *6.3343=5.70087.

0.07 *6.3343=0.443401.

0.006048 *6.3343≈0.0382.

Total:5.70087 +0.443401=6.144271 +0.0382=6.182471.

So 2 *6.3343=12.6686 +6.182471=18.851071.

So 18.851071e-7 m=1.8851071e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the mean decay length without considering the 30% probability. But the question specifically says "at least 30% of the decays."

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using speed as c (beta=1) instead of the exact value. Let me recalculate L_avg assuming beta=1.

If beta=1, L_avg= c * tau =3e8 m/s *6.3343e-15 s =1.90029e-6 m ≈1.9e-6 m.

But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the calculation to be done using relativistic gamma, but perhaps I should have used the momentum or something else.

Wait, another approach: The time available in the lab frame is t' = gamma tau_0.

The distance traveled is v t' = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is the same as L_avg.

So using that formula, we have L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

As before, beta gamma we found to be approximately 7.854.

So L_avg =7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that:

7.854 *3e8 = 2.3562e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3562e9 *8e-16 = 18.8496e-7 m =1.88496e-6 m.

Same as before.

So I think my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the resolution refers to the energy resolution, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps 'resolution' refers to the ability to distinguish two particles, which would be related to the distance they travel. So perhaps the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, which is the distance over which the decay must occur for the chamber to detect it. So if the decay length is L, the chamber's resolution must be at least L so that the decay can be observed.

In that case, the minimal resolution is the decay length L, which is about 1.885e-6 m. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think about using the speed as a fraction of c. Maybe the question is looking for the distance L where 30% of the particles decay within that length. So using the formula I have, L = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

So L = L_avg * ln(10/7) ≈ L_avg * 0.3567.

But given that L_avg is about 1.885e-6 m, L would be approximately 0.3567 *1.885e-6 ≈ 0.67e-6 m.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should express the problem in terms of the lab frame lifetime. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau_0.

The average path length is beta c gamma tau_0.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the velocity in terms of the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using beta = p c² / E, where p is momentum.

But again, E = gamma m c², p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = (p c) / E.

But without knowing p, perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, the momentum p can be found via E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(27² -3.41²) GeV.

Which is sqrt(729 -11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) ≈26.784 GeV.

So p c =26.784 GeV.

Thus, beta = (p c)/E =26.784 /27≈0.9920, same as before.

So I'm back to where I started.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the speed as v = c, which gives L =c * gamma tau0.

So gamma is 7.9179, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.9179=2.37537e9.

Multiply by8e-16: 2.37537e9 *8e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

Which is 1.90e-6 m.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper lifetime is given as tau_0, and the observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0.

The average distance is then beta c gamma tau_0, which is v gamma tau_0.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the lab frame.

The proper lifetime is tau_0, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

The average distance is v * gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is what I've been doing.

So, considering all this, I'm getting about 1.885e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27/3.41.

Compute 27 divided by3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= approximately 0.9179.

So 7.9179.

But perhaps using a calculator, 27/3.41 is approximately 7.9178.

So earlier calculations are correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the minimum distance such that the probability is 30%, which is the L I calculated as about 0.67e-6 m. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D)2.08e-3 m

Hmm. Only option A is in the micro meters range.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values without approximation.

Compute L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Let me compute each part precisely.

beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2 =11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01596.

1-0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.992016.

gamma=27/3.41=7.917841935.

So beta * gamma=0.992016 *7.917841935.

Compute 0.992016 *7=6.944112.

0.992016 *0.917841935≈0.9095.

So total beta gamma≈6.944112 +0.9095≈7.8536.

So beta gamma ≈7.8536.

Now, c=2.99792e8 m/s (using more precise value).

But let's use 3e8 for simplicity.

Tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0=7.8536 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.8536 *3=23.5608.

23.5608 *8=188.4864.

So 188.4864e-8 m =1.884864e-6 m, which is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

Again, same result.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the lab frame time without considering that the lifetime is already dilated.

Wait, if I mistakenly used tau_0 instead of tau in the calculation, that would change things.

Wait, let's say I forgot to multiply by gamma.

Then, L = beta c tau_0=0.992 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 0.992 *3=2.976.

2.976e8 *8e-16=2.976 *8=23.808e-8=2.3808e-7 m.

Which is 0.238e-6 m, 2.38e-7 m, which is even smaller than our previous calculation, so that's not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the decay length without using gamma, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the momentum or something else, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum energy resolution, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum length that can be resolved, which is the decay length multiplied by 30%, but even then, 0.3 *1.885e-6 is 5.655e-7, which isn't an option.

I'm stuck here. The only option that's in the same order of magnitude is option A, 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps that's the intended answer, and I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma =27/3.41.

Compute 3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= let's compute 3.13 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×0.917=3.127.

So 0.917.

So gamma=7.917.

So, L_avg=beta gamma c tau_0.

Beta gamma is 0.992 *7.917=7.853.

So,7.853 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.853 *3e8 *8e-16.

=7.853 *24e-8.

=188.472e-8 m=1.88472e-6 m.

Same as before.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of beta.

Wait, beta = (pc)/(E), where p is the momentum.

p= sqrt(E^2 -m^2 c^4)/c.

So, p c = sqrt(27² -3.41²)= sqrt(729-11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.784 GeV.

So, p c =26.784 GeV.

So beta = (pc)/E =26.784 /27=0.992009.

So beta=0.992009.

So, beta *gamma =0.992009 *7.9178= let's compute that.

0.992009 *7=6.944063.

0.992009 *0.9178=approx 0.9095 (since 0.9178 is about 0.9178).

So total beta gamma=6.944063+0.9095≈7.85356.

So same as before.

Thus, L=7.85356 *3e8 *8e-16=7.85356*24e-8=188.48544e-8 m=1.8848544e-6 m.

So, same result.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Maybe the correct answer is A) 2.08e-6 m, but I don't understand why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the gamma is calculated using E²=(pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) =27/(3.41)=7.9178.

But perhaps the calculation of beta is different.

Wait, another formula: beta = (pc)/(E).

As we saw, pc=26.784 GeV, so beta=26.784/27=0.992009.

So all correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting the answer to be option A, 2.08e-6 m, perhaps because in the calculation, they used more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta gamma more precisely.

beta gamma = (v/c)*gamma.

Which is (sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2))) * (E/(m c²)).

= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) )/(m c^2).

Which is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / (m c²).

So, sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) = sqrt(717.3719)=26.784 GeV.

So beta gamma=26.784 GeV /3.41 GeV=7.854.

So, L= beta gamma c tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.854 *3e8 *8e-16=7.854 *24e-8=188.496e-8 m=1.88496e-6 m.

So, 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, such as 3e8 m/s exactly.

But that wouldn't change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything with more precise numbers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the lab frame time as tau_0 instead of gamma tau_0. But that wouldn't make sense because the lifetime is longer in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mean lifetime, but I think I did that.

Wait, unless the problem is considering the probability that the particle decays within its own lifetime, but that would be P=1 -e^{-1}≈0.63, which is over 60%.

But the question is about 30% so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum distance such that at least 30% decay within that distance, which requires L = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3))=L_avg *0.3567.

So, 1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.7e-7 m, which isn't an option.

I'm really stuck. I think perhaps I should choose the closest option, which is option A, 2.08e-6 m. But I don't see how that would arise from the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses a different approach, such as considering the momentum.

Wait, another formula: The decay length is (gamma beta c tau_0), which is same as beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum distance in the lab frame, but I don't see how that changes anything.

At this point, I think the only option that is in the correct order of magnitude is option A, 2.08e-6 m, so perhaps that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ + Z^- \). The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy of the particle in the bubble chamber is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), with a mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Relativistic Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:
   Using the formula \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \), where \( E \) is the total energy and \( m c^2 \) is the rest energy:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178
   \]

2. **Lifetime in the Lab Frame (\( \tau \))**:
   The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.9178 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} = 6.33424 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Velocity (\( \beta c \))**:
   The velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light is:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(m c^2)^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{27^2}} \approx 0.992016
   \]
   Thus, \( \beta c \approx 0.992016 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.976048 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Mean Decay Length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \))**:
   The mean decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau = (2.976048 \times 10^8) \times (6.33424 \times 10^{-15}) \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

5. **Decay Length for 30% Probability**:
   The probability of a decay occurring within a distance \( L \) is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   For \( P = 0.3 \), we solve for \( L \):
   \[
   L = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right) \approx L_{\text{avg}} \cdot 0.35667
   \]
   Substituting \( L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   L \approx 0.35667 \cdot 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated decay length for 30% of the decays is approximately \( 6.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which is larger than the calculated mean decay length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)) but may reflect a different interpretation or approximation in the problem setup.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the minimum resolution. I think resolution in this context refers to the ability to distinguish particles, maybe the distance over which the decay products can be detected. So perhaps it's about the minimum distance the decay can be observed, which depends on the lifetime and the speed of the particle.

So, I remember that the lifetime of a moving particle is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But how does that apply here?

The Lorentz factor γ is given by E/(m c²), right? Because relativistic energy E is γ m c². So since E is given, and the mass m is given, I can find γ.

Wait, E is the total energy, which is 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So γ = E / (m c²). But since both are in GeV, the units might work out. Let me calculate that.

So γ = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.918. So approximately 7.92.

Then, the lifetime τ = γ τ₀ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.92 * 8 is about 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s. Wait, 7.92 *8e-16 is 63.36e-16? Or 6.336e-15? Wait, no, 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so 63.36 ×1e-16 s = 6.336 ×1e-15 seconds.

Wait, I think I should be precise. 7.92 multiplied by 8e-16 is 63.36e-16, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part. The decay length is how far the particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is v * τ, where v is the velocity.

But wait, v can be found from the energy. Alternatively, since we have γ, and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), perhaps we can find v in terms of γ.

Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, but maybe it's easier to find beta, β = v/c.

Hmm, beta is v/c. So, from E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². And p = gamma m v. So, E² = (gamma² m² v² c²) + (gamma² m² c^4) (since m c² squared is m² c^4). Wait, maybe a different approach.

Wait, the relation between energy, mass, and beta is:

E = γ m c²

p = γ m v = γ m β c

So, beta can be found from β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let me compute that. Plugging in the numbers:

E =27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

So m² c^4 = (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2, and E² = (27)^2 (GeV)^2.

So, m² c^4 / E² = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - m² c^4/E² ≈ 0.98405.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

So β ≈ 0.992 c.

So v ≈ 0.992 c. Okay, but maybe I can be more precise.

Alternatively, since the total energy is E = γ m c², and γ is 7.92 as I found earlier, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, gamma is 7.92, so 1/gamma squared is 1/(7.92)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405, whose square root is about 0.992, as before. So beta is approximately 0.992.

So v is about 0.992c.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. So L = β c * τ.

So we have τ as 6.336e-15 s. Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.992 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.336e-15 s: 2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = ?

Let me compute 2.976 *6.336 ≈ let's see. 3 *6 is 18, 3 *0.336 is 1.008, 0.976 *6 is 5.856, etc. Maybe more accurately:

6.336 * 2.976 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 2.976 = 17.856. 0.336 *2.976 = about 1.000 (since 0.3 *3 is 0.9, plus 0.036*3=0.108, so 0.9 +0.108=1.008, but 0.336 is a bit more than 0.3, so maybe 1.000). So total around 18.856.

Wait, but 2.976 is approximately 3 - 0.024.

So 6.336 * (3 -0.024) = 6.336 *3 -6.336 *0.024.

6.336 *3 = 19.008.

6.336 *0.024 = 0.152064.

So 19.008 - 0.152064 = 18.855936.

So 6.336 *2.976 ≈18.856.

So 2.976e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) *1e8 * 1e-15 = 18.856 *1e-7 = 1.8856e-6 meters.

Wait, wait—because 1e8 times 1e-15 is 1e-7. So 18.856e-7 meters.

Which is 1.8856e-6 meters, or approximately 1.886e-6 meters.

Hmm. So L ≈ 1.886e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps I need to compute the distance such that 30% of the decays are observed, and find the required resolution.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the observed lifetime is longer because of time dilation, leading to longer decay length. The minimum resolution is the shortest distance the chamber can detect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps it's the length L such that 30% of the particles decay within that length. Or maybe it's the mean decay length, and the resolution needs to be such that at least 30% are within that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the decay length such that the probability of decaying within that length is 30%. So the decay follows an exponential probability.

Wait, the decay probability is P = 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where t is the time the particle is moving. But in this case, the distance L is what we're interested in.

But L = v t, so t = L / v.

So the probability P is 1 - e^{-L/(v τ)}.

Wait, but v is β c, and τ is γ τ₀.

Alternatively, since v = β c, and τ = γ τ₀, then L = β c τ.

Wait, but I'm trying to find L such that P = 30% (0.3) is the probability of decaying within that length.

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(β c τ)}.

So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(β c τ)}.

So e^{-L/(β c τ)} = 0.7.

Take natural log of both sides:

-L/(β c τ) = ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

Multiply both sides by -1:

L/(β c τ) = 0.35667.

So L = β c τ * 0.35667.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, the mean decay length is L_avg = β c τ.

So the probability of decaying within a distance L is P = 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}.

So if P = 0.3, then 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}, so e^{-L/L_avg} = 0.7, so L = - L_avg ln(0.7).

Which is L = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg * 0.35667.

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

Wait, but earlier I computed L_avg as about 1.886e-6 meters.

So 0.35667 * 1.886e-6 ≈ let's compute that.

1.886e-6 * 0.35667.

Hmm, 1.886 *0.35667 is about 0.67, so 0.67e-6 meters, or 6.7e-7 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Option B is 2.08e-9 m.

Option C is 2.08e-1 m.

Option D is 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, none of these is around 6.7e-7 m. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of L_avg. Let me recalculate.

Wait, earlier I found that τ = gamma tau_0 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s = 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 s.

Then, L_avg = beta c tau.

Beta is 0.992 c, so beta c is 0.992 c²? No, wait: beta c is 0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.

Wait, no, wait: beta is 0.992, so beta c is 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Compute that: 2.976e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) *1e-7.

Earlier, I calculated 2.976 *6.336 as about 18.856.

So 18.856e-7 m = 1.8856e-6 m, which is 1.886e-6 meters.

So L_avg is approximately 1.886e-6 m.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think we're looking for the decay length L such that the probability of decay within L is 30% (0.3).

So using the formula:

P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}.

We set P=0.3, so:

0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/L_avg}

e^{-L/L_avg} = 0.7

Take ln:

-L/L_avg = ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

Thus, L = 0.35667 * 1.886e-6 m ≈ 0.67e-6 m, which is 6.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta or gamma.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation.

E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 27/(3.41) ≈ 7.9178. So that's correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, (m c²) = 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV.

So (m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2.

E^2 = (27)^2 (GeV)^2.

So (m c²)^2 / E^2 = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2≈0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= 0.99202, as before.

So beta is about 0.992 c. That seems correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is that I need to compute the minimum distance so that at least 30% of the particles decay within that distance.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the resolution of the chamber, which is the length that can be distinguished, so the minimum distance that the decay products are separated. So perhaps the minimum length that can be observed is the decay length, so the resolution should be at least as large as the decay length, so that the decay can be detected.

Wait, but then the problem is just to compute the decay length, which is L_avg. But earlier I found that L_avg is approximately 1.886e-6 m. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. Hmm, maybe I made a precise calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate L_avg more accurately.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 = exact value.

27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *7.9= 27.059. So 7.9 is 3.41 *7.9= 27.059, which is a bit over 27. So 27 /3.41 = approximately 7.917.

So gamma is 7.9178.

So tau = gamma * tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So 7.9178 *8e-16 = 63.3424e-16 s =6.33424e-15 s.

Now, beta c is 0.992 *3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.

So L_avg = beta c * tau = 2.976e8 m/s *6.33424e-15 s.

Multiply 2.976e8 by6.33424e-15.

2.976 *6.33424 = let's calculate.

2 *6.33424=12.66848.

0.976 *6.33424.

0.9*6.33424=5.700816.

0.07*6.33424=0.4433968.

0.006 *6.33424=0.03800544.

Add: 5.700816 + 0.4433968=6.1442128 +0.03800544=6.1822182.

So total 12.66848 +6.1822182=18.8506982.

So 18.8506982e-7 m = 1.88506982e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.885e-6 meters.

So L_avg is about 1.885e-6 m.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the minimum resolution is the length L such that 30% of decays occur within L. So I need to find L where P=0.3.

Earlier, I found L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

So 0.35667 *1.885e-6 ≈ 0.67e-6 m, 6.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the P equation. Let me think again. The decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability that the decay occurs before time t is P = 1 - e^{-t/tau}. But in terms of distance, t = L/(beta c), so P =1 -e^{-L/(beta c tau)}.

Wait, beta c tau is L_avg.

So P =1 - e^{-L / L_avg}.

Which is what I had before. So with P=0.3, L = L_avg * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, ln(1/(0.7)) is ln(10/7) ≈ 0.35667.

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

So 0.35667 *1.885e-6 = approximately 0.67e-6 meters.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is asking for the L_avg, which is about 1.885e-6 m. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 = let's compute precisely.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = approximately 0.9179.

So 7.9179. So gamma is 7.9179.

Tau=gamma * tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=63.3432e-16=6.33432e-15 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E²)).

Compute m/E =3.41/27=0.126296.

So (m/E)^2=0.015949.

So 1 -0.015949=0.984051.

sqrt(0.984051)=approx 0.991997.

So beta c =0.991997 *3e8 m/s=2.97599e8 m/s.

So L_avg= beta c * tau=2.97599e8 *6.33432e-15.

Compute 2.97599e8 *6.33432e-15.

Multiply 2.97599 *6.33432= let's calculate.

2 *6.33432=12.66864.

0.97599 *6.33432.

Compute 0.9 *6.33432=5.700888.

0.07 *6.33432=0.4434024.

0.00599*6.33432≈0.03784.

Total:5.700888 +0.4434024=6.1442904 +0.03784=6.1821304.

So total 12.66864 +6.1821304=18.8507704.

So 18.8507704e-7 m =1.885077e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So L_avg is 1.885e-6 meters, but none of the options is that. The closest is A: 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, gamma = E/(m c²). Since E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV, gamma is 27/3.41 = approximately 7.9178.

Wait another thought: How precise is the calculation? The options are given as 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08e-6. If I see my L_avg as 1.885e-6, perhaps that's 1.885e-6, which is approximately 2e-6. But the option is 2.08e-6, which is about 20% larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise beta.

Wait, the exact value of beta can be calculated as beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let me compute (m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 = 11.6281 (GeV^2).

E² = 27² = 729 (GeV^2).

So (m c²)^2 / E^2 = 11.6281 / 729 ≈ 0.01596.

So 1 -0.01596 =0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404) = approximately 0.992016.

So beta c is 0.992016 *3e8 m/s = 2.976048e8 m/s.

So L_avg = beta c * tau =2.976048e8 *6.33432e-15.

Compute 2.976048e8 *6.33432e-15 = 2.976048 *6.33432 *1e-7.

2.976048 *6.33432:

Compute 2 *6.33432=12.66864.

0.976048 *6.33432.

Compute 0.9 *6.33432=5.700888.

0.07 *6.33432=0.4434024.

0.006048 *6.33432≈0.0382 (exact: 0.006048 *6.33432=0.03821).

So 5.700888 +0.4434024=6.1442904 +0.03821=6.1825004.

Total: 12.66864 +6.1825004=18.8511404.

So 18.8511404e-7 m =1.885114e-6 m.

Still the same as before.

Looking back at the options, A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% larger than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, what's the question again? The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's the length L where P=30%.

Wait, maybe I need to compute L such that the probability is 30%, which is L = L_avg * ln(1/ (1-0.3)) = L_avg * ln(10/7) = L_avg * 0.35667.

So with L_avg as 1.885e-6 m, L=0.35667 *1.885e-6 = approx 0.67e-6 m.

But that's 6.7e-7 m, which is 670 nm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, which is L_avg.

If so, then the mean is about 1.88e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest is A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). But perhaps I forgot that E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. So yes, gamma = E/(m c²) is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay length is the speed multiplied by the lifetime, not considering gamma. No, wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. So decay length is v gamma tau_0.

Wait, v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is (beta gamma) c tau_0.

But beta gamma = gamma beta.

Wait, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute beta gamma.

Alternatively, beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma.

Which is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/E^2) * (E/(m c^2)).

Let me compute beta gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2/(E^2)).

So beta gamma = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) * (E/(m c^2)).

Simplify:

= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) * (E/(m c^2)).

= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / E ) * (E/(m c^2)).

= sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / (m c^2).

So beta gamma = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV / (3.41 GeV c^2/c^2) ) ?

Wait, because E is in GeV, and m c^2 is GeV. So units-wise:

sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) is in GeV, divided by (m c^2) which is GeV, so unitless.

So beta gamma = sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) /3.41.

Compute 27^2 =729, 3.41^2=11.6281.

So 729 -11.6281=717.3719.

sqrt(717.3719)=approx 26.784.

So beta gamma=26.784 /3.41≈7.854.

So beta gamma is approximately 7.854.

Then, L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.854 *3=23.562.

23.562e8 *8e-16 = (23.562 *8 )e-8 = 188.496e-8 = 1.88496e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.885e-6 meters. Again, same as before.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the mean decay length but about the minimum distance the chamber can resolve. Maybe the chamber's resolution is the minimum distance it can detect, so to detect a decay, the decay must occur within that distance. So to have 30% observed, perhaps the length needs to be the mean decay length multiplied by some factor.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L_avg as 1.885e-6 m. The options don't have that, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 10% higher.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact values.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma =27 /3.41 = let's compute this precisely.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.9179.

So 7.9179.

Tau=gamma *tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=63.343e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

m=3.41, E=27.

So m²=11.6281, E²=729.

m²/E²=0.01596.

1 -0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.992016.

So beta=0.992016.

c=3e8 m/s.

So beta c=0.992016 *3e8=2.976048e8 m/s.

L_avg=beta c * tau=2.976048e8 *6.3343e-15.

Calculate 2.976048e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.976048 *6.3343) *1e-7.

Compute 2 *6.3343 =12.6686.

0.976048 *6.3343.

0.9 *6.3343=5.70087.

0.07 *6.3343=0.443401.

0.006048 *6.3343≈0.0382.

Total:5.70087 +0.443401=6.144271 +0.0382=6.182471.

So 2 *6.3343=12.6686 +6.182471=18.851071.

So 18.851071e-7 m=1.8851071e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the mean decay length without considering the 30% probability. But the question specifically says "at least 30% of the decays."

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using speed as c (beta=1) instead of the exact value. Let me recalculate L_avg assuming beta=1.

If beta=1, L_avg= c * tau =3e8 m/s *6.3343e-15 s =1.90029e-6 m ≈1.9e-6 m.

But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the calculation to be done using relativistic gamma, but perhaps I should have used the momentum or something else.

Wait, another approach: The time available in the lab frame is t' = gamma tau_0.

The distance traveled is v t' = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is the same as L_avg.

So using that formula, we have L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

As before, beta gamma we found to be approximately 7.854.

So L_avg =7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that:

7.854 *3e8 = 2.3562e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3562e9 *8e-16 = 18.8496e-7 m =1.88496e-6 m.

Same as before.

So I think my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the resolution refers to the energy resolution, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps 'resolution' refers to the ability to distinguish two particles, which would be related to the distance they travel. So perhaps the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, which is the distance over which the decay must occur for the chamber to detect it. So if the decay length is L, the chamber's resolution must be at least L so that the decay can be observed.

In that case, the minimal resolution is the decay length L, which is about 1.885e-6 m. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think about using the speed as a fraction of c. Maybe the question is looking for the distance L where 30% of the particles decay within that length. So using the formula I have, L = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

So L = L_avg * ln(10/7) ≈ L_avg * 0.3567.

But given that L_avg is about 1.885e-6 m, L would be approximately 0.3567 *1.885e-6 ≈ 0.67e-6 m.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should express the problem in terms of the lab frame lifetime. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau_0.

The average path length is beta c gamma tau_0.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the velocity in terms of the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using beta = p c² / E, where p is momentum.

But again, E = gamma m c², p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = (p c) / E.

But without knowing p, perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, the momentum p can be found via E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(27² -3.41²) GeV.

Which is sqrt(729 -11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) ≈26.784 GeV.

So p c =26.784 GeV.

Thus, beta = (p c)/E =26.784 /27≈0.9920, same as before.

So I'm back to where I started.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the speed as v = c, which gives L =c * gamma tau0.

So gamma is 7.9179, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.9179=2.37537e9.

Multiply by8e-16: 2.37537e9 *8e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

Which is 1.90e-6 m.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper lifetime is given as tau_0, and the observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0.

The average distance is then beta c gamma tau_0, which is v gamma tau_0.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the lab frame.

The proper lifetime is tau_0, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

The average distance is v * gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is what I've been doing.

So, considering all this, I'm getting about 1.885e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27/3.41.

Compute 27 divided by3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= approximately 0.9179.

So 7.9179.

But perhaps using a calculator, 27/3.41 is approximately 7.9178.

So earlier calculations are correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the minimum distance such that the probability is 30%, which is the L I calculated as about 0.67e-6 m. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D)2.08e-3 m

Hmm. Only option A is in the micro meters range.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values without approximation.

Compute L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Let me compute each part precisely.

beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2 =11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01596.

1-0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.992016.

gamma=27/3.41=7.917841935.

So beta * gamma=0.992016 *7.917841935.

Compute 0.992016 *7=6.944112.

0.992016 *0.917841935≈0.9095.

So total beta gamma≈6.944112 +0.9095≈7.8536.

So beta gamma ≈7.8536.

Now, c=2.99792e8 m/s (using more precise value).

But let's use 3e8 for simplicity.

Tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0=7.8536 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.8536 *3=23.5608.

23.5608 *8=188.4864.

So 188.4864e-8 m =1.884864e-6 m, which is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

Again, same result.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the lab frame time without considering that the lifetime is already dilated.

Wait, if I mistakenly used tau_0 instead of tau in the calculation, that would change things.

Wait, let's say I forgot to multiply by gamma.

Then, L = beta c tau_0=0.992 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 0.992 *3=2.976.

2.976e8 *8e-16=2.976 *8=23.808e-8=2.3808e-7 m.

Which is 0.238e-6 m, 2.38e-7 m, which is even smaller than our previous calculation, so that's not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the decay length without using gamma, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the momentum or something else, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum energy resolution, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum length that can be resolved, which is the decay length multiplied by 30%, but even then, 0.3 *1.885e-6 is 5.655e-7, which isn't an option.

I'm stuck here. The only option that's in the same order of magnitude is option A, 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps that's the intended answer, and I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma =27/3.41.

Compute 3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= let's compute 3.13 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×0.917=3.127.

So 0.917.

So gamma=7.917.

So, L_avg=beta gamma c tau_0.

Beta gamma is 0.992 *7.917=7.853.

So,7.853 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.853 *3e8 *8e-16.

=7.853 *24e-8.

=188.472e-8 m=1.88472e-6 m.

Same as before.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of beta.

Wait, beta = (pc)/(E), where p is the momentum.

p= sqrt(E^2 -m^2 c^4)/c.

So, p c = sqrt(27² -3.41²)= sqrt(729-11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.784 GeV.

So, p c =26.784 GeV.

So beta = (pc)/E =26.784 /27=0.992009.

So beta=0.992009.

So, beta *gamma =0.992009 *7.9178= let's compute that.

0.992009 *7=6.944063.

0.992009 *0.9178=approx 0.9095 (since 0.9178 is about 0.9178).

So total beta gamma=6.944063+0.9095≈7.85356.

So same as before.

Thus, L=7.85356 *3e8 *8e-16=7.85356*24e-8=188.48544e-8 m=1.8848544e-6 m.

So, same result.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Maybe the correct answer is A) 2.08e-6 m, but I don't understand why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the gamma is calculated using E²=(pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) =27/(3.41)=7.9178.

But perhaps the calculation of beta is different.

Wait, another formula: beta = (pc)/(E).

As we saw, pc=26.784 GeV, so beta=26.784/27=0.992009.

So all correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting the answer to be option A, 2.08e-6 m, perhaps because in the calculation, they used more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta gamma more precisely.

beta gamma = (v/c)*gamma.

Which is (sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2))) * (E/(m c²)).

= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) )/(m c^2).

Which is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / (m c²).

So, sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) = sqrt(717.3719)=26.784 GeV.

So beta gamma=26.784 GeV /3.41 GeV=7.854.

So, L= beta gamma c tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.854 *3e8 *8e-16=7.854 *24e-8=188.496e-8 m=1.88496e-6 m.

So, 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, such as 3e8 m/s exactly.

But that wouldn't change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything with more precise numbers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the lab frame time as tau_0 instead of gamma tau_0. But that wouldn't make sense because the lifetime is longer in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mean lifetime, but I think I did that.

Wait, unless the problem is considering the probability that the particle decays within its own lifetime, but that would be P=1 -e^{-1}≈0.63, which is over 60%.

But the question is about 30% so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum distance such that at least 30% decay within that distance, which requires L = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3))=L_avg *0.3567.

So, 1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.7e-7 m, which isn't an option.

I'm really stuck. I think perhaps I should choose the closest option, which is option A, 2.08e-6 m. But I don't see how that would arise from the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses a different approach, such as considering the momentum.

Wait, another formula: The decay length is (gamma beta c tau_0), which is same as beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum distance in the lab frame, but I don't see how that changes anything.

At this point, I think the only option that is in the correct order of magnitude is option A, 2.08e-6 m, so perhaps that's the intended answer.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ + Z^- \). The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy of the particle in the bubble chamber is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), with a mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Relativistic Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:
   Using the formula \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \), where \( E \) is the total energy and \( m c^2 \) is the rest energy:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178
   \]

2. **Lifetime in the Lab Frame (\( \tau \))**:
   The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.9178 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} = 6.33424 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Velocity (\( \beta c \))**:
   The velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light is:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(m c^2)^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{27^2}} \approx 0.992016
   \]
   Thus, \( \beta c \approx 0.992016 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.976048 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Mean Decay Length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \))**:
   The mean decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau = (2.976048 \times 10^8) \times (6.33424 \times 10^{-15}) \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

5. **Decay Length for 30% Probability**:
   The probability of a decay occurring within a distance \( L \) is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   For \( P = 0.3 \), we solve for \( L \):
   \[
   L = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right) \approx L_{\text{avg}} \cdot 0.35667
   \]
   Substituting \( L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   L \approx 0.35667 \cdot 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated decay length for 30% of the decays is approximately \( 6.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which is larger than the calculated mean decay length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)) but may reflect a different interpretation or approximation in the problem setup.
