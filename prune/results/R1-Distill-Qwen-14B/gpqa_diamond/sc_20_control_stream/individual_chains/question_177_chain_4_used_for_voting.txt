Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read it again and take notes.

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, but I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

Then, through spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, that would mean their temperatures are the same, right? Because lambda is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's a key point.

The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. But in this case, since the peak wavelengths are the same as observed, does the radial velocity affect the calculated temperature? Hmm, maybe. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted. So the observed wavelength would be shorter than the actual emitted one. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps we have to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating their temperatures.

Wait, no. Let me think. The observed wavelength is what they measure. So for Star_2, because it's moving towards us at 700 km/s, its emitted wavelength (which is determined by its temperature) would be blueshifted. So the observed lambda would be shorter than the rest lambda. But in the problem, both stars' observed lambda are the same. So maybe the actual emitted wavelengths are different, but due to their velocities, they appear the same.

Alternatively, perhaps when they compute the luminosity, they correct for the Doppler shift. Because luminosity as seen from Earth is affected by the star's velocity. Wait, but when we calculate the intrinsic properties of a star, like its luminosity, we have to consider its rest frame. So maybe the radial velocity affects the observed temperature.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

But since we're assuming the stars radiate as blackbodies, that's the formula we'll use.

Now, the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the observed wavelengths are λ1_obs and λ2_obs, which are equal.

But the actual emitted wavelengths depend on the star's temperature and velocity. Because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (assuming v is much smaller than c, maybe we can approximate with a simpler formula, like λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r/c) )? Wait, wait, the Doppler shift formula for light is a bit more precise. The relativistic Doppler shift is given by λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but when v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated by λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r/c) ), assuming v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, I think).

But wait, in this case, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. Star_2 has v_r =700 km/s. Let me think about the sign. If Star_2 is moving towards us (v_r is negative, I think, because it's moving towards the observer), then λ_obs would be shorter than emitted. Oh, because as the source moves towards you, the wavelength is blueshifted (shorter). So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted λ is longer (so higher temperature?), but observed λ is shorter.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, Star_2's velocity is positive 700 km/s. Wait, what's the sign convention here? The radial velocity is given as 700 km/s for Star_2. But if the radial velocity is positive when moving away, then Star_2 is moving away. So the Doppler shift would cause λ_obs to be longer than the emitted λ. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, so Star_1 is stationary, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. Star_2 is moving away with v_r =700 km/s, so λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, if it's moving away, v_r is positive, so the observed wavelength is longer. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/(c)) ) approximately, for small v_r.

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, we have:

λ1_emit = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is positive for moving away.

Wait, let me correct the Doppler formula. The non-relativistic Doppler shift is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c )

where v_r is the radial velocity component towards the observer. If the star is moving away (v_r positive), the wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards (v_r negative), the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

So for Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, if it's moving away, then:

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But wait, c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700e3 /3e5 = 700/300,000 = 0.002333... So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333. So λ2_obs ≈ λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But the observed wavelengths are same as Star_1, so λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

So from Star_1, since it's emitting λ1_emit, and Star_2's emission is λ2_emit, their emitted wavelengths are related by λ1_emit = 1.002333 * λ2_emit.

But according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So from λ1_emit = 1.002333 * λ2_emit,

(b / T1) = 1.002333 * (b / T2 )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = 1.002333 / T2

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, that would mean T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Wait, that's a small difference. Let me compute 1.002333: that's approximately 1 + (700e3)/(3e5e3) ) = 1 + 700/(3e5) ) ≈ 1.002333.

But wait, if Star_2 is moving away, that would make λ2_obs higher, but in our case, the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength must be shorter, because when you redshift it, the observed is the same as Star_1's. So Star_2's λ_emit must be shorter than Star_1's λ_emit. Because when you multiply by 1.002333, you get the same as Star_1's λ_emit. So that would mean λ2_emit = λ1_emit / 1.002333.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write the equations again.

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since its velocity is zero).

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v_r2/c )

Since v_r2 is 700 km/s, positive (moving away), so 1 + v_r2/c = 1 + 700e3 / (3e5e3) ) = 1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333.

So λ2_emit ≈ λ1_emit / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667 * λ1_emit.

So the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is shorter than that of Star_1. Since λ is inversely proportional to temperature, T2 is higher than T1.

Wait no, because λ_emit is proportional to 1/T. So if λ2_emit < λ1_emit, then T2 > T1.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

We have λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1.002333) ≈ 0.997667 * λ1_emit.

So T2_emit = b / λ2_emit = b / (0.997667 λ1_emit) ) = (1/0.997667) * (b / λ1_emit ) ) = approx 1.002333 * T1.

So T2 is approximately 0.23% higher than T1.

But wait, the problem states that the stars appear to have the same brightness wavelength. So when they compute the luminosity, they must be using the intrinsic properties of the stars, not the observed. So when calculating luminosity, we have to use the actual radius and temperature of each star, not the observed. Because the observed properties are affected by Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed brightness maximum is the same, which factors in the Doppler shift. But for the purpose of calculating luminosity, the intrinsic T and R are needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame. Let's see.

Wait, the problem says, "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed. So the Doppler shift affects observed wavelengths, but when computing the actual luminosity, we use the actual radius and temperature.

So, from the observed data, we can find the actual temperature of each star.

Because, for Star_1: λ1_emit = λ1_obs (since v_r1 is 0).

For Star_2: λ2_emit = λ2_obs / (1 + v_r2 / c ), since the observed wavelength is longer (as Star_2 is moving away) than the emitted. So λ2_emit = λ1_obs / (1 + 700e3 /3e5e3) ) = λ1_emit / (1.002333).

So the temperatures are T1 = b / λ1_emit and T2 = b / λ2_emit = b / (λ1_emit / 1.002333) ) = (1.002333) * (b / λ1_emit) ) = 1.002333 * T1.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 is slightly higher.

Now, the luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1 = (R1)^2 * T1^4
L2 = (R2)^2 * T2^4

Because 4π and σ are constants and would cancel out when taking the ratio.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So let's compute L1 / L2.

L1/L2 = ( (R1² T1^4) ) / ( (R2² T2^4) ) )

Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = 1.002333 T1:

= ( ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) * T1^4 ) / ( (R2^2) * (1.002333 T1 )^4 ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ] / [ R2² * (1.002333^4 T1^4) ) ]

R2² cancels out, T1^4 cancels.

= 2.25 / (1.002333^4 )

Now compute 1.002333^4.

Let me calculate that. Let's compute (1.002333)^4.

We can approximate using the binomial expansion. Let x = 0.002333.

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4.

x ≈ 0.002333, so x² ≈ (0.002333)^2 ≈ 5.44e-6.

x³ ≈ (0.002333)^3 ≈ 1.27e-8.

x^4 ≈ (0.002333)^4 ≈ 3.19e-11.

So:

1 +4*(0.002333) = 1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Plus 6*(5.44e-6) = 3.264e-5. So 1.009332 + 0.00003264 = 1.00936464.

Plus 4*(1.27e-8) ≈ 5.08e-8. So 1.00936464 + 0.0000000508 = ~1.00936469.

Plus 3.19e-11 ≈ 0.0000000000319. So negligible.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.0093647.

Let me compute 1.0093647 ≈ 1.00936.

So 2.25 / 1.00936.

Let me compute 1.00936 * 2.228 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, let's do it step by step.

Compute 1.00936 * 2.228 = ?

2.228 *1 = 2.228.

2.228 * 0.00936 = approximately 0.02085.

Total ≈ 2.24885, which is close to 2.25. So 2.228 * 1.00936 ≈ 2.25.

So 2.25 /1.00936 ≈ 2.228.

So the factor is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the answer should be D) ~2.23.

But wait, let's recheck the calculations for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift part. Let me go back.

Wait, we have Star_2 moving away with velocity v =700 km/s. The Doppler shift formula for the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Since v_r is positive (moving away), λ_obs is longer than λ_emit.

But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

For Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since v_r=0).

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3/3e5e3) = λ2_emit * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 * λ2_emit.

So since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_emit = 1.002333 * λ2_emit.

So λ2_emit = λ1_emit / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667 * λ1_emit.

Thus, T2 = b / λ2_emit = (b / λ1_emit) * (1.002333) = T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 = 1.002333 T1.

So T2 is T1*(1+0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 T1.

So when we compute L1/L2, which is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We have R1 =1.5 R2, so R1² = 2.25 R2².

T2 = 1.002333 T1, so T2^4 = (1.002333)^4 T1^4 ≈ 1.00936 T1^4.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25 * T1^4 ) / ( T1^4 * 1.00936 ) ) = 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.228.

Which is about 2.23, so the factor is approximately 2.23. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{2.25 R_2^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{2.25 T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

Thus, the ratio depends on the fourth power of the temperature ratio.

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) of the two stars are the same. Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since it has no radial velocity (\(v_r = 0\)), the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{emit}}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) (moving away), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}\), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \cdot 1.002333
\]

From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), so:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 = 1.002333 \cdot T_1
\]

### Step 3: Substituting into the luminosity ratio
The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1.002333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^4 = (1.002333)^4
\]

Using the binomial approximation for small \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
(1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4
\]

Substituting \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00936
\]

Now, substitute into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.00936} \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
