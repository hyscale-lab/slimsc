Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pH calculations can get a bit tricky. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. The options are A to D, with some pH values.

Hmm, right. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, the first thing to do is figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions. The strong acids and bases will completely dissociate, so their contributions are straightforward. For weak acids, like acetic acid, we'll have to consider their dissociation as well.

Wait, but wait, when you mix a strong acid with a strong base, they should neutralize each other. But here we have a weak acid too. So the steps are probably: calculate moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂, then see which is in excess. Then calculate the concentration after mixing all the solutions, and find pH based on the excess H+ or OH-.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's find the moles contributed by each solution.

1. For CH3COOH: It's a weak acid, 0.1 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. HCl: Strong acid, completely dissociates. 0.2 M in 400 mL. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives one H+, so 0.08 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)₂: Strong base, each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles of Ba(OH)₂ are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each Ba(OH)₂ gives two OH-, so total OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when we mix H+ and OH-, they will neutralize each other. So the total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)₂.

So total H+ available: from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. Hmm, so maybe I should calculate the initial H+ from HCl, and then see how much of the OH- will react with it, and then what's left will react with the CH3COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate all the H+ and OH- in the solution, but considering that strong acids and bases completely dissociate, and the weak acid contributes some H+.

Wait, but when you mix solutions, the total volume changes. So perhaps I should first calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- before considering neutralization.

Wait, no, the way to approach this is:

- Calculate moles of H+ from strong acids (HCl).
- Calculate moles of OH- from strong bases (Ba(OH)₂).
- Subtract these to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.
- Then, account for the weak acid (CH3COOH) if any H+ is left after neutralization.

Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is that when you mix all these, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will react. The CH3COOH is a weak acid and will contribute some H+.

But wait, the Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it's going to release a lot of OH-.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources except the weak acid (since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully release H+ yet).
2. Calculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂.
3. Subtract OH- from H+ to see if you have excess H+ or OH-.
   a. If excess H+, then the solution is acidic. The remaining H+ will come from the excess and the dissociation of CH3COOH.
   b. If excess OH-, then the solution is basic. The excess OH- will determine the pH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is an acid, so if after neutralization, there's excess OH-, the CH3COOH would react with it. Or wait, does the CH3COOH dissociate before the neutralization? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:

- All strong acids and strong bases will fully dissociate. So HCl gives H+; Ba(OH)₂ gives OH-.

- The weak acid (CH3COOH) will dissociate a little, but we can't ignore it. So when we mix all the solutions, we first have to find the net H+ or OH- from the strong acid and base, and then see if the weak acid can contribute or if it's neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the right way is to:

- Calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

- Calculate the total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix them, H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10. Wait, negative, so that means OH- is in excess. So excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, that's the OH- from the base and H+ from the acid. So the Ba(OH)₂ provides more OH- than H+ from HCl. So the solution is basic. The excess OH- is 0.10 moles.

But wait, there's also the CH3COOH. So the CH3COOH will donate some H+ which will react with the OH-.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. So the OH- may partially neutralize the CH3COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will react with the CH3COOH, but since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it's not a strong enough source of H+ to neutralize all the OH-.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate total moles of H+ from strong acid (HCl): 0.08 mol.

2. Calculate total moles of OH- from strong base (Ba(OH)₂): 0.18 mol.

3. The OH- and H+ will react: OH- + H+ → H2O.

   So, the amount of OH- remaining after reaction is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

4. Now, the CH3COOH is a weak acid. It can donate H+ to react with the remaining OH-.

But how much H+ can CH3COOH provide? Because it's a weak acid, only a small fraction of it dissociates. However, if the OH- is in excess, perhaps the CH3COOH can donate some H+ to neutralize some of the OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. The CH3COOH is in solution with the excess OH-. So, the OH- will react with any available H+ from the CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't release a lot of H+ on its own. So, the OH- will deprotonate some of the CH3COOH, turning it into acetate ions (CH3COO^-), and producing water.

So, the reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH.

But how much CH3COOH do we have? We have 0.05 moles.

So, excess OH- is 0.10 moles. But we have only 0.05 moles of CH3COOH available. So the OH- will react with all of the CH3COOH, converting it into acetate ions, and the excess OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, after this reaction, the remaining moles of OH- are 0.05.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. So after step 3, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. Then, CH3COOH (0.05 moles) will donate 0.05 moles of H+, which will neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps when it reacts with OH-, it will completely deprotonate, because OH- is a strong base. So, yes, all the CH3COOH will be deprotonated.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of all the individual volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041666... M.

Then, since OH- concentration is known, we can find pOH, then pH.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ let me calculate that. 

Wait, 0.041666 is approximately 4.1666e-2. 

Log(4.1666e-2) is log(4.1666) + log(1e-2) → log(4.1666) is about 0.62 (since log(4)=0.60, log(4.1666) is around 0.62 because 10^0.62 ≈4.07), so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is about 1.38.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is pOH = -log[OH-]. So [OH-] is 0.041666..., so log(0.041666) is negative. Let's compute it accurately.

Wait, 0.041666... is 1/24. Let me compute log(1/24):

log(1/24) = log(1) - log(24) = 0 - log(24). 

We know that log(24) = log(2.4e1) = log(2.4) + 1. Log(2.4) is approximately 0.3802, so log(24) is 1.3802. So log(1/24) = -1.3802.

Thus, pOH = 1.3802. So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈12.6198.

Wait, but wait, that would make the pH around 12.62, which is option A. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, let me recount the steps.

1. Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)₂. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

4. Then, the CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with OH-: each CH3COOH donates 1 H+ per OH-.

So, 0.05 mol H+ from CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

Concentration [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈1.38.

pH =14 -1.38 =12.62.

So that's option A) 12.62.

Wait, but wait. What about the fact that CH3COOH is a weak acid and only partially dissociates? In the reaction with OH-, the OH- is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the CH3COOH completely, right? Because the OH- is a stronger base than the acetate ion's conjugate base. So all the CH3COOH would react with OH-.

So, yes, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH would neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, correct.

So the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH =1.38, pH=12.62.

So the answer is A.

But wait, let me check if any step was miscalculated.

Another way to think about it: the total moles.

H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18.

Net OH- after neutralization with HCl: 0.10.

Plus, CH3COOH (0.05 mol) gives 0.05 H+ → which neutralizes 0.05 of the OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.05.

Yes, correct.

Another thing to consider: the molarity of the solution.

Total volume = 500 +400 +300 =1200 mL =1.2 L.

So [OH-] =0.05 /1.2≈0.0416667.

pH is 12.62.

Yes, so option A is correct.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given acids and bases, considering their dissociation properties.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid)**:  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base)**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **CH₃COOH (weak acid)**:  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   CH₃COOH partially dissociates, contributing some H⁺ ions.

---

### Step 2: Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻
The H⁺ from HCl reacts with the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:
\[
\text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The weak acid CH₃COOH reacts with the remaining OH⁻:
\[
\text{OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH: } \, \text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
\]
Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), so all \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH.  
Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

---

### Step 4: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of OH⁻ is:
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]

The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Wait, perhaps the right way is to:

- Calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

- Calculate the total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix them, H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10. Wait, negative, so that means OH- is in excess. So excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, that's the OH- from the base and H+ from the acid. So the Ba(OH)₂ provides more OH- than H+ from HCl. So the solution is basic. The excess OH- is 0.10 moles.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate total moles of H+ from strong acid (HCl): 0.08 mol.

2. Calculate total moles of OH- from strong base (Ba(OH)₂): 0.18 mol.

3. The OH- and H+ will react: OH- + H+ → H2O.

   So, the amount of OH- remaining after reaction is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

4. Now, the CH3COOH is a weak acid. It can donate H+ to react with the remaining OH-.

But how much H+ can CH3COOH provide? Because it's a weak acid, only a small fraction of it dissociates. However, if the OH- is in excess, perhaps the CH3COOH can donate some H+ to neutralize some of the OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. The CH3COOH is in solution with the excess OH-. So, the OH- will react with any available H+ from the CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't release a lot of H+ on its own. So, the OH- will deprotonate some of the CH3COOH, turning it into acetate ions (CH3COO^-), and producing water.

So, the reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH.

But how much CH3COOH do we have? We have 0.05 moles.

So, excess OH- is 0.10 moles. But we have only 0.05 moles of CH3COOH available. So the OH- will react with all of the CH3COOH, converting it into acetate ions, and the excess OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, after this reaction, the remaining moles of OH- are 0.05.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. So after step 3, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. Then, CH3COOH (0.05 moles) will donate 0.05 moles of H+, which will neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps when it reacts with OH-, it will completely deprotonate, because OH- is a strong base. So, yes, all the CH3COOH will be deprotonated.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution is the sum of all the individual volumes: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041666... M.

Then, since OH- concentration is known, we can find pOH, then pH.

pOH = -log(0.041666...) ≈ let me calculate that. 

Wait, 0.041666 is approximately 4.1666e-2. 

Log(4.1666e-2) is log(4.1666) + log(1e-2) → log(4.1666) is about 0.62 (since log(4)=0.60, log(4.1666) is around 0.62 because 10^0.62 ≈4.07), so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is about 1.38.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is pOH = -log[OH-]. So [OH-] is 0.041666..., so log(0.041666) is negative. Let's compute it accurately.

Wait, 0.041666... is 1/24. Let me compute log(1/24):

log(1/24) = log(1) - log(24) = 0 - log(24). 

We know that log(24) = log(2.4e1) = log(2.4) + 1. Log(2.4) is approximately 0.3802, so log(24) is 1.3802. So log(1/24) = -1.3802.

Thus, pOH = 1.3802. So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈12.6198.

Wait, but wait, that would make the pH around 12.62, which is option A. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, let me recount the steps.

1. Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)₂. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

4. Then, the CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with OH-: each CH3COOH donates 1 H+ per OH-.

So, 0.05 mol H+ from CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

Concentration [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈1.38.

pH =14 -1.38 =12.62.

So that's option A) 12.62.

Wait, but wait. What about the fact that CH3COOH is a weak acid and only partially dissociates? In the reaction with OH-, the OH- is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the CH3COOH completely, right? Because the OH- is a stronger base than the acetate ion's conjugate base. So all the CH3COOH would react with OH-.

So, yes, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH would neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, correct.

So the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH =1.38, pH=12.62.

So the answer is A.

But wait, let me check if any step was miscalculated.

Another way to think about it: the total moles.

H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18.

Net OH- after neutralization with HCl: 0.10.

Plus, CH3COOH (0.05 mol) gives 0.05 H+ → which neutralizes 0.05 of the OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.05.

Yes, correct.

Another thing to consider: the molarity of the solution.

Total volume = 500 +400 +300 =1200 mL =1.2 L.

So [OH-] =0.05 /1.2≈0.0416667.

pH is 12.62.

Yes, so option A is correct.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given acids and bases, considering their dissociation properties.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid)**:  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base)**:  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **CH₃COOH (weak acid)**:  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   CH₃COOH partially dissociates, contributing some H⁺ ions.

### Step 2: Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻
The H⁺ from HCl reacts with the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:
\[
\text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The weak acid CH₃COOH reacts with the remaining OH⁻:
\[
\text{OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH: } \, \text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
\]
Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), so all \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH.  
Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 4: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of OH⁻ is:
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]

The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
