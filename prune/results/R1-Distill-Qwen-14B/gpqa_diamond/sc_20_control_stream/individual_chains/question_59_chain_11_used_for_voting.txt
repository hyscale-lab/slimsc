Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of acid-base calculations. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution that's made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that's a bit complicated because there are three acids and a base involved.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe the first thing to do is figure out how much acid and base we're dealing with overall.

Let me think: Both HCl and CH3COOH are acids. Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the excess H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

I should calculate the moles of each H+ and OH- first.

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate the moles for each solution.

For acetic acid:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So the [H+] from CH3COOH won't be as much as 0.05. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I can consider that yet because the HCl is a strong acid and will donate all its H+.

Wait, but maybe I should first consider the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; I think it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So let's compute the moles of H+ from HCl and moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong, H+ = 0.08 moles.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH-: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So OH- is in excess. How much excess?

OH- excess = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Wait, no, that would be if H+ is less than OH-. Hmm, wait, 0.08 H+ and 0.18 OH-.

So moles of H+ available: 0.08
Moles of OH-: 0.18.

H+ will be completely neutralized by 0.08 moles of OH-. So OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So after neutralizing HCl and Ba(OH)2, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. But wait, that's not the whole story because there's also the acetic acid in the solution.

Wait, the acetic acid will contribute H+ ions as well. So I need to consider that.

Wait, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. It dissociates as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. So some H+ will come from that.

But when OH- is present, it will react with any available H+ from acids. So let me think: first, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from HCl and any other H+ sources.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is going to react with the H+ from HCl first. So the initial OH- is 0.18 moles, H+ from HCl is 0.08. So after neutralizing, 0.10 moles of OH- remain.

Now, the remaining OH- will then react with any other acidic H+ sources present, like from acetic acid.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. The acetic acid, being weak, doesn't release as much H+.

But wait, when OH- is in excess, it will deprotonate anything it can. So the remaining OH- will neutralize the acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, but when you add a strong base, it can neutralize some of it. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So the reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the moles of acetic acid present are 0.05 moles. The moles of OH- left after reacting with HCl are 0.10.

So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH can react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after this reaction, how much OH- is left?

Initial OH- after HCl reaction: 0.10 moles.

OH- used to react with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, the total solution has this remaining OH-.

Wait, but wait, what about the volume? Because the total volume of the solution is the sum of all the individual volumes.

Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.041666... M.

Wait, but wait, no. Because after all the reactions, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is the negative log of [OH-], so pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the steps because that's option A) 12.62. But wait, I thought the pH would be basic because OH- is in excess.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the order of reactions.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

HCl is a strong acid: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes some H+. Let's calculate that later.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH-.

Total H+ available: 0.08 (from HCl) + [H+ from CH3COOH]
Total OH- available: 0.18

But since OH- is a strong base, it will neutralize H+ first.

So the OH- will react with H+ from HCl and then from CH3COOH.

So first, OH- neutralizes HCl's H+.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 → neutralized by 0.08 moles OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, this remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. The reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So 0.05 moles of OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So after that reaction, the OH- remaining is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So the total OH- in the solution is 0.05 moles.

Now, the total volume is 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 → which is option A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because when you mix a weak acid and a strong base, the base can neutralize some of the weak acid. But in this case, the base (OH-) comes from Ba(OH)2 which is strong, so it will react with the weak acid.

So the calculation seems correct. So the pH would be 12.62, which is option A.

But looking at the options, option A is 12.62, which aligns with our calculation.

Wait, but let me think about the initial steps again. Could I have made a mistake with the moles?

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 moles, each giving 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.

So H+ from HCl is 0.08, which neutralizes 0.08 moles OH-.

Leftover OH- is 0.10, which then neutralizes 0.05 moles CH3COOH (since 0.05 moles are available).

So leftover OH- is 0.05 moles. So [OH-] is 0.05/1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is about 1.38, so pH is about 12.62.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ neutralize the H⁺ ions from HCl:  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} + 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \to 0.08 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \to 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COO⁻} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

4. **Calculate [OH⁻] in the final solution:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     \[ [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \].

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log [\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option A.

pOH is about 1.38, so pH is about 12.62.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ neutralize the H⁺ ions from HCl:  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} + 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \to 0.08 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \to 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COO⁻} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

4. **Calculate [OH⁻] in the final solution:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     \[ [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \].

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log [\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
