Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means the ring has two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) that absorbs around 1700 cm-1. I remember that esters also have O-H stretches, but wait, no, wait—wait, no, actually, the ester's O is part of the carbonyl and an ether-like linkage. Oh, wait, wait, no, the O ester groups don't have acidic H like in carboxylic acids. So the FTIR shows an ester, so the structure must have one.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows six signals. So the molecule has six distinct proton environments. Let's break down the signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic H. So the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that give two different environments. Like para substitution would have only one set (if both substituents are same), but if they are ortho or meta, perhaps more signals. Wait, but this has two signals, so maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the ring Hs to split into two equivalent sets. For example, if the substituents are para and the same, the ring would have two equivalent Hs each, leading to a doublet or singlet. Hmm, but wait, in para substitution, if both substituents are the same, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: the Hs adjacent to substituents (ortho) and those opposite (para to substituent). Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic Hs would be in two environments. So, perhaps that's what's happening here.

2. Two signals for vinyl H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. So maybe there's an ester group in the structure. Wait, an ester has an oxygen connected to a carbonyl and an R group. The vinyl would be part of an ester's R group, perhaps.

Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R', so the R could be an alkyl group. If the R is a vinyl group, like maybe a substituted ethene (like CH2CH2O?), but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent on the aromatic ring is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent is something like a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2O-... Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes a vinyl, like an ethyl group with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Like, for example, the substituent is a group like CH2CH2-O-CO-R. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent, like maybe a phenyl ester or something else. Wait, maybe the substituent on the benzene is an ester group, such as O-CO-CH2CH3, but that's more like an ethyl ester. Hmm, but the NMR mentions vinyl Hs, which have protons on a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group that's part of a vinyl group. Like, perhaps the substituent is something like CH2CH2-O-CO-..., but that doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2COOR, but that's a ketone, not an ester. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, such as CH2=CHCOOR. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain, so maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOOR attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, then maybe the ring substituents are two ester groups or one. Wait, no, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. But wait, the FTIR shows ester groups, so perhaps one of the substituents is an ester. Or maybe both are esters? But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-O-R, but wait, that's a carbonate, not an ester. No, esters are R-O-CO-R'.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. But wait, that's more like a carbonate again. Hmm.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-CH2CH3, and the other substituent is something else. But then the aromatic Hs would have two signals, as in the case of a para substitution, perhaps.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR signals. The NMR has two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals, and two CH3 signals. So six signals in total. Let's consider that.

So the aromatic Hs: two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two distinct sets of Hs. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, and the ring is symmetrical, leading to two equivalent Hs in each set. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, but that might give more signals.

Wait, let's think about a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. No, wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. So if both substituents are in the para positions, but if the substituents are same, then the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: the Hs ortho to substituents and the Hs meta. So that would give two signals. So that's possible.

Alternatively, the substituents are in positions that create symmetry, resulting in two sets of aromatic Hs. So perhaps the substituents are para, but maybe not.

Now, the vinyl Hs: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests perhaps coupling between two vinyl protons and another set. Hmm, maybe the substituent has a double bond. For example, if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached as a substituent on benzene. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2-O-CO-..., but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent would be CH2=CHCOOR, where R is the rest of the molecule.

In that case, the substituent's structure would have a double bond (vinyl group), leading to vinyl protons. The protons on the double bond would split into certain patterns. Let's imagine the structure:

O
||
O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-... Hmm, no, that's not a vinyl. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2-O-CO-... No, that doesn't make sense because that would be a vinyl ether, but perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2COO-O- attached to benzene. No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-... Hmm, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Looking at the NMR, the vinyl Hs are two signals: one doublet (perhaps two protons coupled to one neighboring proton) and another as a doublet of quartets (maybe coupled to two different sets of protons). This suggests that the vinyl group is part of a structure where each H is coupled to different environments.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, such as an allyl ester. Like, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is an allyl group, like CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-... No, that's a propyl group, not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-... No, that's more like a vinyl ether. Alternatively, the substituent could be a benzyl group attached via an ester, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a ring, but that's not matching the data so well.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOOR attached to benzene. So in this case, the structure would be benzene with two substituents, each being CH2=CHCOOR? No, that can't be because it's di-substituted, so maybe one substituent is CH2=CHCOOR and the other is something else, but then I'm not sure how that would fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, and the ester is another substituent. Hmm. Let's imagine the benzene has two substituents: one is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and the other is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R). But then, how would that affect the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, the substituent is a propenoate ester: O-CO-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2- attached to benzene. But that's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't on the ring, but part of a side chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl ester, but that's perhaps complicating things.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-CO-... No, that's a carbonate again, not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached via an ester, but that would not account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is part of an ester group that includes a double bond. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-O..., but I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here, so DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

A) C11H14O2: DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. The benzene ring is 3 (from 3 double bonds), so the substituents would contribute 2 more, perhaps from an ester (double bond in carbonyl) and maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the ester group has a carbonyl (one DoU), and a vinyl group would add another DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. That fits.

Similarly, option B: C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12+2-14)/2=(26-14)/2=6. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5, but this would require another DoU, maybe from a ring or another double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or another ring, but that's not indicated by the NMR.

So maybe the correct formula is one with 5 DoU, which would fit option A (DoU=5) or D (DoU= (2*11+2-12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. Wait, that's 6 DoU. So for D: 6 DoU. Hmm, that's more.

Wait, let me calculate each option's DoU:

Option A: C11H14O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

Option B: C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12+2-14)/2=(26-14)/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2: DoU=(2*12+2-12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So the correct structure should have a DoU that matches.

The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU (from three double bonds). The ester group contributes 1 (the carbonyl). The vinyl group (if present) contributes 1. So total is 3+1+1=5 DoU. So the formula should have DoU=5, which is option A.

Wait, but wait: the substituents could also contribute to other DoU. For example, if a substituent is an ester with a ring, that would add more, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a double bond and an ester. Hmm, but the main ring is 6-membered, so that's the benzene.

So, the substituents could be an ester group and a vinyl group. So each substituent would contribute a DoU. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5, which matches option A.

So the formula for the compound should have 5 DoU, making option A (C11H14O2) a possibility.

Wait, but wait: let me think about the NMR again. The NMR has two signals for aromatic Hs. So, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of Hs, each as doublets or something else, but perhaps this leads to two signals. So that's consistent.

The vinyl Hs: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Let me imagine a structure where the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group.

Suppose the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2- attached somehow. Wait, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, R could be CH2CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm, maybe the substituent is CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the CH2=CHCOO- group would have protons on the double bond: two protons on the CH2 and two on the CH. Wait, but in that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH parts.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH3), but that's a methyl ester. Hmm, but that doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Like, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a double bond nearby. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-CH2CH2, but that's not a vinyl.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester: O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-. No, not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O... No, that would be a carbonate again, not an ester.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to the benzene. So the group would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a vinyl structure. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not a vinyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the NMR signals again.

The two vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So, perhaps one of the vinyl Hs is coupled to one neighboring H (like in a trans configuration) and the other is coupled to two Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, where each H is coupled to one H on the adjacent carbon. So each H would be a doublet.

But the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 and CH would be split as follows. The CH2 protons would be adjacent to the CH and the carbonyl. The CH protons would be adjacent to the CH2 and possibly another group.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-. No, that's not a vinyl either.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. Hmm, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a ring. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group. So benzene has two substituents: one is O-CO-O-R, and the other is CH2=CH-. But that would make the ring have two substituents in some positions, leading to two aromatic signals.

Wait, but how would that fit the NMR? The vinyl protons would be from the CH2=CH- group. So let's say the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene ring. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH groups. The CH2 would be adjacent to the ring, and the CH would be adjacent to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

In that case, the CH2 protons would be coupled to the CH protons, leading to a doublet. The CH protons would be coupled to the CH2 and perhaps another substituent, maybe leading to a quartet. But wait, the NMR has one as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. For example, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. Wait, no, that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, the R group is CH2=CH2, but that's just an ethylene group, not a vinyl. Hmm.

Another approach: the NMR has two CH3 groups. So the molecule has two sets of CH3 protons. That suggests perhaps two different methyl groups, maybe in different environments.

So, perhaps the substituent includes a methyl group, and another part of the molecule has another methyl group. For example, an ester group with a methyl substituent, and another substituent with a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (a methyl ester). Then, the other substituent could be a CH3 group attached elsewhere. But then, how would that fit the NMR signals?

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group.

Alternatively, one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent has a methyl group attached to a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2CH3. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2- but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, substituent as O-CO-OCH2CH2- attached to benzene, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's a carbonate again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, that's not an ester; that's a carbonate.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure.

The compound is di-substituted benzene with an ester group. The NMR shows two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals, and two CH3 signals.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, maybe O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then, the other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-. So the benzene has two substituents: ethyl ester and vinyl.

In such a case, the aromatic ring would have two substituents, let's say para to each other. The aromatic Hs would be in two sets: the Hs ortho to substituents and those meta. So two signals.

The vinyl Hs: if the substituent is CH2=CH-, then the structure is CH2=CH- attached to benzene. So the protons on CH2 and CH would be deshielded. The CH2 protons would be adjacent to the ring and the CH. The CH protons would be adjacent to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, but in that scenario, the CH2 protons would be split by the CH protons. If the CH2 is next to the ring, perhaps the coupling would lead to a doublet.

The CH protons would be coupled to the CH2 protons and possibly to any adjacent protons. But wait, in a CH2=CH- group, each proton on the CH2 is adjacent to the CH, so each would be split into a doublet. The CH protons would see two different environments. Hmm, perhaps the CH2 protons are a doublet, and the CH protons are a quartet.

Wait, but the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the CH2 protons are a doublet (coupled to the CH), and the CH protons are a doublet of quartets, perhaps because they're coupled to two different sets of protons, like two adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a substituent on the vinyl, leading to more coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. In that case, the CH2 and CH would be part of the ester group.

For example, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not a vinyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, etc.

If the compound has a benzene ring (6 carbons), two ester groups would contribute more carbons, but perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with one ester substituent.

Wait, but if the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), that's 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH2CH3: the O is part of the ester, the COO is two oxygens, and the ethyl is two carbons). So the substituent would be 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH2CH3), but wait, that's 3 carbons in the substituent for the ester.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene, so the ester substituent would contribute 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3), perhaps. So the benzene has six carbons, plus substituent carbons.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. If R is ethyl (CH2CH3), then the substituent contributes 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3). So the benzene has 6, plus substituent adds 3, making 9, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps R is a methyl group, making substituent COOCH3, which is 3 carbons (COOCH3 has 3: C from COO and CH3).

Wait, but another substituent is present. So if the substituent is COOCH3, and another substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps CH2=CH-, then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH3) + 2 (CH2=CH-) = 11 carbons. So the formula would be C11H10O2? Because benzene has 6 C, COOCH3 has 3, CH2=CH- has 2, but wait, the CH2=CH- is a substituent, so it's part of the molecule.

Wait, but benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces a H.

Wait, perhaps di-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester, 3 carbons) and the other is CH2=CH- (2 carbons). So total carbons would be 6 +3 +2 = 11. So formula would be C11H? Let's think about the H count.

Benzene (C6H6) with two substituents: each substituent replaces a H.

The substituents are:

O-CO-OCH3: which is -O-CO-OCH3. So that's a group with 3 carbons and 6 Hs (the OCH3 contributes 3 Hs, but the rest are oxygen-bound). Wait, no, the O-CO-OCH3 substituent would have the structure O-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is an ester group.

The other substituent is CH2=CH-, which is a vinyl group. So that's CH2=CH- attached via the CH2. Let's count the Hs.

Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3. The substituent itself has O-CO-OCH3. The OCH3 has 3 Hs. The COO has no Hs. So substituent 1 contributes 3 Hs.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-. The CH2 has 2 Hs, and the CH has 1 H. But wait, in the substituent CH2=CH-, how many Hs are attached? The structure is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be CH2=CH-R, where R is attached to the ring. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH- as a substituent, so the substituent is CH2=CH- attached via the CH2. So the substituent would have CH2=CH- group, which would have 2 Hs on the CH2 and 1 H on the CH. But wait, the CH2 is attached to the ring, which is a benzene. So the substituent would be like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to sketch this.

The substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's a single bond. Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl group attached to the ring. That would be single bonds, not a vinyl.

Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is CH2=CH- attached via the CH2, making the structure benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a vinyl structure, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to count the Hs for the formula.

Assuming the benzene is di-substituted, each substituent removes one H.

So starting with C6H6, each substituent adds its own Hs.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3. The group is O-CO-OCH3, which has no Hs on the O-CO-O part, but the OCH3 has 3 Hs.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-. The group would have CH2=CH-, which has 3 Hs: CH2 has 2, CH has 1.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl. Wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... Wait, no, that's a single bond. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons, 3 H in OCH3) and CH2=CH- (2 carbons, 3 H?), then the total would be C6 + 3 + 2 = C11.

H count: Benzene (6 H), substituent 1 (OCH3 gives 3 H), substituent 2 (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H). So 6 +3 +2 +1 = 12 H. But wait, each substituent replaces a H on the benzene. So the total H would be 6 -2 (since two substituents) + substituent Hs.

So substituent 1 H: OCH3 is 3 H.

Substituent 2 H: CH2=CH- would have 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH, but I'm not sure. Wait, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent, meaning the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl. I'm getting confused again.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is CH2=CH- as a substituent, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the benzene, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that doesn't make sense. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O (but that's a carbonate). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl ester), which would contribute 3 carbons and 7 Hs (CH2-CH2-CH3 has 2+2+3=7 Hs, but wait, the structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 3 carbons in the ester R group.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons, 7 Hs in the R group).

Substituent 2: maybe a methyl group (CH3), which contributes 3 Hs.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +1 (methyl) =10? No, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O (a propyl ester), but that's not right.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O (ethoxy group), but that's an ether, not an ester.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula.

Looking at option D: C11H12O2. So 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

If the benzene is C6H6, and substituents add 5 C and 6 H (since each substituent replaces a H), then 6+5=11 C, and H would be 6 (benzene) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs.

Wait, substituent Hs: if substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, which contributes 3 H (from OCH3), and substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 3 H, then total H would be 6 -2 +3 +3= 10 H. But option D is C11H12O2, which would need 12 H. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CH- which contributes 3 H (2 in CH2, 1 in CH).

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H).

So carbons: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C.

H: Benzene (6) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (3 +3)= 6-2 +6=10 H. But option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. So that's 2 H short. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propyl group with a double bond elsewhere, adding more Hs. Or perhaps substituent 2 has more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). That would be 3 C and 7 H (CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H: 2 in first CH2, 2 in middle CH2, 3 in CH3).

Substituent 2: CH3, which is 1 C and 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 +1=10, which doesn't reach 11. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is 2 C and 4 H.

Wait, but substituent 2 is a vinyl group, so perhaps it's CH2=CH- as a substituent, which would be attached to the benzene. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1).

So substituents:

1. O-CO-OCH3: 3 C, 3 H.

2. CH2=CH-: 2 C, 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 +2=11.

H: Benzene (6) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (3+3)= 6-2+6=10 H. So formula would be C11H10O2. But none of the options match that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and another substituent is a vinyl ester group, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Another approach: the NMR has six signals, which implies six different proton environments.

The aromatic Hs: two signals. So perhaps the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs.

The vinyl Hs: two signals. So the substituent's vinyl group has two different types of Hs.

The CH3 groups: two signals. So two different methyl groups.

So perhaps the structure is:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-R), and the other is a methyl group (CH3).

Wait, but that would give:

Aromatic Hs: two signals (if substituents are para).

Ester group: O-CO-R. R could be a vinyl group, contributing vinyl Hs.

Methyl group: CH3 as another substituent.

Wait, but that would give vinyl Hs as part of the ester. So perhaps the ester's R group is a vinyl group.

For example, R is CH2=CH2, but that's not possible since it's a single bond. Alternatively, R is CH2=CH-... Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O. No, that's getting too long.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester). Then, the substituent contributes three carbons and the propyl group contributes 7 H (CH2CH2CH3).

Another substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 3 H.

So, the total Hs would be:

Benzene (6) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (7 +3) =6-2+10=14 H.

So formula would be C6 +3 (ester R) +1 (methyl) + substituents= C10? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, benzene is C6, the ester's R is propyl (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: 3 C), and the other substituent is methyl (1 C). So total C:6+3+1=10. But the options are C11 or C12. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3 (but that's a carbonate again).

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's getting too long.

Another approach: think about the ester group and the substituent's structure.

The ester group is R-O-CO-O-R', but more likely R-O-CO-R', like methyl ester, ethyl ester, etc.

If the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps the ester has a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), and another CH3 group elsewhere, like as a substituent.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6+3+1=10. So formula would be C10H... Let's count H:

Benzene (6 H) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (3 +3) =6-2 +6=10 H. So formula would be C10H10O2. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2CH3 group, which contributes 2 C and 6 H.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2CH3 (2 C, 6 H).

So C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6 -2 +3 +6=13 H. But option A is C11H14O2, which has 14 H.

Hmm, 13 is one short.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH2CH2 group, but that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2=CH2 group, which is a double bond. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is 2 C and 4 H.

So substituent 1: 3 C, 3 H.

Substituent 2: 2 C, 4 H.

Total C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6 -2 +3 +4=11 H. But that would make the formula C11H11O2, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the molecular formulas again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: molecular weight would be 11*12 +14 +32=132+14+32=178.

B) C12H14O2: 12*12=144 +14=158 +32=190.

C) C12H12O2: 144 +12=156 +32=188.

D) C11H12O2: 132 +12=144 +32=176.

I need to find which formula fits.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but that's a carbonate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), which contributes 3 C and 7 H.

Another substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 1 C and 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. H:6-2 +7 +3=14. So formula would be C10H14O2. That's not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester), which would contribute 4 C and 9 H.

Another substituent is a methyl group (CH3): 1 C, 3 H.

So total C:6 +4 +1=11.

H:6-2 +9 +3=16 H. So formula is C11H16O2, which is not an option.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester with a methyl group.

Wait, the ester could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3 (but that's a carbonate again).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3: 4 C, 9 H.

Another substituent is CH3: 1 C, 3 H.

So total C:6+4+1=11. H:6-2 +9+3=16. Not matching.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula that fits the NMR data.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups, so two different methyl groups. Let's assume each is a substituent.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester: 3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: another methyl group (CH3: 1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. H:6-2 +3+3=10.

So formula would be C10H10O2. Not matching any options.

Hmm. Perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester: 3 C, 5 H).

Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. H:6-2 +5 +3=12.

So formula C10H12O2. Not an option.

Wait, the options have C11, C12. So perhaps I need more carbons.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester: 3 C, 7 H).

Substituent 2 is CH2CH3 (ethyl: 2 C, 5 H).

So total C:6+3+2=11.

H:6-2 +7 +5=16. No, that's 16 H. Not matching.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester: 4 C, 9 H).

Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

Total C:6+4+1=11.

H:6-2 +9 +3=16. Again, not matching.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think in terms of the NMR.

The two CH3 signals: perhaps one is from the ester's R group (like O-CO-OCH3) and another from a substituent (like CH3).

The two vinyl H signals: perhaps from a substituent that's a vinyl group.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H).

So, C:6+3+2=11.

H:6-2 +3+3=10.

Formula: C11H10O2. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to another substituent, making a longer chain. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3 (but that's four C, but perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. No, that's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's a carbonate again.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester: 3 C, 7 H).

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 (ethylene group: 2 C, 4 H).

So total C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6-2 +7 +4=15.

So formula C11H15O2. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Maybe I should look at the ester group and the possible structures.

The NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl Hs. This suggests that one H is coupled to one neighbor (doublet) and another H is coupled to two sets of neighbors (quartets).

If the structure has a trans double bond, perhaps the coupling would produce a certain pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOR, where the R is a methyl group. So substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that's a propenoate ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), which contributes 3 C and 7 H.

Another substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which contributes 2 C and 3 H.

So C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6-2 +7+3=14.

So formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

That fits the H count: 14, which is option A.

So the formula would be C11H14O2, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of signals for CH2 groups suggests that the molecule does not contain such groups.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group is confirmed by the absorption peaks, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and ester functional groups.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate that the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons, likely due to symmetry in the substituents (e.g., para substitution).
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, suggest the presence of a vinyl group (C=C) with specific coupling patterns.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate the presence of two distinct methyl groups in different environments.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C11H14O2**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 5. This matches the structure, as the benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester contributes 1, and the vinyl group contributes 1.
   - **B) C12H14O2**: DoU = 6. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not supported by the NMR data.
   - **C) C12H12O2**: DoU = 7. This exceeds the required degrees of unsaturation for the given structure.
   - **D) C11H12O2**: DoU = 6. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not consistent with the NMR data.

4. **Structural Consistency**:
   - The compound is di-substituted, with one substituent being an ester group (e.g., O-CO-R) and the other being a vinyl group (e.g., CH2=CH-). This arrangement explains the two aromatic proton signals, the two vinyl proton signals, and the two methyl group signals.
   - The molecular formula **C11H14O2** (Option A) fits the NMR data and the degrees of unsaturation.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is **C11H14O2**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means the ring has two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) that absorbs around 1700 cm-1. I remember that esters also have O-H stretches, but wait, no, wait—wait, no, actually, the ester's O is part of the carbonyl and an ether-like linkage. Oh, wait, wait, no, the O ester groups don't have acidic H like in carboxylic acids. So the FTIR shows an ester, so the structure must have one.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows six signals. So the molecule has six distinct proton environments. Let's break down the signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic H. So the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that give two different environments. Like para substitution would have only one set (if both substituents are same), but if they are ortho or meta, perhaps more signals. Wait, but this has two signals, so maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the ring Hs to split into two equivalent sets. For example, if the substituents are para and the same, the ring would have two equivalent Hs each, leading to a doublet or singlet. Hmm, but wait, in para substitution, if both substituents are the same, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: the Hs adjacent to substituents (ortho) and those opposite (para to substituent). Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic Hs would be in two environments. So, perhaps that's what's happening here.

2. Two signals for vinyl H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. So maybe there's an ester group in the structure. Wait, an ester has an oxygen connected to a carbonyl and an R group. The vinyl would be part of an ester's R group, perhaps.

Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R', so the R could be an alkyl group. If the R is a vinyl group, like maybe a substituted ethene (like CH2CH2O?), but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent on the aromatic ring is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent is something like a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2O-... Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes a vinyl, like an ethyl group with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Like, for example, the substituent is a group like CH2CH2-O-CO-R. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent, like maybe a phenyl ester or something else. Wait, maybe the substituent on the benzene is an ester group, such as O-CO-CH2CH3, but that's more like an ethyl ester. Hmm, but the NMR mentions vinyl Hs, which have protons on a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group that's part of a vinyl group. Like, perhaps the substituent is something like CH2CH2-O-CO-..., but that doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2COOR, but that's a ketone, not an ester. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, such as CH2=CHCOOR. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain, so maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOOR attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, then maybe the ring substituents are two ester groups or one. Wait, no, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. But wait, the FTIR shows ester groups, so perhaps one of the substituents is an ester. Or maybe both are esters? But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-O-R, but wait, that's a carbonate, not an ester. No, esters are R-O-CO-R'.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. But wait, that's more like a carbonate again. Hmm.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-CH2CH3, and the other substituent is something else. But then the aromatic Hs would have two signals, as in the case of a para substitution, perhaps.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR signals. The NMR has two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals, and two CH3 signals. So six signals in total. Let's consider that.

So the aromatic Hs: two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two distinct sets of Hs. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, and the ring is symmetrical, leading to two equivalent Hs in each set. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, but that might give more signals.

Wait, let's think about a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. No, wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. So if both substituents are in the para positions, but if the substituents are same, then the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: the Hs ortho to substituents and the Hs meta. So that would give two signals. So that's possible.

Alternatively, the substituents are in positions that create symmetry, resulting in two sets of aromatic Hs. So perhaps the substituents are para, but maybe not.

Now, the vinyl Hs: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests perhaps coupling between two vinyl protons and another set. Hmm, maybe the substituent has a double bond. For example, if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached as a substituent on benzene. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2-O-CO-..., but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent would be CH2=CHCOOR, where R is the rest of the molecule.

In that case, the substituent's structure would have a double bond (vinyl group), leading to vinyl protons. The protons on the double bond would split into certain patterns. Let's imagine the structure:

O
||
O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-... Hmm, no, that's not a vinyl. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2-O-CO-... No, that doesn't make sense because that would be a vinyl ether, but perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2COO-O- attached to benzene. No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-... Hmm, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Looking at the NMR, the vinyl Hs are two signals: one doublet (perhaps two protons coupled to one neighboring proton) and another as a doublet of quartets (maybe coupled to two different sets of protons). This suggests that the vinyl group is part of a structure where each H is coupled to different environments.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, such as an allyl ester. Like, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is an allyl group, like CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-... No, that's a propyl group, not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-... No, that's more like a vinyl ether. Alternatively, the substituent could be a benzyl group attached via an ester, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a ring, but that's not matching the data so well.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOOR attached to benzene. So in this case, the structure would be benzene with two substituents, each being CH2=CHCOOR? No, that can't be because it's di-substituted, so maybe one substituent is CH2=CHCOOR and the other is something else, but then I'm not sure how that would fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, and the ester is another substituent. Hmm. Let's imagine the benzene has two substituents: one is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and the other is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R). But then, how would that affect the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, the substituent is a propenoate ester: O-CO-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2- attached to benzene. But that's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't on the ring, but part of a side chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl ester, but that's perhaps complicating things.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-CO-... No, that's a carbonate again, not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached via an ester, but that would not account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is part of an ester group that includes a double bond. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-O..., but I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here, so DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

A) C11H14O2: DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. The benzene ring is 3 (from 3 double bonds), so the substituents would contribute 2 more, perhaps from an ester (double bond in carbonyl) and maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the ester group has a carbonyl (one DoU), and a vinyl group would add another DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. That fits.

Similarly, option B: C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12+2-14)/2=(26-14)/2=6. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5, but this would require another DoU, maybe from a ring or another double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or another ring, but that's not indicated by the NMR.

So maybe the correct formula is one with 5 DoU, which would fit option A (DoU=5) or D (DoU= (2*11+2-12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. Wait, that's 6 DoU. So for D: 6 DoU. Hmm, that's more.

Wait, let me calculate each option's DoU:

Option A: C11H14O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

Option B: C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12+2-14)/2=(26-14)/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2: DoU=(2*12+2-12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So the correct structure should have a DoU that matches.

The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU (from three double bonds). The ester group contributes 1 (the carbonyl). The vinyl group (if present) contributes 1. So total is 3+1+1=5 DoU. So the formula should have DoU=5, which is option A.

Wait, but wait: the substituents could also contribute to other DoU. For example, if a substituent is an ester with a ring, that would add more, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a double bond and an ester. Hmm, but the main ring is 6-membered, so that's the benzene.

So, the substituents could be an ester group and a vinyl group. So each substituent would contribute a DoU. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5, which matches option A.

So the formula for the compound should have 5 DoU, making option A (C11H14O2) a possibility.

Wait, but wait: let me think about the NMR again. The NMR has two signals for aromatic Hs. So, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of Hs, each as doublets or something else, but perhaps this leads to two signals. So that's consistent.

The vinyl Hs: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Let me imagine a structure where the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group.

Suppose the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2- attached somehow. Wait, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, R could be CH2CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm, maybe the substituent is CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the CH2=CHCOO- group would have protons on the double bond: two protons on the CH2 and two on the CH. Wait, but in that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH parts.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH3), but that's a methyl ester. Hmm, but that doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Like, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a double bond nearby. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-CH2CH2, but that's not a vinyl.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester: O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-. No, not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O... No, that would be a carbonate again, not an ester.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to the benzene. So the group would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a vinyl structure. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not a vinyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the NMR signals again.

The two vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So, perhaps one of the vinyl Hs is coupled to one neighboring H (like in a trans configuration) and the other is coupled to two Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a trans double bond, where each H is coupled to one H on the adjacent carbon. So each H would be a doublet.

But the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 and CH would be split as follows. The CH2 protons would be adjacent to the CH and the carbonyl. The CH protons would be adjacent to the CH2 and possibly another group.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-. No, that's not a vinyl either.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. Hmm, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a ring. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group. So benzene has two substituents: one is O-CO-O-R, and the other is CH2=CH-. But that would make the ring have two substituents in some positions, leading to two aromatic signals.

Wait, but how would that fit the NMR? The vinyl protons would be from the CH2=CH- group. So let's say the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene ring. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH groups. The CH2 would be adjacent to the ring, and the CH would be adjacent to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

In that case, the CH2 protons would be coupled to the CH protons, leading to a doublet. The CH protons would be coupled to the CH2 and perhaps another substituent, maybe leading to a quartet. But wait, the NMR has one as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. For example, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. Wait, no, that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, the R group is CH2=CH2, but that's just an ethylene group, not a vinyl. Hmm.

Another approach: the NMR has two CH3 groups. So the molecule has two sets of CH3 protons. That suggests perhaps two different methyl groups, maybe in different environments.

So, perhaps the substituent includes a methyl group, and another part of the molecule has another methyl group. For example, an ester group with a methyl substituent, and another substituent with a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (a methyl ester). Then, the other substituent could be a CH3 group attached elsewhere. But then, how would that fit the NMR signals?

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group.

Alternatively, one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent has a methyl group attached to a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2CH3. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2- but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, substituent as O-CO-OCH2CH2- attached to benzene, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's a carbonate again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, that's not an ester; that's a carbonate.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure.

The compound is di-substituted benzene with an ester group. The NMR shows two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals, and two CH3 signals.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, maybe O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then, the other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-. So the benzene has two substituents: ethyl ester and vinyl.

In such a case, the aromatic ring would have two substituents, let's say para to each other. The aromatic Hs would be in two sets: the Hs ortho to substituents and those meta. So two signals.

The vinyl Hs: if the substituent is CH2=CH-, then the structure is CH2=CH- attached to benzene. So the protons on CH2 and CH would be deshielded. The CH2 protons would be adjacent to the ring and the CH. The CH protons would be adjacent to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, but in that scenario, the CH2 protons would be split by the CH protons. If the CH2 is next to the ring, perhaps the coupling would lead to a doublet.

The CH protons would be coupled to the CH2 protons and possibly to any adjacent protons. But wait, in a CH2=CH- group, each proton on the CH2 is adjacent to the CH, so each would be split into a doublet. The CH protons would see two different environments. Hmm, perhaps the CH2 protons are a doublet, and the CH protons are a quartet.

Wait, but the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the CH2 protons are a doublet (coupled to the CH), and the CH protons are a doublet of quartets, perhaps because they're coupled to two different sets of protons, like two adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a substituent on the vinyl, leading to more coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. In that case, the CH2 and CH would be part of the ester group.

For example, the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not a vinyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, etc.

If the compound has a benzene ring (6 carbons), two ester groups would contribute more carbons, but perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with one ester substituent.

Wait, but if the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), that's 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH2CH3: the O is part of the ester, the COO is two oxygens, and the ethyl is two carbons). So the substituent would be 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH2CH3), but wait, that's 3 carbons in the substituent for the ester.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene, so the ester substituent would contribute 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3), perhaps. So the benzene has six carbons, plus substituent carbons.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. If R is ethyl (CH2CH3), then the substituent contributes 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3). So the benzene has 6, plus substituent adds 3, making 9, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps R is a methyl group, making substituent COOCH3, which is 3 carbons (COOCH3 has 3: C from COO and CH3).

Wait, but another substituent is present. So if the substituent is COOCH3, and another substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps CH2=CH-, then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH3) + 2 (CH2=CH-) = 11 carbons. So the formula would be C11H10O2? Because benzene has 6 C, COOCH3 has 3, CH2=CH- has 2, but wait, the CH2=CH- is a substituent, so it's part of the molecule.

Wait, but benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces a H.

Wait, perhaps di-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester, 3 carbons) and the other is CH2=CH- (2 carbons). So total carbons would be 6 +3 +2 = 11. So formula would be C11H? Let's think about the H count.

Benzene (C6H6) with two substituents: each substituent replaces a H.

The substituents are:

O-CO-OCH3: which is -O-CO-OCH3. So that's a group with 3 carbons and 6 Hs (the OCH3 contributes 3 Hs, but the rest are oxygen-bound). Wait, no, the O-CO-OCH3 substituent would have the structure O-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is an ester group.

The other substituent is CH2=CH-, which is a vinyl group. So that's CH2=CH- attached via the CH2. Let's count the Hs.

Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3. The substituent itself has O-CO-OCH3. The OCH3 has 3 Hs. The COO has no Hs. So substituent 1 contributes 3 Hs.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-. The CH2 has 2 Hs, and the CH has 1 H. But wait, in the substituent CH2=CH-, how many Hs are attached? The structure is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be CH2=CH-R, where R is attached to the ring. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH- as a substituent, so the substituent is CH2=CH- attached via the CH2. So the substituent would have CH2=CH- group, which would have 2 Hs on the CH2 and 1 H on the CH. But wait, the CH2 is attached to the ring, which is a benzene. So the substituent would be like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to sketch this.

The substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's a single bond. Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl group attached to the ring. That would be single bonds, not a vinyl.

Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is CH2=CH- attached via the CH2, making the structure benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a vinyl structure, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to count the Hs for the formula.

Assuming the benzene is di-substituted, each substituent removes one H.

So starting with C6H6, each substituent adds its own Hs.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3. The group is O-CO-OCH3, which has no Hs on the O-CO-O part, but the OCH3 has 3 Hs.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-. The group would have CH2=CH-, which has 3 Hs: CH2 has 2, CH has 1.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl. Wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... Wait, no, that's a single bond. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons, 3 H in OCH3) and CH2=CH- (2 carbons, 3 H?), then the total would be C6 + 3 + 2 = C11.

H count: Benzene (6 H), substituent 1 (OCH3 gives 3 H), substituent 2 (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H). So 6 +3 +2 +1 = 12 H. But wait, each substituent replaces a H on the benzene. So the total H would be 6 -2 (since two substituents) + substituent Hs.

So substituent 1 H: OCH3 is 3 H.

Substituent 2 H: CH2=CH- would have 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH, but I'm not sure. Wait, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent, meaning the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-... No, that's not a vinyl. I'm getting confused again.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is CH2=CH- as a substituent, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the benzene, so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that doesn't make sense. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O (but that's a carbonate). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl ester), which would contribute 3 carbons and 7 Hs (CH2-CH2-CH3 has 2+2+3=7 Hs, but wait, the structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 3 carbons in the ester R group.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons, 7 Hs in the R group).

Substituent 2: maybe a methyl group (CH3), which contributes 3 Hs.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +1 (methyl) =10? No, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O (a propyl ester), but that's not right.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O (ethoxy group), but that's an ether, not an ester.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula.

Looking at option D: C11H12O2. So 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

If the benzene is C6H6, and substituents add 5 C and 6 H (since each substituent replaces a H), then 6+5=11 C, and H would be 6 (benzene) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs.

Wait, substituent Hs: if substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, which contributes 3 H (from OCH3), and substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 3 H, then total H would be 6 -2 +3 +3= 10 H. But option D is C11H12O2, which would need 12 H. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CH- which contributes 3 H (2 in CH2, 1 in CH).

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H).

So carbons: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C.

H: Benzene (6) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (3 +3)= 6-2 +6=10 H. But option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. So that's 2 H short. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propyl group with a double bond elsewhere, adding more Hs. Or perhaps substituent 2 has more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). That would be 3 C and 7 H (CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H: 2 in first CH2, 2 in middle CH2, 3 in CH3).

Substituent 2: CH3, which is 1 C and 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 +1=10, which doesn't reach 11. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is 2 C and 4 H.

Wait, but substituent 2 is a vinyl group, so perhaps it's CH2=CH- as a substituent, which would be attached to the benzene. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1).

So substituents:

1. O-CO-OCH3: 3 C, 3 H.

2. CH2=CH-: 2 C, 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 +2=11.

H: Benzene (6) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (3+3)= 6-2+6=10 H. So formula would be C11H10O2. But none of the options match that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and another substituent is a vinyl ester group, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Another approach: the NMR has six signals, which implies six different proton environments.

The aromatic Hs: two signals. So perhaps the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs.

The vinyl Hs: two signals. So the substituent's vinyl group has two different types of Hs.

The CH3 groups: two signals. So two different methyl groups.

So perhaps the structure is:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-R), and the other is a methyl group (CH3).

Wait, but that would give:

Aromatic Hs: two signals (if substituents are para).

Ester group: O-CO-R. R could be a vinyl group, contributing vinyl Hs.

Methyl group: CH3 as another substituent.

Wait, but that would give vinyl Hs as part of the ester. So perhaps the ester's R group is a vinyl group.

For example, R is CH2=CH2, but that's not possible since it's a single bond. Alternatively, R is CH2=CH-... Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O. No, that's getting too long.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester). Then, the substituent contributes three carbons and the propyl group contributes 7 H (CH2CH2CH3).

Another substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 3 H.

So, the total Hs would be:

Benzene (6) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (7 +3) =6-2+10=14 H.

So formula would be C6 +3 (ester R) +1 (methyl) + substituents= C10? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, benzene is C6, the ester's R is propyl (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: 3 C), and the other substituent is methyl (1 C). So total C:6+3+1=10. But the options are C11 or C12. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3 (but that's a carbonate again).

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's getting too long.

Another approach: think about the ester group and the substituent's structure.

The ester group is R-O-CO-O-R', but more likely R-O-CO-R', like methyl ester, ethyl ester, etc.

If the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps the ester has a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), and another CH3 group elsewhere, like as a substituent.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6+3+1=10. So formula would be C10H... Let's count H:

Benzene (6 H) -2 (substituents) + substituent Hs (3 +3) =6-2 +6=10 H. So formula would be C10H10O2. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2CH3 group, which contributes 2 C and 6 H.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2CH3 (2 C, 6 H).

So C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6 -2 +3 +6=13 H. But option A is C11H14O2, which has 14 H.

Hmm, 13 is one short.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH2CH2 group, but that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2=CH2 group, which is a double bond. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is 2 C and 4 H.

So substituent 1: 3 C, 3 H.

Substituent 2: 2 C, 4 H.

Total C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6 -2 +3 +4=11 H. But that would make the formula C11H11O2, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the molecular formulas again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2: molecular weight would be 11*12 +14 +32=132+14+32=178.

B) C12H14O2: 12*12=144 +14=158 +32=190.

C) C12H12O2: 144 +12=156 +32=188.

D) C11H12O2: 132 +12=144 +32=176.

I need to find which formula fits.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but that's a carbonate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), which contributes 3 C and 7 H.

Another substituent is a methyl group (CH3), contributing 1 C and 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. H:6-2 +7 +3=14. So formula would be C10H14O2. That's not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester), which would contribute 4 C and 9 H.

Another substituent is a methyl group (CH3): 1 C, 3 H.

So total C:6 +4 +1=11.

H:6-2 +9 +3=16 H. So formula is C11H16O2, which is not an option.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester with a methyl group.

Wait, the ester could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3 (but that's a carbonate again).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3: 4 C, 9 H.

Another substituent is CH3: 1 C, 3 H.

So total C:6+4+1=11. H:6-2 +9+3=16. Not matching.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula that fits the NMR data.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups, so two different methyl groups. Let's assume each is a substituent.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester: 3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: another methyl group (CH3: 1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. H:6-2 +3+3=10.

So formula would be C10H10O2. Not matching any options.

Hmm. Perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester: 3 C, 5 H).

Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. H:6-2 +5 +3=12.

So formula C10H12O2. Not an option.

Wait, the options have C11, C12. So perhaps I need more carbons.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester: 3 C, 7 H).

Substituent 2 is CH2CH3 (ethyl: 2 C, 5 H).

So total C:6+3+2=11.

H:6-2 +7 +5=16. No, that's 16 H. Not matching.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester: 4 C, 9 H).

Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

Total C:6+4+1=11.

H:6-2 +9 +3=16. Again, not matching.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think in terms of the NMR.

The two CH3 signals: perhaps one is from the ester's R group (like O-CO-OCH3) and another from a substituent (like CH3).

The two vinyl H signals: perhaps from a substituent that's a vinyl group.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H).

So, C:6+3+2=11.

H:6-2 +3+3=10.

Formula: C11H10O2. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to another substituent, making a longer chain. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3 (but that's four C, but perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. No, that's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's a carbonate again.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester: 3 C, 7 H).

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 (ethylene group: 2 C, 4 H).

So total C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6-2 +7 +4=15.

So formula C11H15O2. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Maybe I should look at the ester group and the possible structures.

The NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the vinyl Hs. This suggests that one H is coupled to one neighbor (doublet) and another H is coupled to two sets of neighbors (quartets).

If the structure has a trans double bond, perhaps the coupling would produce a certain pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOR, where the R is a methyl group. So substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that's a propenoate ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3. No, that's a carbonate.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), which contributes 3 C and 7 H.

Another substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which contributes 2 C and 3 H.

So C:6 +3 +2=11.

H:6-2 +7+3=14.

So formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

That fits the H count: 14, which is option A.

So the formula would be C11H14O2, option A.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of signals for CH2 groups suggests that the molecule does not contain such groups.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group is confirmed by the absorption peaks, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and ester functional groups.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate that the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons, likely due to symmetry in the substituents (e.g., para substitution).
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, suggest the presence of a vinyl group (C=C) with specific coupling patterns.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate the presence of two distinct methyl groups in different environments.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C11H14O2**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 5. This matches the structure, as the benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester contributes 1, and the vinyl group contributes 1.
   - **B) C12H14O2**: DoU = 6. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not supported by the NMR data.
   - **C) C12H12O2**: DoU = 7. This exceeds the required degrees of unsaturation for the given structure.
   - **D) C11H12O2**: DoU = 6. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not consistent with the NMR data.

4. **Structural Consistency**:
   - The compound is di-substituted, with one substituent being an ester group (e.g., O-CO-R) and the other being a vinyl group (e.g., CH2=CH-). This arrangement explains the two aromatic proton signals, the two vinyl proton signals, and the two methyl group signals.
   - The molecular formula **C11H14O2** (Option A) fits the NMR data and the degrees of unsaturation.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is **C11H14O2**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
