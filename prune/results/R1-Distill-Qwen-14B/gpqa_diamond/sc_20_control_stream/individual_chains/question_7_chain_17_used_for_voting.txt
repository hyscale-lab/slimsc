Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, which is like the afterglow of the Big Bang. The question is about when high-energy gamma-rays interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-.

The problem is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. I think the key here is to find the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime.

Wait, so I need to find the energy where the mean free path of the gamma-ray is such that it can't travel far without annihilating. The lifetime would be limited by the time it takes for the gamma to annihilate, which depends on the cross-section and the density of the CMB photons.

I remember that the cross-section for this process, gamma + photon → e+ e-, depends on the energy of the gamma and the photon. The cross-section σ is proportional to some function of their energies. But wait, I think for high-energy gamma-rays, the cross-section has a specific form. Oh right, I think it's approximately σ ~ (E_cm^2) / (m_e^2), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. Because when E_cm is much larger than the electron mass, the cross-section increases with E_cm squared.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (in the cosmic frame), the spatial part would be (p1 - p2) if they're moving head-on. Wait, no, actually, the CMB photons are isotropic, but the gamma-ray is moving through them. So perhaps we can model this as a head-on collision for the most probable interaction.

Wait, another approach: when a gamma photon interacts with a background photon (like CMB), the threshold condition for pair production is when the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is sufficient to create an electron-positron pair. The threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c², right? Because each particle (e+ and e-) has rest mass m_e.

So the minimum energy needed for the gamma and CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair is when s = (2 m_e c²)^2. So s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (something). Wait, but since photons are massless, their energy is equal to their momentum times c. So for the CMB photon, E_cmb ≈ k c, where k is the wavevector. Similarly, the gamma has E_gamma = p_gamma c.

In the center-of-mass frame, the total energy squared is (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2 cos(theta), but for the maximum possible, theta is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) = -1. Wait, maybe it's better to set the photons moving directly towards each other. So in that case, the total energy is E_gamma + E_cmb, and the total momentum is p_gamma c - p_cmb c. Wait, no, because for photons, the momentum is E/(c) in magnitude, but direction matters.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Assuming they collide head-on, so p2 is opposite to p1. So p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. So p1 c - p2 c would be (p1 + p2) c? Wait, no, because p2 is in the opposite direction, so it's p1 c + p2 c in the same direction. So when you square it, it's (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Wait, let me think again. Photons have momentum p = E/c, but direction matters. So if photon 1 (gamma) is moving in the +x direction, and photon 2 (CMB) is moving in the -x direction, then their momenta are p1 in +x and p2 in -x, so their vectors are p1 = +E1/(c) * x_hat, p2 = -E2/(c) * x_hat.

So the total momentum is p1 + p2 = (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) x_hat.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Wait, because the invariant s is (sum E)^2 - (sum (p c))^2. So sum p c is (p1 c) + (p2 c) = (E1/c * c) + (E2/c * (-c)) * (-1))? Wait, no, the p2 would be in the negative x direction. So p2 c is (-E2/(c)) * c ) = -E2. So sum (p c) is E1 - E2.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding that: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So for the process to be possible, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

We can compute m_e c^2. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so (0.511e6 eV)^2.

Wait, let's compute that. m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

0.511^2 is about 0.261, so 0.261e12 eV².

Now, E_gamma * E_cmb >= 0.261e12 eV².

We know E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, but that seems really high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261 * 1e12) / 1e-3 ) eV.

Which is 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

But wait, 1e14 eV is 1e8 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

So 2.61e14 eV = 261e9 eV = 261 GeV.

But wait, that's 2.61e2 GeV. But the options are much higher, like 1e5 GeV and so on.

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me redo the calculation more carefully.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 eV².

So (m_e c^2)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Wait, no, wait: (0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * (1e5)^2 = 26.1121 * 1e10 = 2.61121e11 eV².

So E_gamma * E_cmb >= 2.61e11 eV².

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV.

2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait, 2.61e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So E_gamma = approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

But wait, I remember that the cross-section for this process depends on the energy as sigma ~ E_gamma^2. Because in the cross-section formula, for high energies, the cross-section increases with the square of the CM energy. So the cross-section is proportional to sigma ~ (E_cm^2)/(m_e^2). Since E_cm = sqrt(4 E_gamma E_cmb) ≈ 2 sqrt(E_gamma E_cmb), so sigma ~ (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2). 

But wait, the cross-section is also a function of the photon energies. Hmm. The cross-section for pair production by a gamma and a photon scales as sigma ~ (E_cm^2)/(m_e^2) (when E_cm >> m_e) but E_cm is sqrt(4 E_gamma E_cmb), so E_cm^2 is 4 E_gamma E_cmb.

So sigma ~ (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2) * (1/(E_gamma + E_cmb))^2? Or perhaps a different dependence.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section actually scales as sigma ~ (E_gamma^2)/(m_e^2) when the photon energy is much smaller than the gamma's. Because the CMB photon has E_cmb << E_gamma, so E_cmb can be approximated as negligible compared to E_gamma. So then E_cm ≈ sqrt(4 E_gamma E_cmb) ≈ 2 sqrt(E_gamma E_cmb), but if E_gamma >> E_cmb, then E_cm ≈ 2 sqrt(E_gamma E_cmb) ≈ 2 E_cmb (sqrt(E_gamma / E_cmb)).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the annihilation cross-section formula. The cross-section for a gamma and photon to produce an electron-positron pair is given by the Klein-Nishina formula, but I think in the high-energy limit, the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * ... Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to find the expression for the cross-section.

Alternatively, the cross-section for pair production by a gamma and a photon is given by:

sigma ≈ (8 π m_e^2 c^4)/(3 E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1 + cos^2(theta)),

where theta is the angle between the gamma and the CMB photon. The maximum cross-section occurs when theta is 0 (same direction) or 180 (opposite), which gives cos(theta)=±1. So the maximum cross-section is sigma_max ≈ (16 π m_e^2 c^4)/(3 E_gamma E_cmb) ).

But the average is probably a factor, but for the purpose of calculation, maybe using the maximum makes sense, or perhaps the average over angles.

But maybe it's better to model this as the probability of interaction per unit length. The mean free path lambda is 1/(n sigma v), where n is the number density of CMB photons, sigma is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity.

Wait, but since the CMB photons are isotropic, the gamma-ray would have a certain interaction rate. Let me think about the interaction rate approach.

The interaction rate per unit length is R = n * sigma * v_rel, where v_rel is the relative velocity between the gamma and the CMB photon. For photons, since they are massless, their velocity is c, but the relative velocity would depend on their directions.

Alternatively, the mean free path λ is the distance between interactions, so λ ≈ 1/(n sigma c), since each photon is moving at speed c and the number density is n.

The number density n of CMB photons can be found from the CMB photon density. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum with temperature T. The average photon energy is given as E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. For a blackbody, the average photon energy is about 2.7 k_B T, so T ≈ E_cmb/(2.7 k_B).

But wait, the number density n is given by (energy density)/(E_cmb) times a factor. Alternatively, the photon number density in the CMB is n = (energy density) / (average photon energy). The energy density u of the CMB is about 1e-4 erg/cm³. Let me compute that into eV per cm³.

Wait, 1 erg = 1e7 eV, so 1e-4 erg/cm³ = 1e3 eV/cm³. So u = 1e3 eV/cm³.

The average photon energy E_avg is given as 1e-3 eV. So n = u / E_avg = 1e3 eV/cm³ / 1e-3 eV = 1e6 / cm³.

Wait, because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, but perhaps that's not important right now. So n ≈ 1e6 cm^-3.

But wait, actually, the number density of CMB photons is about 411 photons per cm³. Because the CMB is about 2.7 K, and the photon number density is (2.7 K)^3 * (something). Wait, I think the standard number is around 411 photons/cm³. Let me think about that.

The formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody is n = (8 pi g_{\gamma} k_B^3)/(h^3 c^3) * (T^3 / (e^{x} - 1)) ), where x = h c/(k_B T). At T=2.7 K, x is about 0.001 or so, so e^x ≈ 1 + x. But I'm not sure about the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the photon energy density u = 411 photons/cm³ * average energy of 1e-3 eV. Wait, if the average energy is 1e-3 eV per photon, and number density is 411 per cm³, then the energy density is 411 * 1e-3 eV = 0.411 eV/cm³. But earlier I thought the energy density is about 1e3 eV/cm³. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's get the actual CMB photon number density. The CMB temperature is T ≈ 2.7 K. The number density of photons is given by n = (2ζ(3)/π^2) * (k_B T)^3 / (h c)^3 ) * (g_{\gamma} ), where g_{\gamma} is the degrees of freedom, which is 2 for photons.

But wait, the formula is n = (2 g_{\gamma})/ (h^3 c^3) ) * (k_B T)^3 * (4 pi) / (ζ(3)).

Wait, perhaps I should just look it up, but since I can't do that right now, I'll approximate. At T=2.7 K, the number density is about 411 cm^-3. So n ≈ 4e2 cm^-3.

But earlier, when I thought that the energy density u is 1e-4 erg/cm³, which is 1e3 eV/cm³. So 411 photons/cm³ * 1e-3 eV/photon = 0.411 eV/cm³, which is less than 1e3 eV/cm³. So perhaps the energy density is 1e3 eV/cm³, which would imply that the average photon energy is 1e3 eV / 411 photons/cm³ ≈ 2.4 eV. But the question says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So perhaps the universe's CMB has an average photon energy of 1e-3 eV. That would imply a temperature T where (k_B T) ≈ 1e-3 eV.

Compute T: 1e-3 eV = k_B T. k_B is about 8.617e-5 eV/K. So T = (1e-3 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 11.6 K. Wait, but the CMB is about 2.7 K. So maybe the problem is hypothetical, and the average photon energy is given, so perhaps I should proceed with that value.

So given that E_cmb = 1e-3 eV, and the number density n is u / E_avg. Let's compute u.

The energy density u of the CMB is roughly 1e-4 erg/cm³. Converting to eV: 1 erg = 1e7 eV, so 1e-4 erg = 1e3 eV. So u = 1e3 eV/cm³.

So n = u / E_avg = 1e3 eV/cm³ / 1e-3 eV = 1e6 cm^-3.

Wait, that's 1e6 photons/cm³, which seems high. Because the CMB is much less dense. So perhaps the given average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, but the energy density is about 1e-4 erg/cm³ (which is 1e3 eV/cm³), so n = 1e3 eV/cm³ / 1e-3 eV = 1e6 photons/cm³. Hmm, that's 1e6 per cm³, which is 1e12 per m³. That's a lot, but maybe in this problem's context, it's given.

So the number density n is 1e6 cm^-3.

Now, the cross-section sigma for gamma + photon → e+ e- is given by the formula:

sigma ≈ (8 π/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) (1 + cos^2(theta)).

But since the CMB photons are isotropic, we can average over all angles. The average value of (1+cos^2 theta) is (2/3)(1 + 1) ) because the average of 1 + cos^2(theta) over a sphere is 2/3 * (some factor). Wait, the integral of (1 + cos^2 theta) over all solid angles is:

Integral = ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta dtheta dphi from 0 to pi, 0 to 2pi.

Let me compute it. The integral over phi is 2 pi. The integral over theta is ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta from 0 to pi.

Let u = cos theta, du = - sin theta d theta. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 + u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1. So it's ∫ (1+u²) du from -1 to 1.

Which is [u + (u^3)/3 ] from -1 to 1. Plugging in:

(1 + 1/3) - (-1 - 1/3) ) = (4/3) - (-4/3) )= 8/3.

So the total integral is 2 pi * 8/3 = (16/3) pi.

So the average value of (1 + cos^2 theta) is (16/3 pi) ) / (4 pi) ) = (16/3)/(4) )= 4/3.

Wait, no, the average is [Integral (1 + cos^2 theta) d Omega ] / (4 pi).

So the average is (16 pi/3) ) / (4 pi) ) = 4/3.

So average sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (4/3) * (1/(4 pi)) )? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average cross-section.

Wait, the cross-section is sigma(theta) = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) (1 + cos^2 theta).

The average cross-section is sigma_avg = (1/(4 pi)) ∫ sigma(theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

The integral over phi is 2 pi. The integral over theta is ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta from 0 to pi, which is 8/3 as before.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) * (2 pi) * (8/3) ).

Wait, let me compute that step by step. The integral over theta is 8/3. The integral over phi is 2 pi. So the total integral is 2 pi * 8/3 = 16 pi/3.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. The expression should be:

sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4/(E_gamma E_cmb)) * (1/(4 pi)) * ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

So the integrals are 2 pi * (8/3) = 16 pi/3.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4/(E_gamma E_cmb)) ) * (1/(4 pi)) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, that seems complicated. Let's compute it.

sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the average cross-section from the integral.

Wait,

sigma_avg = (8 pi /3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

Compute the integral:

∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi from theta 0 to pi, phi 0 to 2 pi.

As before, the integral is (16/3) pi.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, so putting it all together:

sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Compute that:

(8 pi/3) * (1/(4 pi)) ) = (8 pi)/(3 *4 pi) ) = 2/(3).

Then multiply by (16 pi/3):

2/3 * (16 pi/3) ) = (32 pi)/(9).

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the average cross-section. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section scales as sigma ~ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ). So for the purposes of finding the energy where the lifetime is limited, perhaps we can model sigma as proportional to 1/(E_gamma * E_cmb), since E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV.

So the cross-section sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ).

But wait, the exact formula may have other factors, but for order of magnitude, this should suffice.

Now, the interaction rate is R = n sigma v, where v is the relative velocity between the gamma and the CMB photon. Since both are moving at speed c, but in opposite directions for maximum effect, their relative speed is 2c. Wait, but photons have velocity c in their own frames. Hmm, perhaps the relative velocity in the lab frame is c (gamma moving) and photon moving in opposite direction, so their relative velocity is 2c, but that's a big number. However, in the cross-section formula, the velocity is incorporated. Wait, perhaps the cross-section already accounts for the relative velocity, so the interaction rate is R = n sigma c, because the gamma is moving at speed c, and the CMB photons are isotropic, so the relative speed is c for each photon.

Wait, more accurately, the interaction rate is given by R = n sigma c, where c is the speed of the gamma-ray. Because the gamma is moving with speed c, and the CMB photons are at rest in the cosmic frame, but their number density is n. So each CMB photon is moving, but on average, the interaction rate is proportional to n sigma c.

So the mean free path is lambda = 1/(n sigma c).

The lifetime t is related to the distance traveled as t = lambda / (gamma's speed), which is c. So t = lambda / c = 1/(n sigma c^2).

Wait, no. Because the mean free path is the average distance before an interaction. So if the gamma travels a distance L, the probability of interaction is 1 - e^{-L/lambda} ≈ L/lambda for small L. So the lifetime without interaction is when L ≈ lambda, which is L = c t.

So lambda = c t.

But the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by how long it takes to interact, so the interaction time is t = 1/(n sigma c).

Wait, let me think again.

The mean free path lambda is the average distance a gamma travels before interacting. So, the time taken to travel lambda is t = lambda / c.

Lambda is 1/(n sigma c), because R = n sigma c (interaction rate per unit length). So lambda = 1/(n sigma c).

Thus, t = lambda / c = 1/(n sigma c^2).

So the lifetime is t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

We want to find the gamma-ray energy E_gamma where this process becomes significant, i.e., where the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So perhaps when the age of the universe is approximately equal to t, but I think the problem is more about when the interaction rate is such that the gamma cannot propagate without annihilating, so the energy where the mean free path is comparable to the size of the universe.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is when the photon's lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe, which is about 1e10 years. But perhaps the problem is more about the energy where the interaction rate becomes so high that the photon's lifetime is limited, so the energy where the photon cannot travel large distances without annihilating.

But perhaps the key point is to find when the photon's lifetime t is approximately the age of the universe. Let's compute t.

t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

We have n = 1e6 cm^-3 = 1e6 / (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e6 / 1e-6 m^3 = 1e12 m^-3.

But wait, actually, 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3. Because 1 cm = 1e-2 m, so 1 cm^3 = (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e-6 m^3. So 1 cm^-3 = 1e6 m^-3.

So n = 1e6 cm^-3 = 1e6 * 1e6 m^-3 = 1e12 m^-3.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 cm^3 is (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e-6 m^3. So 1 cm^-3 is 1 m^3 / 1e-6 m^3 = 1e6 m^-3. So 1e6 cm^-3 is 1e6 * 1e6 m^-3 = 1e12 m^-3.

So n = 1e12 m^-3.

Now, sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ).

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV².

So sigma ≈ (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma.

But wait, E_gamma is in eV.

So sigma ≈ (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma.

But E_gamma is in eV, so sigma has units of eV which is wrong for a cross-section. Oh wait, no, cross-section has units of area, which is in m² or barns (1 barn = 1e-28 m²). Let me check the units.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in compatible units.

Let me compute sigma in m².

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

E_gamma is in eV.

So sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb).

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

E_gamma * E_cmb = E_gamma * 1e-3 eV.

So sigma ≈ (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma.

But sigma must be in m². So I need to convert eV into units of energy in J.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So,

sigma ≈ (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma = (0.261e15 * 1.602e-19 J) / E_gamma.

But wait, sigma is in m², so perhaps it's better to compute sigma in terms of (eV)^-1 and convert to m².

Wait, another approach: the cross-section for pair production by a gamma and a photon is given by sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1 + cos^2 theta), but since we're considering the average, perhaps sigma_avg ≈ (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (something from the integral).

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with the expression.

So sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (some factor).

But perhaps the factor is (8 pi/3) * (4/3 pi) ) or something. But perhaps for order of magnitude, I can ignore the constants and focus on the scaling.

So sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (proportional factor).

So let's plug in the numbers:

sigma ≈ (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) * (something).

= (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma ) * (something).

But eV is energy, and cross-section is in m². So let's compute this in m².

We know that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, 0.261e15 eV = 0.261e15 * 1.602e-19 J = 4.18e-4 J.

Wait, but sigma must be in m². So perhaps I should compute sigma in terms of eV and c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 1 barn is 1e-28 m², and 1 barn is 1e-24 cm².

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute sigma numerically.

sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ).

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So sigma ≈ 0.261e12 eV² / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV / E_gamma.

But we need sigma in m².

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 0.261e15 eV = 0.261e15 * 1.602e-19 J = 4.178e-4 J.

But J = kg m²/s².

So 4.178e-4 kg m²/s².

So sigma = [4.178e-4 kg m²/s²] / E_gamma (in eV) * [conversion factors].

Wait, perhaps I should better compute sigma in terms of eV and m.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the following approach:

The cross-section sigma has units of area, which in terms of energy is (energy)^{-1} multiplied by some constants.

We can write sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (some constant).

But to get the units correct, let's compute the units.

m_e has units of mass (kg).

c has units of m/s.

E_gamma and E_cmb have units of J (kg m²/s²).

So m_e^2 c^4 has units kg² (m²/s²)^2 = kg² m^4/s^4.

E_gamma E_cmb has units (kg m²/s²)^2 = kg² m^4/s^4.

So sigma = (kg² m^4/s^4) / (kg² m^4/s^4) ) → dimensionless? Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing a factor involving Planck's constant.

Wait, Planck's constant h has units of J s.

In the Klein-Nishina formula, the cross-section involves terms like (m_e c^2)^2 / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) multiplied by h c.

Wait, perhaps I should include h c in the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the cross-section formula I'm using is in natural units and then convert to SI units.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation as follows:

We have t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

We can rearrange this to solve for E_gamma.

But let's compute t in terms of E_gamma.

We have:

t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (some factor), say factor K.

So sigma ≈ K * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb).

So,

t = 1/(n * K * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * c^2 )

= (E_gamma E_cmb) / (n K m_e^2 c^4) ) * (1/c^2).

Wait, let me compute that again.

sigma = K * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb).

So,

t = 1/(n sigma c^2) = 1/(n * K * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * c^2 )

= (E_gamma E_cmb) / (n K m_e^2 c^4 ) * c^2 )

= E_gamma E_cmb / (n K m_e^2 c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me compute it step by step.

t = 1/(n * sigma * c^2 )

= 1/(n * [ K (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ] * c^2 )

= 1/( K n (m_e^2 c^6) / (E_gamma E_cmb) )

= (E_gamma E_cmb) / ( K n m_e^2 c^6 )

But I'm not confident about that. Maybe I should compute sigma in m².

Another approach: use the Klein-Nishina formula for the cross-section. The cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by:

sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) (1 + cos^2(theta)).

But to get sigma in m², we need to convert the units.

m_e c^2 is 0.511e6 eV. So m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 (eV)^2.

E_gamma and E_cmb are in eV.

So sigma = (8 pi/3) * (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) * (1 + cos^2(theta)).

But wait, the units don't make sense. Because sigma should be in m², but this is in eV² / eV = eV. So I must be missing some conversion factor involving the speed of light or Planck's constant.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes factors of c and h. Let me think. The correct formula for the cross-section should have units of area. So perhaps sigma is given by:

sigma = [ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) ] * (something) in m².

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me instead find an expression for the condition where the lifetime is limited by this process.

The condition is that the photon's lifetime t equals the age of the universe, which is roughly 1e10 years. Let's compute t using the expression we have.

t ≈ (E_gamma * E_cmb) / (n sigma c^2 )

But I need to compute sigma correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find E_gamma in terms of t.

Wait, I think I'm making this too complicated. Let's go back to the threshold condition. The minimum energy for pair production is when E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Earlier, I found E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So that's option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

But earlier I thought that the cross-section may have a factor that depends on E_gamma, but perhaps for the purpose of the question, the threshold is when E_gamma is about 2.6e5 GeV.

To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays in the universe is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Condition for Pair Production**:  
   The minimum energy required for the annihilation process to occur is determined by the threshold condition, where the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. The threshold condition is given by:  
   \[
   s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2 \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   For photons, $E = pc$, and assuming head-on collisions for maximum energy transfer, the threshold condition simplifies to:  
   \[
   4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   Rearranging, we find:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

2. **Substitute Known Values**:  
   The electron rest energy is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
   \]  
   Compute $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2$:  
   \[
   (0.511)^2 \approx 0.261, \quad (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2
   \]  
   Divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Convert to GeV:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}, \quad E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The energy threshold for the annihilation process to limit the lifetime of gamma-rays is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. This corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, which is like the afterglow of the Big Bang. The question is about when high-energy gamma-rays interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-.

The problem is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. I think the key here is to find the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime.

Wait, so I need to find the energy where the mean free path of the gamma-ray is such that it can't travel far without annihilating. The lifetime would be limited by the time it takes for the gamma to annihilate, which depends on the cross-section and the density of the CMB photons.

I remember that the cross-section for this process, gamma + photon → e+ e-, depends on the energy of the gamma and the photon. The cross-section σ is proportional to some function of their energies. But wait, I think for high-energy gamma-rays, the cross-section has a specific form. Oh right, I think it's approximately σ ~ (E_cm^2) / (m_e^2), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. Because when E_cm is much larger than the electron mass, the cross-section increases with E_cm squared.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (in the cosmic frame), the spatial part would be (p1 - p2) if they're moving head-on. Wait, no, actually, the CMB photons are isotropic, but the gamma-ray is moving through them. So perhaps we can model this as a head-on collision for the most probable interaction.

Wait, another approach: when a gamma photon interacts with a background photon (like CMB), the threshold condition for pair production is when the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is sufficient to create an electron-positron pair. The threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c², right? Because each particle (e+ and e-) has rest mass m_e.

So the minimum energy needed for the gamma and CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair is when s = (2 m_e c²)^2. So s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (something). Wait, but since photons are massless, their energy is equal to their momentum times c. So for the CMB photon, E_cmb ≈ k c, where k is the wavevector. Similarly, the gamma has E_gamma = p_gamma c.

In the center-of-mass frame, the total energy squared is (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2 cos(theta), but for the maximum possible, theta is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) = -1. Wait, maybe it's better to set the photons moving directly towards each other. So in that case, the total energy is E_gamma + E_cmb, and the total momentum is p_gamma c - p_cmb c. Wait, no, because for photons, the momentum is E/(c) in magnitude, but direction matters.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Assuming they collide head-on, so p2 is opposite to p1. So p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. So p1 c - p2 c would be (p1 + p2) c? Wait, no, because p2 is in the opposite direction, so it's p1 c + p2 c in the same direction. So when you square it, it's (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Wait, let me think again. Photons have momentum p = E/c, but direction matters. So if photon 1 (gamma) is moving in the +x direction, and photon 2 (CMB) is moving in the -x direction, then their momenta are p1 in +x and p2 in -x, so their vectors are p1 = +E1/(c) * x_hat, p2 = -E2/(c) * x_hat.

So the total momentum is p1 + p2 = (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) x_hat.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Wait, because the invariant s is (sum E)^2 - (sum (p c))^2. So sum p c is (p1 c) + (p2 c) = (E1/c * c) + (E2/c * (-c)) * (-1))? Wait, no, the p2 would be in the negative x direction. So p2 c is (-E2/(c)) * c ) = -E2. So sum (p c) is E1 - E2.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding that: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So for the process to be possible, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

We can compute m_e c^2. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so (0.511e6 eV)^2.

Wait, let's compute that. m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

0.511^2 is about 0.261, so 0.261e12 eV².

Now, E_gamma * E_cmb >= 0.261e12 eV².

We know E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, but that seems really high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261 * 1e12) / 1e-3 ) eV.

Which is 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

But wait, 1e14 eV is 1e8 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

So 2.61e14 eV = 261e9 eV = 261 GeV.

But wait, that's 2.61e2 GeV. But the options are much higher, like 1e5 GeV and so on.

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me redo the calculation more carefully.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 eV².

So (m_e c^2)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

Wait, no, wait: (0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * (1e5)^2 = 26.1121 * 1e10 = 2.61121e11 eV².

So E_gamma * E_cmb >= 2.61e11 eV².

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV.

2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait, 2.61e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So E_gamma = approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

But wait, I remember that the cross-section for this process depends on the energy as sigma ~ E_gamma^2. Because in the cross-section formula, for high energies, the cross-section increases with the square of the CM energy. So the cross-section is proportional to sigma ~ (E_cm^2)/(m_e^2). Since E_cm = sqrt(4 E_gamma E_cmb) ≈ 2 sqrt(E_gamma E_cmb), so sigma ~ (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2). 

But wait, the cross-section is also a function of the photon energies. Hmm. The cross-section for pair production by a gamma and a photon scales as sigma ~ (E_cm^2)/(m_e^2) (when E_cm >> m_e) but E_cm is sqrt(4 E_gamma E_cmb), so E_cm^2 is 4 E_gamma E_cmb.

So sigma ~ (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2) * (1/(E_gamma + E_cmb))^2? Or perhaps a different dependence.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section actually scales as sigma ~ (E_gamma^2)/(m_e^2) when the photon energy is much smaller than the gamma's. Because the CMB photon has E_cmb << E_gamma, so E_cmb can be approximated as negligible compared to E_gamma. So then E_cm ≈ sqrt(4 E_gamma E_cmb) ≈ 2 sqrt(E_gamma E_cmb), but if E_gamma >> E_cmb, then E_cm ≈ 2 sqrt(E_gamma E_cmb) ≈ 2 E_cmb (sqrt(E_gamma / E_cmb)).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the annihilation cross-section formula. The cross-section for a gamma and photon to produce an electron-positron pair is given by the Klein-Nishina formula, but I think in the high-energy limit, the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * ... Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to find the expression for the cross-section.

Alternatively, the cross-section for pair production by a gamma and a photon is given by:

sigma ≈ (8 π m_e^2 c^4)/(3 E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1 + cos^2(theta)),

where theta is the angle between the gamma and the CMB photon. The maximum cross-section occurs when theta is 0 (same direction) or 180 (opposite), which gives cos(theta)=±1. So the maximum cross-section is sigma_max ≈ (16 π m_e^2 c^4)/(3 E_gamma E_cmb) ).

But the average is probably a factor, but for the purpose of calculation, maybe using the maximum makes sense, or perhaps the average over angles.

But maybe it's better to model this as the probability of interaction per unit length. The mean free path lambda is 1/(n sigma v), where n is the number density of CMB photons, sigma is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity.

Wait, but since the CMB photons are isotropic, the gamma-ray would have a certain interaction rate. Let me think about the interaction rate approach.

The interaction rate per unit length is R = n * sigma * v_rel, where v_rel is the relative velocity between the gamma and the CMB photon. For photons, since they are massless, their velocity is c, but the relative velocity would depend on their directions.

Alternatively, the mean free path λ is the distance between interactions, so λ ≈ 1/(n sigma c), since each photon is moving at speed c and the number density is n.

The number density n of CMB photons can be found from the CMB photon density. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum with temperature T. The average photon energy is given as E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. For a blackbody, the average photon energy is about 2.7 k_B T, so T ≈ E_cmb/(2.7 k_B).

But wait, the number density n is given by (energy density)/(E_cmb) times a factor. Alternatively, the photon number density in the CMB is n = (energy density) / (average photon energy). The energy density u of the CMB is about 1e-4 erg/cm³. Let me compute that into eV per cm³.

Wait, 1 erg = 1e7 eV, so 1e-4 erg/cm³ = 1e3 eV/cm³. So u = 1e3 eV/cm³.

The average photon energy E_avg is given as 1e-3 eV. So n = u / E_avg = 1e3 eV/cm³ / 1e-3 eV = 1e6 / cm³.

Wait, because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, but perhaps that's not important right now. So n ≈ 1e6 cm^-3.

But wait, actually, the number density of CMB photons is about 411 photons per cm³. Because the CMB is about 2.7 K, and the photon number density is (2.7 K)^3 * (something). Wait, I think the standard number is around 411 photons/cm³. Let me think about that.

The formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody is n = (8 pi g_{\gamma} k_B^3)/(h^3 c^3) * (T^3 / (e^{x} - 1)) ), where x = h c/(k_B T). At T=2.7 K, x is about 0.001 or so, so e^x ≈ 1 + x. But I'm not sure about the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the photon energy density u = 411 photons/cm³ * average energy of 1e-3 eV. Wait, if the average energy is 1e-3 eV per photon, and number density is 411 per cm³, then the energy density is 411 * 1e-3 eV = 0.411 eV/cm³. But earlier I thought the energy density is about 1e3 eV/cm³. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's get the actual CMB photon number density. The CMB temperature is T ≈ 2.7 K. The number density of photons is given by n = (2ζ(3)/π^2) * (k_B T)^3 / (h c)^3 ) * (g_{\gamma} ), where g_{\gamma} is the degrees of freedom, which is 2 for photons.

But wait, the formula is n = (2 g_{\gamma})/ (h^3 c^3) ) * (k_B T)^3 * (4 pi) / (ζ(3)).

Wait, perhaps I should just look it up, but since I can't do that right now, I'll approximate. At T=2.7 K, the number density is about 411 cm^-3. So n ≈ 4e2 cm^-3.

But earlier, when I thought that the energy density u is 1e-4 erg/cm³, which is 1e3 eV/cm³. So 411 photons/cm³ * 1e-3 eV/photon = 0.411 eV/cm³, which is less than 1e3 eV/cm³. So perhaps the energy density is 1e3 eV/cm³, which would imply that the average photon energy is 1e3 eV / 411 photons/cm³ ≈ 2.4 eV. But the question says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So perhaps the universe's CMB has an average photon energy of 1e-3 eV. That would imply a temperature T where (k_B T) ≈ 1e-3 eV.

Compute T: 1e-3 eV = k_B T. k_B is about 8.617e-5 eV/K. So T = (1e-3 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 11.6 K. Wait, but the CMB is about 2.7 K. So maybe the problem is hypothetical, and the average photon energy is given, so perhaps I should proceed with that value.

So given that E_cmb = 1e-3 eV, and the number density n is u / E_avg. Let's compute u.

The energy density u of the CMB is roughly 1e-4 erg/cm³. Converting to eV: 1 erg = 1e7 eV, so 1e-4 erg = 1e3 eV. So u = 1e3 eV/cm³.

So n = u / E_avg = 1e3 eV/cm³ / 1e-3 eV = 1e6 cm^-3.

Wait, that's 1e6 photons/cm³, which seems high. Because the CMB is much less dense. So perhaps the given average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, but the energy density is about 1e-4 erg/cm³ (which is 1e3 eV/cm³), so n = 1e3 eV/cm³ / 1e-3 eV = 1e6 photons/cm³. Hmm, that's 1e6 per cm³, which is 1e12 per m³. That's a lot, but maybe in this problem's context, it's given.

So the number density n is 1e6 cm^-3.

Now, the cross-section sigma for gamma + photon → e+ e- is given by the formula:

sigma ≈ (8 π/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) (1 + cos^2(theta)).

But since the CMB photons are isotropic, we can average over all angles. The average value of (1+cos^2 theta) is (2/3)(1 + 1) ) because the average of 1 + cos^2(theta) over a sphere is 2/3 * (some factor). Wait, the integral of (1 + cos^2 theta) over all solid angles is:

Integral = ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta dtheta dphi from 0 to pi, 0 to 2pi.

Let me compute it. The integral over phi is 2 pi. The integral over theta is ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta from 0 to pi.

Let u = cos theta, du = - sin theta d theta. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 + u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1. So it's ∫ (1+u²) du from -1 to 1.

Which is [u + (u^3)/3 ] from -1 to 1. Plugging in:

(1 + 1/3) - (-1 - 1/3) ) = (4/3) - (-4/3) )= 8/3.

So the total integral is 2 pi * 8/3 = (16/3) pi.

So the average value of (1 + cos^2 theta) is (16/3 pi) ) / (4 pi) ) = (16/3)/(4) )= 4/3.

Wait, no, the average is [Integral (1 + cos^2 theta) d Omega ] / (4 pi).

So the average is (16 pi/3) ) / (4 pi) ) = 4/3.

So average sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (4/3) * (1/(4 pi)) )? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average cross-section.

Wait, the cross-section is sigma(theta) = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) (1 + cos^2 theta).

The average cross-section is sigma_avg = (1/(4 pi)) ∫ sigma(theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

The integral over phi is 2 pi. The integral over theta is ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta from 0 to pi, which is 8/3 as before.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) * (2 pi) * (8/3) ).

Wait, let me compute that step by step. The integral over theta is 8/3. The integral over phi is 2 pi. So the total integral is 2 pi * 8/3 = 16 pi/3.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. The expression should be:

sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4/(E_gamma E_cmb)) * (1/(4 pi)) * ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

So the integrals are 2 pi * (8/3) = 16 pi/3.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4/(E_gamma E_cmb)) ) * (1/(4 pi)) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, that seems complicated. Let's compute it.

sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the average cross-section from the integral.

Wait,

sigma_avg = (8 pi /3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * ∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

Compute the integral:

∫ (1 + cos^2 theta) sin theta d theta d phi from theta 0 to pi, phi 0 to 2 pi.

As before, the integral is (16/3) pi.

So sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Wait, so putting it all together:

sigma_avg = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1/(4 pi)) ) * (16 pi/3).

Compute that:

(8 pi/3) * (1/(4 pi)) ) = (8 pi)/(3 *4 pi) ) = 2/(3).

Then multiply by (16 pi/3):

2/3 * (16 pi/3) ) = (32 pi)/(9).

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the average cross-section. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section scales as sigma ~ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ). So for the purposes of finding the energy where the lifetime is limited, perhaps we can model sigma as proportional to 1/(E_gamma * E_cmb), since E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV.

So the cross-section sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ).

But wait, the exact formula may have other factors, but for order of magnitude, this should suffice.

Now, the interaction rate is R = n sigma v, where v is the relative velocity between the gamma and the CMB photon. Since both are moving at speed c, but in opposite directions for maximum effect, their relative speed is 2c. Wait, but photons have velocity c in their own frames. Hmm, perhaps the relative velocity in the lab frame is c (gamma moving) and photon moving in opposite direction, so their relative velocity is 2c, but that's a big number. However, in the cross-section formula, the velocity is incorporated. Wait, perhaps the cross-section already accounts for the relative velocity, so the interaction rate is R = n sigma c, because the gamma is moving at speed c, and the CMB photons are isotropic, so the relative speed is c for each photon.

Wait, more accurately, the interaction rate is given by R = n sigma c, where c is the speed of the gamma-ray. Because the gamma is moving with speed c, and the CMB photons are at rest in the cosmic frame, but their number density is n. So each CMB photon is moving, but on average, the interaction rate is proportional to n sigma c.

So the mean free path is lambda = 1/(n sigma c).

The lifetime t is related to the distance traveled as t = lambda / (gamma's speed), which is c. So t = lambda / c = 1/(n sigma c^2).

Wait, no. Because the mean free path is the average distance before an interaction. So if the gamma travels a distance L, the probability of interaction is 1 - e^{-L/lambda} ≈ L/lambda for small L. So the lifetime without interaction is when L ≈ lambda, which is L = c t.

So lambda = c t.

But the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by how long it takes to interact, so the interaction time is t = 1/(n sigma c).

Wait, let me think again.

The mean free path lambda is the average distance a gamma travels before interacting. So, the time taken to travel lambda is t = lambda / c.

Lambda is 1/(n sigma c), because R = n sigma c (interaction rate per unit length). So lambda = 1/(n sigma c).

Thus, t = lambda / c = 1/(n sigma c^2).

So the lifetime is t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

We want to find the gamma-ray energy E_gamma where this process becomes significant, i.e., where the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So perhaps when the age of the universe is approximately equal to t, but I think the problem is more about when the interaction rate is such that the gamma cannot propagate without annihilating, so the energy where the mean free path is comparable to the size of the universe.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is when the photon's lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe, which is about 1e10 years. But perhaps the problem is more about the energy where the interaction rate becomes so high that the photon's lifetime is limited, so the energy where the photon cannot travel large distances without annihilating.

But perhaps the key point is to find when the photon's lifetime t is approximately the age of the universe. Let's compute t.

t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

We have n = 1e6 cm^-3 = 1e6 / (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e6 / 1e-6 m^3 = 1e12 m^-3.

But wait, actually, 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3. Because 1 cm = 1e-2 m, so 1 cm^3 = (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e-6 m^3. So 1 cm^-3 = 1e6 m^-3.

So n = 1e6 cm^-3 = 1e6 * 1e6 m^-3 = 1e12 m^-3.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 cm^3 is (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e-6 m^3. So 1 cm^-3 is 1 m^3 / 1e-6 m^3 = 1e6 m^-3. So 1e6 cm^-3 is 1e6 * 1e6 m^-3 = 1e12 m^-3.

So n = 1e12 m^-3.

Now, sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ).

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV².

So sigma ≈ (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma.

But wait, E_gamma is in eV.

So sigma ≈ (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma.

But E_gamma is in eV, so sigma has units of eV which is wrong for a cross-section. Oh wait, no, cross-section has units of area, which is in m² or barns (1 barn = 1e-28 m²). Let me check the units.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in compatible units.

Let me compute sigma in m².

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

E_gamma is in eV.

So sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb).

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

E_gamma * E_cmb = E_gamma * 1e-3 eV.

So sigma ≈ (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) = (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma.

But sigma must be in m². So I need to convert eV into units of energy in J.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So,

sigma ≈ (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma = (0.261e15 * 1.602e-19 J) / E_gamma.

But wait, sigma is in m², so perhaps it's better to compute sigma in terms of (eV)^-1 and convert to m².

Wait, another approach: the cross-section for pair production by a gamma and a photon is given by sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (1 + cos^2 theta), but since we're considering the average, perhaps sigma_avg ≈ (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (something from the integral).

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with the expression.

So sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (some factor).

But perhaps the factor is (8 pi/3) * (4/3 pi) ) or something. But perhaps for order of magnitude, I can ignore the constants and focus on the scaling.

So sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (proportional factor).

So let's plug in the numbers:

sigma ≈ (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) * (something).

= (0.261e15 eV) / E_gamma ) * (something).

But eV is energy, and cross-section is in m². So let's compute this in m².

We know that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, 0.261e15 eV = 0.261e15 * 1.602e-19 J = 4.18e-4 J.

Wait, but sigma must be in m². So perhaps I should compute sigma in terms of eV and c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 1 barn is 1e-28 m², and 1 barn is 1e-24 cm².

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute sigma numerically.

sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ).

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6)^2 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So sigma ≈ 0.261e12 eV² / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV / E_gamma.

But we need sigma in m².

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 0.261e15 eV = 0.261e15 * 1.602e-19 J = 4.178e-4 J.

But J = kg m²/s².

So 4.178e-4 kg m²/s².

So sigma = [4.178e-4 kg m²/s²] / E_gamma (in eV) * [conversion factors].

Wait, perhaps I should better compute sigma in terms of eV and m.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the following approach:

The cross-section sigma has units of area, which in terms of energy is (energy)^{-1} multiplied by some constants.

We can write sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (some constant).

But to get the units correct, let's compute the units.

m_e has units of mass (kg).

c has units of m/s.

E_gamma and E_cmb have units of J (kg m²/s²).

So m_e^2 c^4 has units kg² (m²/s²)^2 = kg² m^4/s^4.

E_gamma E_cmb has units (kg m²/s²)^2 = kg² m^4/s^4.

So sigma = (kg² m^4/s^4) / (kg² m^4/s^4) ) → dimensionless? Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing a factor involving Planck's constant.

Wait, Planck's constant h has units of J s.

In the Klein-Nishina formula, the cross-section involves terms like (m_e c^2)^2 / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) multiplied by h c.

Wait, perhaps I should include h c in the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the cross-section formula I'm using is in natural units and then convert to SI units.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation as follows:

We have t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

We can rearrange this to solve for E_gamma.

But let's compute t in terms of E_gamma.

We have:

t = 1/(n sigma c^2).

sigma ≈ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * (some factor), say factor K.

So sigma ≈ K * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb).

So,

t = 1/(n * K * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) * c^2 )

= (E_gamma E_cmb) / (n K m_e^2 c^4) ) * (1/c^2).

Wait, let me compute that again.

sigma = K * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb).

So,

t = 1/(n sigma c^2) = 1/(n * K * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ) * c^2 )

= (E_gamma E_cmb) / (n K m_e^2 c^4 ) * c^2 )

= E_gamma E_cmb / (n K m_e^2 c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me compute it step by step.

t = 1/(n * sigma * c^2 )

= 1/(n * [ K (m_e^2 c^4)/(E_gamma E_cmb) ] * c^2 )

= 1/( K n (m_e^2 c^6) / (E_gamma E_cmb) )

= (E_gamma E_cmb) / ( K n m_e^2 c^6 )

But I'm not confident about that. Maybe I should compute sigma in m².

Another approach: use the Klein-Nishina formula for the cross-section. The cross-section for photon-photon pair production is given by:

sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) (1 + cos^2(theta)).

But to get sigma in m², we need to convert the units.

m_e c^2 is 0.511e6 eV. So m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 (eV)^2.

E_gamma and E_cmb are in eV.

So sigma = (8 pi/3) * (0.261e12 eV²) / (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) ) * (1 + cos^2(theta)).

But wait, the units don't make sense. Because sigma should be in m², but this is in eV² / eV = eV. So I must be missing some conversion factor involving the speed of light or Planck's constant.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes factors of c and h. Let me think. The correct formula for the cross-section should have units of area. So perhaps sigma is given by:

sigma = [ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma E_cmb) ) ] * (something) in m².

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me instead find an expression for the condition where the lifetime is limited by this process.

The condition is that the photon's lifetime t equals the age of the universe, which is roughly 1e10 years. Let's compute t using the expression we have.

t ≈ (E_gamma * E_cmb) / (n sigma c^2 )

But I need to compute sigma correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find E_gamma in terms of t.

Wait, I think I'm making this too complicated. Let's go back to the threshold condition. The minimum energy for pair production is when E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Earlier, I found E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So that's option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

But earlier I thought that the cross-section may have a factor that depends on E_gamma, but perhaps for the purpose of the question, the threshold is when E_gamma is about 2.6e5 GeV.


To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays in the universe is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Condition for Pair Production**:  
   The minimum energy required for the annihilation process to occur is determined by the threshold condition, where the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. The threshold condition is given by:  
   \[
   s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2 \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   For photons, $E = pc$, and assuming head-on collisions for maximum energy transfer, the threshold condition simplifies to:  
   \[
   4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   Rearranging, we find:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

2. **Substitute Known Values**:  
   The electron rest energy is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
   \]  
   Compute $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2$:  
   \[
   (0.511)^2 \approx 0.261, \quad (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2
   \]  
   Divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Convert to GeV:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}, \quad E_\gamma \geq 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The energy threshold for the annihilation process to limit the lifetime of gamma-rays is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. This corresponds to option **C**.
