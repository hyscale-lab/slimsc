Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, actually, I think I misread that. Let me check again. Oh right, it's (a divided by the square root of (1 plus x)) minus 0.5 times i. So the wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

But wait, wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, so having an imaginary part makes sense. But typically, the square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density. Oh, right, because the probability density is |Ψ(x)|².

The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So that means the probability of finding the particle is zero outside this interval. Therefore, the wave function must satisfy the boundary conditions such that the probability is zero beyond x=1 and x=3.

So, the wave function must be zero at x=1 and x=3. Wait, no, no. Wait, because the wave function isn't necessarily zero at the boundaries unless it's a bound state. Hmm, but in this problem, the region where the particle exists is between 1 and 3, so maybe the wave function is zero beyond that. Or perhaps the wave function is zero at the boundaries because that's when the particle is found. Wait, no, the wave function being zero at certain points would make it a node, but here, the particle is only found between 1 and 3, so the probability should be zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the absolute square of this. 

The absolute value squared is Ψ*(x) Ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate. So, Ψ*(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying that by Ψ(x), which is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, gives:

(a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) + (a/sqrt(1+x))*(0.5i)

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. 

When you multiply (A + Bi)(A - Bi), you get A² + B². Because the cross terms (the Bi * (-Bi)) would be -B² i², and since i² is -1, it becomes + B². So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. 

So, |Ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1 + x)) + 0.25.

Now, the question is about the normalization. The total probability must be 1, so the integral of |Ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. 

First, split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so evaluated from 1 to 3. So it becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So, a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Take the square root of that: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\Psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\Psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability must be normalized to 1, so we integrate \( |\Psi(x)|^2 \) over the region \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral splits into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So, a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Take the square root of that: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.
