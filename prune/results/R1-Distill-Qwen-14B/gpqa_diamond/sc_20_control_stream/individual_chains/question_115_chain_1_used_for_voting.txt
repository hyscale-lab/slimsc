Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions. The options are numbers, so I suppose the answer is one of those.

First, let's recap what I know. Electrons and positrons are matter and antimatter, so when they annihilate, they produce energy, which in this case is two photons. Since they're annihilating, their rest mass energy should be converted into the photons' energy. But wait, they're each moving, so their total energy isn't just their rest mass energy; it's more because of their kinetic energy, which is accounted for by the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the electron, gamma is 4, and the positron has gamma 2. So their total energies are gamma times their rest mass energy.

But wait, since an electron and a positron are each other's antiparticles, their rest masses are equal. So the rest mass energy is the same for both. Let me denote m_e as the electron mass. So the electron's energy is gamma_e * m_e c², and the positron's energy is gamma_p * m_e c².

So the total energy before annihilation is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c². Since they annihilate into two photons, the total energy of the photons should be equal to that. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, each having E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c² / 2. Because 2 photons each with E would sum to 2E, so E must be half the total.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The rest mass energy of an electron and positron is 2 m_e c², right? Because each has m_e c². So when they annihilate, they produce at least that energy. But since they're moving, their kinetic energy adds to the rest mass energy, so the total energy is more.

So each photon's energy comes from (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m_e c². So the sum of their energies is (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c². But each photon's energy is half of that, so 3 m_e c² each. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says each photon has the same energy. So the sum is twice the energy of one photon. So 2E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c². Therefore, E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p)/2 * m_e c².

Wait, but gamma for the electron is 4, gamma for the positron is 2. So gamma_e + gamma_p is 6. So E_photon is 6/2 * m_e c² = 3 m_e c². So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Wait, but that can't be right, because the rest mass energy is 2 m_e c². So each photon's energy is 3 m_e c², which is more than the rest mass. But that's possible because they have kinetic energy.

Now, the next thing is that the photons are emitted in opposite directions? No, wait: problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So they are moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction? Or perhaps one is upper-right and the other lower-right, meaning their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis.

Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and the positron from the right. So they're moving towards each other along the same line, which is the horizontal axis. So their initial momenta are along that axis.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. The photons have the same energy and are emitted in upper-right and lower-right directions. So each photon is moving at some angle above and below the horizontal axis, but both in the right direction. So their directions are symmetric about the horizontal axis.

Wait, but if that's the case, their momenta would have components in the horizontal and vertical directions. Since photons carry momentum, the total momentum of the system must be conserved, both before and after the collision.

So, let's think about conservation of momentum. Before collision, the total momentum is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Since they're moving along the same line (horizontal axis), let's compute their momenta.

The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e v_p, but since it's moving from the right to the left (wait, the positron is moving from the right towards the left, same as the electron moving from left to right? Wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so same direction as the electron? Or opposite?

Wait, the problem says: an electron is moving from the left along the horizontal, and the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So the electron is moving to the right, positron is moving to the left, right? Because from the left, moving to the right. From the right, moving to the left. So they are moving towards each other.

Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so direction is to the left. So they're moving towards each other along the same line. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait: if the electron is moving from left to right, its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta.

Wait, let me write that. Let me set up coordinate system: x-axis is horizontal, y-axis vertical.

Electron (e-) is moving along +x direction with gamma_e =4. Positron (e+) is moving along -x direction with gamma_p=2.

So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Momentum of e- is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

Similarly, momentum of e+ is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

But since they are moving in opposite directions, we can take the positron's momentum as negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but we don't know the velocities yet. Hmm. Alternatively, since gamma relates velocity, perhaps we can express velocities in terms of gamma.

We can find the velocities from gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute v_e and v_p.

For the electron (gamma_e=4):

gamma_e = 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)

So 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/(gamma_e²) = 1/16.

So v_e² = c² (1 - 1/16) = (15/16) c².

v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, positron's gamma_p =2.

gamma_p=2: 1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) =2.

So sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) = 1/2.

So 1 - v_p²/c² = 1/4 → v_p² = c² (3/4) → v_p = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866 c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is -v_p.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e c * sqrt(15).

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p) = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait a second. Because the positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, so its momentum is negative. So adding p_e (positive) and p_p (negative) gives the net initial momentum.

Wait, but wait: actually, the positron's velocity is along the negative x direction, so the magnitude of its momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative.

So p_initial = p_e (positive) + p_p (negative) = 4 m_e v_e - 2 m_e v_p.

Wait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p (but v_p is in -x direction, so v_p is negative). So p_p is negative.

So, let me compute it numerically.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e c sqrt(15).

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p) = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm.

Now, after annihilation, the system is two photons. Each photon has energy E_photon = 3 m_e c². Because, as earlier, the total energy is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c² = (4+2) m_e c² =6 m_e c². Each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum is E/c, because for photons, E = pc c. So p = E/(c).

So each photon has momentum 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c.

So each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c.

But their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So let's model their momenta vectors.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1: direction is upper-right. So its momentum vector is p1 = (p1x, p1y), where p1x is positive (right direction), p1y positive (upper).

Photon 2: direction is lower-right. So p2x is positive, p2y is negative.

The total momentum after annihilation is the sum of p1 and p2.

Because momentum is conserved, the total after must equal the total before.

So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction, and zero in the y-direction.

Wait, but wait. Because the initial system's momentum is along the x-axis, so after the collision, the total momentum in the y-direction must be zero.

So p1y + p2y =0.

Which implies that p2y = - p1y.

So the y-components of the photons' momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That makes sense because if the photons are symmetric about the x-axis, their y-components cancel out.

Now, let's denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis as theta1 and theta2.

Photon 1: angle theta1 above the x-axis.

Photon 2: angle theta2 below the x-axis.

Since their y-components are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, and their x-components are in the same direction (right), we can model their momenta.

Each photon's momentum is a vector with magnitude 3 m_e c.

So for photon 1:

p1x = 3 m_e c cos(theta1)

p1y = 3 m_e c sin(theta1)

Photon 2:

p2x = 3 m_e c cos(theta2)

p2y = -3 m_e c sin(theta2) → because it's in the opposite y-direction.

But since the system's total y-momentum must be zero, we have:

p1y + p2y = 0 → 3 m_e c sin(theta1) - 3 m_e c sin(theta2) =0 → sin(theta1) = sin(theta2).

But since theta1 is above x-axis and theta2 is below, sin(theta1) = sin(theta2) implies that theta2 = 180 - theta1, but wait, that can't be because they are both in the right direction. Wait, no, because their angles are measured from the x-axis. So for photon 2, the angle is negative theta1 perhaps? Or maybe the same in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but in any case, the sines must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that theta2 = - theta1, but that would make their y-components opposite. Wait, let me think.

Suppose theta1 is the angle above the x-axis, then theta2 would be the same angle below, so theta2 = -theta1.

In that case, sin(theta2) = -sin(theta1).

So p1y = 3 m_e c sin(theta1), p2y=3 m_e c sin(theta2)=3 m_e c (-sin(theta1)).

So their sum would be zero, as required.

Thus, the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis.

Now, considering the x-component of the total momentum.

p_initial x-component is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The total x-component after collision is p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c [cos(theta1) + cos(theta2)].

But since theta2 is -theta1, cos(theta2) = cos(theta1), so:

p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta1) ] = 6 m_e c cos(theta1).

So setting this equal to p_initial:

6 m_e c cos(theta1) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

We can cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos(theta1) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta1) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6.

Let me compute that numerically.

Compute sqrt(15): approx 3.872.

sqrt(3): approx 1.732.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14.

Divide by 6: 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So cos(theta1) ≈ 0.3567.

So theta1 ≈ arccos(0.3567). Let me compute that.

Arccos(0.3567) is around 69 degrees. Let me check using a calculator:

cos(60°)=0.5, cos(70°)= approx 0.3420.

Because 0.3567 is between 0.3420 and 0.5, so theta1 is between 60 and 70. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.3567:

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584.

Wait, 69 degrees: 69 × π/180 ≈ 1.204 radians.

cos(1.204) ≈ 0.3584.

0.3584 is a bit higher than 0.3567, so maybe 69 degrees is a bit higher. Let's compute for 69.5 degrees:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the exact value. But alternatively, let's proceed with the approximate angle.

So theta1 is approximately 69 degrees above the x-axis, and theta2 is 69 degrees below.

Now, the angle between the two photons is theta1 - (-theta2) = theta1 + theta2. Wait, no. Wait, the direction of photon 1 is theta1 above x, and photon 2 is theta2 below x. So the angle between them is theta1 + theta2. Since theta2 is same as theta1 in magnitude but opposite in sign, the angle between them is 2*theta1.

So the angle is 2 * 69 degrees ≈ 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's check the calculation again.

Wait, let me recheck the exact calculation.

We have cos(theta1) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

Compute the exact value:

sqrt(15) = 3.872983346, sqrt(3) = 1.732050808.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 = 2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 ≈ 0.3568220897.

So cos(theta1) ≈ 0.35682209.

Now, arccos(0.35682209) is approximately 69 degrees, right?

Wait, cos(69 degrees) is approximately 0.3584, as I thought before.

Wait, but 0.3568 is a bit less than 0.3584, meaning theta1 is a bit larger than 69 degrees.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute using calculator:

theta1 = arccos(0.35682209).

Using a calculator, let's compute it.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator function here.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is around 69 degrees, leading to the total angle being 138 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 * theta1 ≈ 138 degrees.

Which is option C.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons of equal energy. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, while the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. The photons are emitted symmetrically about the horizontal axis, one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The goal is to determine the angle between the two photons.

### Step 1: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the Lorentz factor, the electron's momentum is:

\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e c = 4 m_e c
\]

The positron's momentum is:

\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e c = 2 m_e c
\]

Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative. Thus, the total initial momentum is:

\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = 4 m_e c - 2 m_e c = 2 m_e c
\]

### Step 2: Momentum of the Photons
After annihilation, the two photons have equal energy and are emitted symmetrically about the horizontal axis. Each photon has energy:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{\text{Total energy}}{2} = \frac{(\gamma_e + \gamma_p) m_e c^2}{2} = \frac{6 m_e c^2}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
\]

For photons, energy and momentum are related by \( E = pc \), so the momentum of each photon is:

\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Symmetry and Angle Between Photons
The photons are emitted symmetrically about the horizontal axis. Let the angles of the photons with respect to the horizontal axis be \( \theta \) above and below the axis, respectively. The total momentum in the vertical direction must cancel out, implying:

\[
p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0
\]

This symmetry ensures that the y-components of the photons' momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The x-components of the photons' momenta add up to conserve total momentum:

\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x}
\]

Using \( p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c \), the x-components are:

\[
p_{1x} = 3 m_e c \cos(\theta), \quad p_{2x} = 3 m_e c \cos(\theta)
\]

Thus, the total x-momentum after annihilation is:

\[
p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 6 m_e c \cos(\theta)
\]

Equating this to the total initial momentum:

\[
6 m_e c \cos(\theta) = 2 m_e c
\]

Canceling \( m_e c \) from both sides:

\[
6 \cos(\theta) = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus:

\[
\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx 70.5288^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The angle between the two photons is twice the angle \( \theta \), as one photon is emitted above the horizontal axis and the other below:

\[
\text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 70.5288^\circ \approx 141.06^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Closest Option
The closest option to \( 141.06^\circ \) is \( 138^\circ \).
