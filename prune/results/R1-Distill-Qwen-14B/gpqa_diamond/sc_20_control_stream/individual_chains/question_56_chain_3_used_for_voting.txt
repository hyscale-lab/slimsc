Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by selection rules, especially for dipole transitions.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are: delta l (the change in angular momentum) can be ±1, and delta m (the change in magnetic quantum number) can be 0, ±1. Also, the n (principal quantum number) can change by any integer, but in practice, it's usually adjacent levels since higher jumps are less probable, but the question says two dipole transitions so it's definitely two steps.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It needs to decay to n=1, l=0, m=0, but via two transitions. So each step must follow the selection rules.

Let me think about the possible intermediate states. From (3,0,0), the first transition can go to some (n', l', m'). Since l=0, the next l' must be l±1, so l' can be 1. So the first step must go to l=1.

What about the possible m values? Starting from m=0, the next m can be -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could have m=0, ±1. And the principal quantum number n can change by ±1 in each step. So from n=3, first transition could go to n=2 or n=4. But since we're going to n=1 in two steps, probably the first transition is from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1.

Wait, but wait, if the first transition is 3→2, that's a change in n by -1. Then the second can be 2→1, which is another -1 change. So two transitions each with n decreasing by 1.

So the intermediate state has n=2, l=1. So possible m values are -1, 0, +1. But the initial state has m=0, so in the first transition, m can go to m=0±1 or stay the same. So possible m' for the first step are -1, 0, +1. But the initial state is |3,0,0>, so m starts at 0. So first transition to |2,1, m> where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but for the first transition, the selection rule allows m to change by 0 or ±1. So the first state could be |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1, +1>.

Then the second transition must take this to |1,0,0>. So from |2,1, m>, what can happen?

Again, applying selection rules. For the second transition, from n=2 to n=1 (delta n = -1), l=1 to l=0 (delta l = -1), which is allowed because l changes by ±1. And m must change by 0 or ±1. So let's see each possibility.

If the intermediate state is |2,1, m>, what m can it have to allow transition to |1,0,0>.

From |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>, so delta m must be 0 - m. So delta m = -m. But delta m must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for the second transition:

m must change by exactly -m, but that delta m must be one of -1, 0, +1.

Wait, no. The delta m for the second transition is (m_final - m_initial). Wait, no, the delta m is what the transition can change. So m_final = m_initial + delta m. So in the second transition, m_final is 0. So from the intermediate state, which is |2,1, m>, the transition must have delta m = (0 - m). So delta m must be such that m + delta m = 0. So delta m = -m.

But delta m can only be 0, ±1. So possible only if -m is in {0, ±1}. So m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, let me think again. The second transition is from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>. So delta l is -1 (allowed), delta n is -1 (allowed). The delta m must be 0 - m, which must be either -1, 0, or +1.

So 0 - m = delta m ∈ {-1, 0, +1}. So 0 - m = either -1, 0, or +1. Therefore, m can be 1, 0, or -1.

Wait, let me correct that. The delta m is (m_final - m_initial). So m_final is 0. So delta m = 0 - m. So delta m can be -m, and it must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for delta m to be in those values, m can be 0, ±1.

Because:

If m = 0: delta m = 0. Which is allowed.

If m = 1: delta m = -1. Which is allowed.

If m = -1: delta m = +1. Also allowed.

So any intermediate state with m = 0, 1, or -1 can transition to m=0. So all three possibilities for the first transition's m are acceptable.

But wait, considering the first transition from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m= m1.

So the possible m1 values are -1, 0, +1.

So for each of these, the second transition can proceed to m=0.

So the possible transition paths are:

(3,0,0) → (2,1, m1), then (2,1, m1) → (1,0,0), for m1 = -1, 0, +1.

So for each possible m1, the path is allowed.

But the question is about the probability. The options have different probability fractions, so we need to compute which path is more probable.

Wait, but why would the probabilities differ? Maybe because the transition dipole moment depends on the matrix elements, which may be zero or non-zero.

Oh right, the transition dipole moment determines the probability. If the matrix element is zero, the transition doesn't occur. So not all m1 are allowed in the first step, or in the second.

Wait, but no, because I thought the selection rules allow for m changes of 0, ±1. So the selection rules are satisfied for all three m1 values. But perhaps the matrix elements are non-zero only for some.

Wait, so the dipole transition matrix element is given by:

⟨f| r |i⟩, where f is the final state.

In spherical coordinates, r can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. The matrix element involves integrals of Y_{l', m'}* Y_{1, q} Y_{l, m}. So the integral is zero unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, the dipole operator has angular momentum components proportional to Y_{1, m} with m = -1, 0, +1. So the selection rule for m is delta m = 0, ±1, but the actual integrals may vanish for some cases.

Wait, more accurately, the matrix element is non-zero only if the product of the spherical harmonics allows for the integral to be non-zero. The integral ∫ Y_{l', m'}* Y_{1, m} Y_{l, m} dΩ is zero unless certain conditions are met.

The selection rules are that for the dipole transition, the change in m can be 0, ±1. But when you have l and l' such that |l - l'| ≤ 1 ≤ l + l', which is already satisfied here because from l=0 to l=1.

Wait, maybe the key is that when going from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m1>, the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for specific m1.

Similarly, when going from |2,1, m1> to |1,0,0>, the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for specific m1.

So for the first transition, |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>, the matrix element will be non-zero only when m1 = 0 ±1, which are -1, 0, +1, which is all possible. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, the initial state has m=0, and the dipole operator has m components of -1, 0, +1. So the dipole operator can cause a change in m of -1, 0, +1. So the possible m1's are 0-1, 0, 0+1 → -1, 0, +1.

So all three m1 are possible in the first transition. But their matrix elements vary.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to rY_{1,m}, so the matrix element ⟨2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only when m1 = m (since the initial m is 0) plus the m from Y_{1,m}. So m1 = 0 + m, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but in the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0> with m=0. So the dipole operator's m component determines the change in m. So for the first transition, the possible m1's are 0 + (-1)= -1, 0 + 0=0, and 0 +1= +1. So all three are allowed.

So the first transition can go to |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1, +1>.

But then, in the second transition, from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the dipole operator can cause a change in m of -1, 0, +1. So for each m1, what's the possible delta m.

Wait, the second transition must have m change from m1 to 0. So delta m = 0 - m1. So for the second transition, delta m must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for each m1:

If m1 = 0: delta m = 0 → allowed.

If m1 = +1: delta m = -1 → allowed.

If m1 = -1: delta m = +1 → allowed.

So all three possibilities are allowed.

But wait, the matrix elements for these transitions may not all be the same. So the probability depends on the square of the matrix elements. So perhaps some transitions are more probable than others.

So let's think about the first transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>.

The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or something similar.

Alternatively, for the dipole transition, the probability can be found using the Wigner-Eckart theorem.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m1| r |3,0,0⟩.

But r is proportional to Y_{1,0} (I think, because the dipole operator has components along Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1, +1} corresponding to the x, y, z components). Wait, no, the dipole operator is given in terms of Cartesian components. For example, the electric dipole moment has components like e x Y_{1,1} + e y Y_{1,-1} + e z Y_{1,0} (or something like that). So each component of the dipole operator can cause a change in m by 1, 0, or -1, respectively.

But perhaps for our purposes, the key is that the matrix element ⟨2,1, m1| r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero, and the transition is allowed for m1 = -1, 0, +1.

But the question is about the probabilities, so which of these m1 is more probable.

Wait, perhaps the selection rule for the transition is that the matrix element is non-zero when certain conditions are met beyond just delta m.

Wait, the Wigner-Eckart theorem says that the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is zero unless specific angular momentum conditions are met.

In the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has angular momentum 1 (since it's an electric dipole). So the product of the dipole operator (l=1) and initial state (l=0) must combine to the final state (l=1). So the coupling happens as 0 (initial l) +1 (dipole) → 1 (final l).

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is non-zero only when m_final = m_initial + m_dipole.

In our case, initial m is 0, dipole m can be -1, 0, +1. So the final m can be -1, 0, +1.

So all three are allowed.

But the matrix element's magnitude may differ. So perhaps the transition to m1=0 has a higher probability than others.

Wait, how does the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient affect the magnitude?

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (s state) with l=1 (p state) to get l=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are:

⟨ l', m' | l, m; 1, m_dipole ⟩.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the general expression for the matrix element. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the same for each of the m1 = -1, 0, +1 in the first transition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the matrix element for the dipole transition would involve the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{l', m'} Y_{l, m_initial}^*. For l=0, Y_0^0 is a constant, so the integral reduces to Y_{1,m} Y_{l', m'}, integrated over all angles. So the integral is non-zero only if m' = m + m_initial. Since initial m is 0, m' is just m.

Thus, the matrix element is non-zero only for m' = m, where m is -1, 0, +1. So the first transition can go to m1= -1, 0, +1.

But the magnitude may differ, so perhaps the transition probabilities are different.

Wait, for the dipole operator, the components are proportional to Y_{1, m}, m = -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{2,1, m1}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{3,0, 0}.

Since Y_{3,0,0} is a constant, the integral becomes Y_{2,1, m1}^* Y_{1,m}.

The integral of Y_{l=2,m1}^* Y_{l=1,m} is zero unless m1 = m ± something? Or perhaps it's non-zero only when certain conditions hold.

Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫ Y_{2,m1}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{1, m'} dΩ is non-zero if m1 = m + m', and if |2-1| ≤ 1 ≤ 2+1, which is 1 ≤1 ≤3. So l=1 is allowed. So the integral is non-zero for m1 = m + m'.

Wait, but in our case, the integral is Y_{2,m1}^* Y_{1,m} (since Y_0^0 is 1, so it doesn't affect the product). So the integral is non-zero only if m1 = m (since Y_{1, m} is being multiplied by Y_{2,m1}^* and 1). So the integral is zero unless m1 = m.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>, so its Y is Y_{0,0}.

The matrix element is ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* (Y_{1, m}) Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so it's a constant.

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{l',m'}^* Y_{l,m} dΩ is zero unless l' = l ±1, which isn't the case here since 2 and 1 is a difference of 1, which is allowed. Wait, 2-1=1, which is allowed because |l' - l| ≤1.

So the integral is non-zero for specific m' and m.

But wait, the integral of Y_{2,m1}^* Y_{1,m} is zero unless m1 = m + s, where s is the m of the dipole operator? Or wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m + m_dipole, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m.

Because when you multiply Y_{1,m} by Y_{0,0} (which is 1), the product's angular part is Y_{1,m}, and when you take the integral with Y_{2, m1}^*, the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m.

Wait, but Y_{2,m1} and Y_{1,m} are orthogonal unless m1 = m. Because the integral of Y_{l1,m1}^* Y_{l2,m2} is zero unless l1 = l2 and m1 = m2.

Wait, no, that's only when l1 = l2 and m1 = m2. But if l1 ≠ l2, which is our case (2 and 1), maybe the integral can be non-zero in other ways.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the selection rules for the transition. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps for the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so l=0. The dipole operator has l=1, so the final state must have l=1.

But in terms of m, the transition can change m by 0, ±1.

So the dipole operator component Y_{1, m} can cause a change in m of m. So when you have initial m=0, the final m is 0 + m, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each component of the dipole operator (i.e., each m in -1, 0, +1), you can have a transition to m1 = m.

But the matrix element's magnitude depends on the overlap between Y_{2,m1} and Y_{1, m}.

Wait, perhaps the only non-zero matrix elements are when m1 = m. Because when you have the initial state Y_{0,0}, which is 1, and the dipole operator is Y_{1,m}, the product is Y_{1,m}. Then the final state Y_{2,m1} must have a component along Y_{1,m}.

Wait, but Y_{2,m1} and Y_{1,m} are orthogonal unless m1 = m. Because when you multiply Y_{1,m} and Y_{0,0}, you get Y_{1,m}, and then you integrate that with Y_{2,m1}^*, which is zero unless m1 = m, because spherical harmonics of different m are orthogonal.

Wait, but that can't be right, because Y_{2,m1} can have components from Y_{1,m} through addition. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when m1 = m. Because the product of Y_{2,m1}^* and Y_{1,m} will only have a non-zero integral when m1 = m.

Wait, but that would mean that the only allowed m1 in the first transition are m1 = -1, 0, +1, but the matrix elements are non-zero only when m1 = m, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. So all three transitions are allowed, but their probabilities vary.

But then, when we have the first transition, say to m1=0, then in the second transition, we can go to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but what's the second transition's matrix element?

The second transition is from |2,1, m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the dipole operator has components Y_{1, m}, so the change in m is m.

Thus, for the second transition, the initial state has m=m1, and the dipole operator's m can be -1, 0, +1. So the final m is m1 + m.

But the final state has m=0, so 0 = m1 + m_dipole. So m_dipole = -m1.

Which must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for the second transition:

If m1=0 → m_dipole must be 0.

If m1=1 → m_dipole must be -1.

If m1=-1 → m_dipole must be +1.

But what are the selection rules for this? Are all these allowed?

Yes, because m_dipole can be -1, 0, +1.

But again, the matrix elements may vary. So the transition probabilities depend on the product of the first and second matrix elements squared.

But the question is about the overall probability, so perhaps the paths with m1=0 are more probable.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and D have m1=0 in the first transition. Options B and C have m1=+1 and -1, respectively.

Wait, the options are:

A) 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0; probability 1/3.

B) →2,1,1 →1,0,0; 1/4.

C) →2,1,-1 →1,0,0; 1/4.

D) →2,1,0 →1,0,0; 2/3.

So the question is, which of these is the correct path(s) and what's the probability.

Wait, but the problem says the transition is via two dipole transitions, and asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability.

So each option gives a route and a probability.

So which option correctly describes the possible paths and the probability.

I think that the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

Wait, but the problem says 'the transition route', implying a single path, but the options include different possible paths. So perhaps the question is about the possible route and the probability of that particular route.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one possible path, but the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the probability is 1/3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the hydrogen atom, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=1, l=0 can occur via two-step transitions. The intermediate state must have l=1, so n can be 2 or 4? But since 4 is higher than 3, that's less likely. So probably the intermediate state is n=2, l=1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1>, |2,1, 0>, |2,1, +1>.

Each of these can then transition to |1,0,0>, but the matrix elements vary.

The probability of each path is the product of the probabilities of each transition.

But how to compute that.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible m's in the first transition. Since there are three possible m1's ( -1, 0, +1), each with an equal chance? No, that's not necessarily the case, because the matrix elements may not be the same for each.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions with m1=0 have a higher probability because the matrix element is larger.

Wait, I remember that when you have a dipole transition, the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for m=0 are larger, perhaps.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m=0 would be sqrt( (1)(2) )/( sqrt( (2)(3)) )) )? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the coefficients for m=0 are larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element for m1=0 is larger, so the transition to m1=0 is more probable.

Similarly, in the second transition, the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> would have a non-zero matrix element.

Wait, but perhaps the overall probability for the |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> transition is higher than the others.

So maybe the path through m1=0 is more probable. So if the first transition goes to m1=0, the probability is higher.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is 1/3 because there are three possible ways (m1= -1,0,+1), each contributing equally. But the options don't show this except for option A, which has 1/3, but only for the path through m1=0.

Wait, no. If all three paths are possible, but each has a certain probability, then the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

But the question's options give specific paths and their probabilities, so perhaps each option is suggesting a particular path and the probability of that path.

So which of these options is correct.

Looking back, I think that the correct path for the two-step transition is either via |2,1,0> or via |2,1, ±1>.

Wait, I've read that the dipole transition from |n, l, m> to |n', l±1, m'> is allowed only when certain conditions are met, and the matrix elements are non-zero only for specific m' and m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> can only go to |2,1,0>, because m1=0 is the only allowed value. But why?

Wait, another approach: what is the parity of the state? The hydrogen atom states have parity (-1)^l. So |3,0,0> has parity +1, |2,1, m> has parity (-1)^1 = -1, and |1,0,0> has parity +1.

In a dipole transition, the parity changes because the dipole operator has parity -1. So each dipole transition flips the parity.

So the first transition from |3,0,0> (parity +1) would go to a state with parity -1 (like |2,1,m>), then the second transition would take it back to parity +1 (like |1,0,0>).

So the parity considerations are satisfied.

But that doesn't directly help with the m values.

Wait, perhaps the selection rule for m is that it can change by 0, ±1, but in the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1>, m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

But perhaps the transition to m1=0 is more probable because of symmetry.

Alternatively, considering that the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the transition may favor m1=0 because the dipole operator's m=0 component (which is proportional to the z-component) would have a higher overlap.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each would contribute to transitions with m1 = +1, 0, -1.

But perhaps the m=0 component (z) has a higher probability because it's aligned along the quantization axis, and the initial state is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for all three m1, leading to each having a 1/3 chance.

But that would make the overall probability for a particular path (like m1=0) 1/3, but the question is about two transitions, each with their own probabilities.

Wait, the probability of a two-step transition is the product of the probabilities of each step.

So the overall probability for each path would be (probability of first step) * (probability of second step).

Assuming that each first step (m1) has the same probability, but perhaps the second steps (from m1 to 0) have different probabilities.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe the first transition has probabilities that sum to 1, and each step's probability is a fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed transition is via m1=0, making the probability 1.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, which suggests that there are three possible paths, each contributing equally.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible answers.

Options A and D involve the intermediate state |2,1,0>, while B and C have |2,1,1> and |2,1,-1> respectively.

If the correct route goes through m1=0, then options A or D are possible.

The probabilities given are 1/3, 1/4, 1/4, and 2/3.

Wait, another angle: The transition from n=3 to n=1 would involve two steps: 3→2 and 2→1.

The number of possible ways for each step.

The first step (3→2) can have m1 = -1, 0, +1.

Each of these has a certain probability, say p(-1), p(0), p(+1). The sum of these is 1.

The second step (from each m1 to 0) would have certain probabilities, say q(m1), which is the probability of transitioning from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

The overall probability for each path is p(m1) * q(m1).

But without knowing the exact values of p and q, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1> has certain probabilities based on the matrix element's square.

The matrix element M is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨2, m1 | 1, m | 3,0⟩.

Wait, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this is zero unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has l=1, m components of -1,0,+1.

The first transition's matrix element is proportional to ⟨2, m1 | 1, m |3,0⟩.

But the state |3,0,0> can be expressed in terms of the product of |2, m1> and |1, m>, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is zero unless m1 = 0, making the only possible path through m1=0.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator has m components, so the first transition can only have m1=0.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the dipole operator has all three m components.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about specific selection rules for the dipole transition.

The standard selection rules are:

Δl = ±1,

Δm = 0, ±1,

and no restriction on Δn except it has to be possible.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, in addition to the dipole selection rules, the transition must be allowed by the electric dipole selection rules, which require that the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator is non-zero.

So perhaps for the first transition, the dipole operator's components are such that only certain m1 are allowed.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator is proportional to r, which in spherical coordinates is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0}.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The position vector r in spherical coordinates has components that can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics.

Wait, the dipole moment operator is given by μ = e r, where r is the position vector. In spherical coordinates, r can be expressed using the spherical harmonics Y_{1,m}, but I think the z-component is proportional to Y_{1,0}, and the x and y components are proportional to Y_{1, ±1}.

So the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, and Y_{1,-1}.

So when the dipole operator acts on |3,0,0>, it can cause transitions to states with l=1, and m1 = 0 + m, where m is -1, 0, +1.

So the possible m1 are -1, 0, +1.

But wait, let's think about the matrix element for each m1.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m1| r |3,0,0⟩.

Since r is proportional to Y_{1,0} (for the z-component) plus other terms, but perhaps the dominant term is Y_{1,0}.

Wait, no, the position vector r has Cartesian components:

x = r sinθ cosφ,

y = r sinθ e^{iφ},

z = r cosθ.

But these can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics:

x = sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}^*,

y = (i/ sqrt(4π/3)) (Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,-1}^*),

z = sqrt(4π) Y_{1,0}.

So the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, ±1} and Y_{1,0}.

So when the dipole operator acts on |3,0,0>, the transition is to |2,1, m1>, where m1 is determined by the component of the dipole operator.

So for the z-component (Y_{1,0}), m1 = 0 + 0 = 0.

For the x-component (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}^*), integrating with Y_{3,0,0} would give m1 = 1 and m1 = -1.

Similarly, the y-component would contribute to m1 = +1 and m1 = -1.

Wait, but the matrix elements for the x and y components might cancel out due to symmetry.

Because the state |3,0,0> is symmetric under rotations, so the transition via x or y components may not contribute because the integrals are zero.

Wait, when you integrate Y_{1,1} Y_{3,0,0} Y_{2, m1}^*, the integral is non-zero only if m1 = 1.

But wait, the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), so the integral ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1,1} Y_{3,0,0} dΩ would be zero unless m1 =1.

Similarly for Y_{1,-1}, the integral would be zero unless m1 = -1.

Wait, but perhaps the integral is zero unless m1=0.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the parity of the wavefunctions.

The initial state is |3,0,0> (even parity, since (-1)^l = +1), the dipole operator has odd parity (since it's proportional to r, which has parity -1), and the intermediate state |2,1, m1> has parity (-1)^1 = -1.

So the product of the parity of the initial state and the dipole operator is (+1)(-1) = -1, which matches the parity of the intermediate state (-1).

Similarly, in the second transition, the intermediate state has parity (-1), and the dipole operator again has parity (-1), so the final state has parity (+1), which matches |1,0,0>.

So parity is conserved correctly.

But back to the matrix elements.

The integral for the transition via the z-component (Y_{1,0}) would be ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{3,0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{3,0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so it's a constant. So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{l, m} dΩ is zero unless l' = l and m' = m.

In our case, l' =2, l=1. So the integral is zero because 2≠1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the initial state is |3,0,0>, which has l=0, and the dipole operator has l=1. So the product of the dipole operator and the initial state would have l=1.

Thus, the final state must have l=1, which is the case. So the integral can be non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of selection rules.

The dipole operator has l=1, so the initial l=0 can transition to l=1.

The integral involves Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, Y_{0,0} is 1, so the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} dΩ.

The product Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} can have angular momentum components from 1 to 2 (since 2-1=1 ≤ l ≤ 2+1=3).

So for the integral to be non-zero, the product must have a component with l=1, because the initial dipole operator has l=1.

Wait, perhaps using the properties of spherical harmonics:

The integral ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{1, m'} dΩ is non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are met.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the standard selection rules for dipole transitions in hydrogen.

From what I remember, the allowed transitions are those where the dipole matrix element is non-zero. For hydrogen, transitions are allowed when l changes by ±1, and m changes by 0, ±1.

But when the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the dipole operator can induce transitions only to states with l=1 and m=0, because the dipole operator's m=0 component (z) is the only one that has a non-zero integral with the spherically symmetric state.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the initial state is spherically symmetric, so any angular dependence must come from the dipole operator.

The z-component of the dipole operator (Y_{1,0}) would have a non-zero integral with the initial state because Y_{0,0} is isotropic, and Y_{1,0} has a z dependence.

But Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} have dependencies that vary with angle, so their integrals with Y_{0,0} would be zero.

So, in the first transition, the only allowed m1 is 0.

Because the integral of Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{0,0} is non-zero only when m=0, leading to m1=0.

So the first transition can only go to m1=0. Therefore, the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>.

Then, the second transition |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.

So the route is 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Which matches options A and D.

Now, the probability. So since the first transition can only go to m1=0, the second transition's probability is the only one to consider.

But what's the probability for each step.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the two-step transition is the product of the two matrix elements' squares.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probabilities are normalized in a certain way.

Looking at the options, option A has a probability of 1/3, D has 2/3.

Wait, but in reality, the transition from n=3 to n=1 via two steps would have a certain probability, but the options are giving specific fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the sum of the squares of the possible paths. But in this case, since only one path is possible (m1=0), the probability is just the product of the two steps' probabilities.

But I'm not sure about the exact probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible m changes. Since the first transition can only go to m1=0, the probability for that step is 1, and the second step has a probability that depends on the available m transitions.

In the second step, from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>, the dipole operator can cause m changes of 0, ±1.

But the final m is 0. So the dipole operator must provide a delta m of -0 = 0, which is allowed.

So the matrix element is non-zero, and the transition is allowed.

But the exact probability depends on the square of the matrix element. If the dipole operator for the second step has a non-zero matrix element, then the transition is allowed.

But again, without exact calculations, it's hard to say the exact probability.

The options give probabilities of 1/3, 1/4, 1/4, and 2/3.

Wait, perhaps the probability is 1/3 because there are three possible first transitions, but in reality, only one is allowed, so the probability is 1 for the first step, and then the second step's probability would determine the overall.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of the two-step transition is 1/3 because there are three possible paths, but only one is allowed, making the probability 1, but that's not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible options.

Options A and D have the same transition path, but different probabilities.

Option A says the probability is 1/3.

Option D says the probability is 2/3.

Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Assuming that each step has a certain branching probability.

The first transition from 3→2 is to l=1, n=2. The probability for that is a certain value.

The second transition from 2→1 is another certain value.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps it's better to think about the possible number of states.

Wait, another approach: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> are to any state with l=1, so |2,1, m>, with m=-1, 0, +1.

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, only the m=0 component of the dipole operator contributes, making the first transition only to |2,1,0>.

Thus, the first transition's probability is 1, and the second transition's probability is 1 (if it's allowed).

But that can't be the case because the options don't have 1 as an option. So perhaps the second transition has a probability of 1/3 or another fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of the two-step transition is 1/3 because there are three possible two-step paths, each contributing 1/3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible transitions from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>.

The selection rules allow m to change by 0, ±1. So from m=0, the delta m can be 0, -1, +1.

So the dipole operator can cause transitions to m=0, -1, +1. But the final state has m=0, so only the delta m=0 transition is allowed.

Wait, no. Wait, the dipole operator has m components of -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |2,1,0> can go to |1,0,0> only if the dipole operator's m is 0, because 0 (initial m) + m_dipole = final m=0 → m_dipole=0.

So the only component of the dipole operator that allows this transition is the m=0 component.

Thus, the probability of this second transition is the square of the matrix element for m_dipole=0.

Which would be a certain fraction.

If each dipole component has equal probability, the probability would be 1/3.

So the overall probability for the two-step transition is 1 (first step) * 1/3 (second step) = 1/3.

Which would match option A's probability of 1/3.

But wait, earlier I thought that the first transition could only go to m1=0, making the first step probability 1. Then the second transition's probability is 1/3, so the total is 1/3.

That would make option A correct.

But looking at the options, option A's route is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

So the answer would be option A.

The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis is based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require:

1. **Selection Rules**:  
   - Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum).  
   - Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number).  
   - Δn can be any integer, but transitions between adjacent principal quantum numbers (e.g., n=3 to n=2, and n=2 to n=1) are most probable.  

2. **Initial and Final States**:  
   - Initial state: |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).  
   - Final state: |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).  

3. **Intermediate State**:  
   - The intermediate state must have l=1 (since Δl = ±1).  
   - Possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩, where m = -1, 0, +1.  

4. **First Transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m₁)**:  
   - The dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, and Y_{1,-1}.  
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0), so the transition is allowed only if the dipole operator's m component matches the final state's m.  
   - The transition to m₁ = -1 or m₁ = +1 is forbidden because the integrals involving Y_{1,1} or Y_{1,-1} with the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state vanish.  
   - Only the m₁ = 0 transition is allowed, as it involves the m=0 component of the dipole operator (proportional to Y_{1,0}).  

5. **Second Transition (2,1,0 → 1,0,0)**:  
   - The intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ has m=0.  
   - The dipole operator can cause a Δm = 0 transition, allowing the final state |1,0,0⟩ (m=0).  
   - The transition is allowed, and the probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole operator's m=0 component.  

6. **Overall Probability**:  
   - Since the first transition can only occur to m₁ = 0, the probability of the first step is effectively 1.  
   - The second transition has a probability proportional to the square of the matrix element for the dipole operator's m=0 component.  
   - Assuming equal probabilities for the dipole operator's m components, the second transition has a probability of 1/3.  
   - The total probability for the two-step transition is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: 1 × 1/3 = 1/3.  

7. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.  
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the first transition to m₁ = +1 is forbidden.  
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the first transition to m₁ = -1 is forbidden.  
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 2/3.  

**Conclusion**: The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.  

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by selection rules, especially for dipole transitions.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are: delta l (the change in angular momentum) can be ±1, and delta m (the change in magnetic quantum number) can be 0, ±1. Also, the n (principal quantum number) can change by any integer, but in practice, it's usually adjacent levels since higher jumps are less probable, but the question says two dipole transitions so it's definitely two steps.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It needs to decay to n=1, l=0, m=0, but via two transitions. So each step must follow the selection rules.

Let me think about the possible intermediate states. From (3,0,0), the first transition can go to some (n', l', m'). Since l=0, the next l' must be l±1, so l' can be 1. So the first step must go to l=1.

What about the possible m values? Starting from m=0, the next m can be -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could have m=0, ±1. And the principal quantum number n can change by ±1 in each step. So from n=3, first transition could go to n=2 or n=4. But since we're going to n=1 in two steps, probably the first transition is from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1.

Wait, but wait, if the first transition is 3→2, that's a change in n by -1. Then the second can be 2→1, which is another -1 change. So two transitions each with n decreasing by 1.

So the intermediate state has n=2, l=1. So possible m values are -1, 0, +1. But the initial state has m=0, so in the first transition, m can go to m=0±1 or stay the same. So possible m' for the first step are -1, 0, +1. But the initial state is |3,0,0>, so m starts at 0. So first transition to |2,1, m> where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but for the first transition, the selection rule allows m to change by 0 or ±1. So the first state could be |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1, +1>.

Then the second transition must take this to |1,0,0>. So from |2,1, m>, what can happen?

Again, applying selection rules. For the second transition, from n=2 to n=1 (delta n = -1), l=1 to l=0 (delta l = -1), which is allowed because l changes by ±1. And m must change by 0 or ±1. So let's see each possibility.

If the intermediate state is |2,1, m>, what m can it have to allow transition to |1,0,0>.

From |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>, so delta m must be 0 - m. So delta m = -m. But delta m must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for the second transition:

m must change by exactly -m, but that delta m must be one of -1, 0, +1.

Wait, no. The delta m for the second transition is (m_final - m_initial). Wait, no, the delta m is what the transition can change. So m_final = m_initial + delta m. So in the second transition, m_final is 0. So from the intermediate state, which is |2,1, m>, the transition must have delta m = (0 - m). So delta m must be such that m + delta m = 0. So delta m = -m.

But delta m can only be 0, ±1. So possible only if -m is in {0, ±1}. So m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, let me think again. The second transition is from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>. So delta l is -1 (allowed), delta n is -1 (allowed). The delta m must be 0 - m, which must be either -1, 0, or +1.

So 0 - m = delta m ∈ {-1, 0, +1}. So 0 - m = either -1, 0, or +1. Therefore, m can be 1, 0, or -1.

Wait, let me correct that. The delta m is (m_final - m_initial). So m_final is 0. So delta m = 0 - m. So delta m can be -m, and it must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for delta m to be in those values, m can be 0, ±1.

Because:

If m = 0: delta m = 0. Which is allowed.

If m = 1: delta m = -1. Which is allowed.

If m = -1: delta m = +1. Also allowed.

So any intermediate state with m = 0, 1, or -1 can transition to m=0. So all three possibilities for the first transition's m are acceptable.

But wait, considering the first transition from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m= m1.

So the possible m1 values are -1, 0, +1.

So for each of these, the second transition can proceed to m=0.

So the possible transition paths are:

(3,0,0) → (2,1, m1), then (2,1, m1) → (1,0,0), for m1 = -1, 0, +1.

So for each possible m1, the path is allowed.

But the question is about the probability. The options have different probability fractions, so we need to compute which path is more probable.

Wait, but why would the probabilities differ? Maybe because the transition dipole moment depends on the matrix elements, which may be zero or non-zero.

Oh right, the transition dipole moment determines the probability. If the matrix element is zero, the transition doesn't occur. So not all m1 are allowed in the first step, or in the second.

Wait, but no, because I thought the selection rules allow for m changes of 0, ±1. So the selection rules are satisfied for all three m1 values. But perhaps the matrix elements are non-zero only for some.

Wait, so the dipole transition matrix element is given by:

⟨f| r |i⟩, where f is the final state.

In spherical coordinates, r can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. The matrix element involves integrals of Y_{l', m'}* Y_{1, q} Y_{l, m}. So the integral is zero unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, the dipole operator has angular momentum components proportional to Y_{1, m} with m = -1, 0, +1. So the selection rule for m is delta m = 0, ±1, but the actual integrals may vanish for some cases.

Wait, more accurately, the matrix element is non-zero only if the product of the spherical harmonics allows for the integral to be non-zero. The integral ∫ Y_{l', m'}* Y_{1, m} Y_{l, m} dΩ is zero unless certain conditions are met.

The selection rules are that for the dipole transition, the change in m can be 0, ±1. But when you have l and l' such that |l - l'| ≤ 1 ≤ l + l', which is already satisfied here because from l=0 to l=1.

Wait, maybe the key is that when going from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m1>, the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for specific m1.

Similarly, when going from |2,1, m1> to |1,0,0>, the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for specific m1.

So for the first transition, |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>, the matrix element will be non-zero only when m1 = 0 ±1, which are -1, 0, +1, which is all possible. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, the initial state has m=0, and the dipole operator has m components of -1, 0, +1. So the dipole operator can cause a change in m of -1, 0, +1. So the possible m1's are 0-1, 0, 0+1 → -1, 0, +1.

So all three m1 are possible in the first transition. But their matrix elements vary.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to rY_{1,m}, so the matrix element ⟨2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only when m1 = m (since the initial m is 0) plus the m from Y_{1,m}. So m1 = 0 + m, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but in the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0> with m=0. So the dipole operator's m component determines the change in m. So for the first transition, the possible m1's are 0 + (-1)= -1, 0 + 0=0, and 0 +1= +1. So all three are allowed.

So the first transition can go to |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1, +1>.

But then, in the second transition, from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the dipole operator can cause a change in m of -1, 0, +1. So for each m1, what's the possible delta m.

Wait, the second transition must have m change from m1 to 0. So delta m = 0 - m1. So for the second transition, delta m must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for each m1:

If m1 = 0: delta m = 0 → allowed.

If m1 = +1: delta m = -1 → allowed.

If m1 = -1: delta m = +1 → allowed.

So all three possibilities are allowed.

But wait, the matrix elements for these transitions may not all be the same. So the probability depends on the square of the matrix elements. So perhaps some transitions are more probable than others.

So let's think about the first transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>.

The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or something similar.

Alternatively, for the dipole transition, the probability can be found using the Wigner-Eckart theorem.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m1| r |3,0,0⟩.

But r is proportional to Y_{1,0} (I think, because the dipole operator has components along Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1, +1} corresponding to the x, y, z components). Wait, no, the dipole operator is given in terms of Cartesian components. For example, the electric dipole moment has components like e x Y_{1,1} + e y Y_{1,-1} + e z Y_{1,0} (or something like that). So each component of the dipole operator can cause a change in m by 1, 0, or -1, respectively.

But perhaps for our purposes, the key is that the matrix element ⟨2,1, m1| r |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero, and the transition is allowed for m1 = -1, 0, +1.

But the question is about the probabilities, so which of these m1 is more probable.

Wait, perhaps the selection rule for the transition is that the matrix element is non-zero when certain conditions are met beyond just delta m.

Wait, the Wigner-Eckart theorem says that the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is zero unless specific angular momentum conditions are met.

In the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has angular momentum 1 (since it's an electric dipole). So the product of the dipole operator (l=1) and initial state (l=0) must combine to the final state (l=1). So the coupling happens as 0 (initial l) +1 (dipole) → 1 (final l).

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is non-zero only when m_final = m_initial + m_dipole.

In our case, initial m is 0, dipole m can be -1, 0, +1. So the final m can be -1, 0, +1.

So all three are allowed.

But the matrix element's magnitude may differ. So perhaps the transition to m1=0 has a higher probability than others.

Wait, how does the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient affect the magnitude?

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (s state) with l=1 (p state) to get l=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are:

⟨ l', m' | l, m; 1, m_dipole ⟩.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the general expression for the matrix element. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the same for each of the m1 = -1, 0, +1 in the first transition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the matrix element for the dipole transition would involve the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{l', m'} Y_{l, m_initial}^*. For l=0, Y_0^0 is a constant, so the integral reduces to Y_{1,m} Y_{l', m'}, integrated over all angles. So the integral is non-zero only if m' = m + m_initial. Since initial m is 0, m' is just m.

Thus, the matrix element is non-zero only for m' = m, where m is -1, 0, +1. So the first transition can go to m1= -1, 0, +1.

But the magnitude may differ, so perhaps the transition probabilities are different.

Wait, for the dipole operator, the components are proportional to Y_{1, m}, m = -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{2,1, m1}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{3,0, 0}.

Since Y_{3,0,0} is a constant, the integral becomes Y_{2,1, m1}^* Y_{1,m}.

The integral of Y_{l=2,m1}^* Y_{l=1,m} is zero unless m1 = m ± something? Or perhaps it's non-zero only when certain conditions hold.

Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫ Y_{2,m1}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{1, m'} dΩ is non-zero if m1 = m + m', and if |2-1| ≤ 1 ≤ 2+1, which is 1 ≤1 ≤3. So l=1 is allowed. So the integral is non-zero for m1 = m + m'.

Wait, but in our case, the integral is Y_{2,m1}^* Y_{1,m} (since Y_0^0 is 1, so it doesn't affect the product). So the integral is non-zero only if m1 = m (since Y_{1, m} is being multiplied by Y_{2,m1}^* and 1). So the integral is zero unless m1 = m.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>, so its Y is Y_{0,0}.

The matrix element is ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* (Y_{1, m}) Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so it's a constant.

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{l',m'}^* Y_{l,m} dΩ is zero unless l' = l ±1, which isn't the case here since 2 and 1 is a difference of 1, which is allowed. Wait, 2-1=1, which is allowed because |l' - l| ≤1.

So the integral is non-zero for specific m' and m.

But wait, the integral of Y_{2,m1}^* Y_{1,m} is zero unless m1 = m + s, where s is the m of the dipole operator? Or wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m + m_dipole, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m.

Because when you multiply Y_{1,m} by Y_{0,0} (which is 1), the product's angular part is Y_{1,m}, and when you take the integral with Y_{2, m1}^*, the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m.

Wait, but Y_{2,m1} and Y_{1,m} are orthogonal unless m1 = m. Because the integral of Y_{l1,m1}^* Y_{l2,m2} is zero unless l1 = l2 and m1 = m2.

Wait, no, that's only when l1 = l2 and m1 = m2. But if l1 ≠ l2, which is our case (2 and 1), maybe the integral can be non-zero in other ways.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the selection rules for the transition. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps for the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so l=0. The dipole operator has l=1, so the final state must have l=1.

But in terms of m, the transition can change m by 0, ±1.

So the dipole operator component Y_{1, m} can cause a change in m of m. So when you have initial m=0, the final m is 0 + m, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each component of the dipole operator (i.e., each m in -1, 0, +1), you can have a transition to m1 = m.

But the matrix element's magnitude depends on the overlap between Y_{2,m1} and Y_{1, m}.

Wait, perhaps the only non-zero matrix elements are when m1 = m. Because when you have the initial state Y_{0,0}, which is 1, and the dipole operator is Y_{1,m}, the product is Y_{1,m}. Then the final state Y_{2,m1} must have a component along Y_{1,m}.

Wait, but Y_{2,m1} and Y_{1,m} are orthogonal unless m1 = m. Because when you multiply Y_{1,m} and Y_{0,0}, you get Y_{1,m}, and then you integrate that with Y_{2,m1}^*, which is zero unless m1 = m, because spherical harmonics of different m are orthogonal.

Wait, but that can't be right, because Y_{2,m1} can have components from Y_{1,m} through addition. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when m1 = m. Because the product of Y_{2,m1}^* and Y_{1,m} will only have a non-zero integral when m1 = m.

Wait, but that would mean that the only allowed m1 in the first transition are m1 = -1, 0, +1, but the matrix elements are non-zero only when m1 = m, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. So all three transitions are allowed, but their probabilities vary.

But then, when we have the first transition, say to m1=0, then in the second transition, we can go to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but what's the second transition's matrix element?

The second transition is from |2,1, m1> to |1,0,0>.

Again, the dipole operator has components Y_{1, m}, so the change in m is m.

Thus, for the second transition, the initial state has m=m1, and the dipole operator's m can be -1, 0, +1. So the final m is m1 + m.

But the final state has m=0, so 0 = m1 + m_dipole. So m_dipole = -m1.

Which must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

So for the second transition:

If m1=0 → m_dipole must be 0.

If m1=1 → m_dipole must be -1.

If m1=-1 → m_dipole must be +1.

But what are the selection rules for this? Are all these allowed?

Yes, because m_dipole can be -1, 0, +1.

But again, the matrix elements may vary. So the transition probabilities depend on the product of the first and second matrix elements squared.

But the question is about the overall probability, so perhaps the paths with m1=0 are more probable.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and D have m1=0 in the first transition. Options B and C have m1=+1 and -1, respectively.

Wait, the options are:

A) 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0; probability 1/3.

B) →2,1,1 →1,0,0; 1/4.

C) →2,1,-1 →1,0,0; 1/4.

D) →2,1,0 →1,0,0; 2/3.

So the question is, which of these is the correct path(s) and what's the probability.

Wait, but the problem says the transition is via two dipole transitions, and asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability.

So each option gives a route and a probability.

So which option correctly describes the possible paths and the probability.

I think that the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

Wait, but the problem says 'the transition route', implying a single path, but the options include different possible paths. So perhaps the question is about the possible route and the probability of that particular route.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one possible path, but the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the probability is 1/3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the hydrogen atom, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=1, l=0 can occur via two-step transitions. The intermediate state must have l=1, so n can be 2 or 4? But since 4 is higher than 3, that's less likely. So probably the intermediate state is n=2, l=1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1>, |2,1, 0>, |2,1, +1>.

Each of these can then transition to |1,0,0>, but the matrix elements vary.

The probability of each path is the product of the probabilities of each transition.

But how to compute that.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible m's in the first transition. Since there are three possible m1's ( -1, 0, +1), each with an equal chance? No, that's not necessarily the case, because the matrix elements may not be the same for each.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions with m1=0 have a higher probability because the matrix element is larger.

Wait, I remember that when you have a dipole transition, the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for m=0 are larger, perhaps.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m=0 would be sqrt( (1)(2) )/( sqrt( (2)(3)) )) )? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the coefficients for m=0 are larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element for m1=0 is larger, so the transition to m1=0 is more probable.

Similarly, in the second transition, the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> would have a non-zero matrix element.

Wait, but perhaps the overall probability for the |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> transition is higher than the others.

So maybe the path through m1=0 is more probable. So if the first transition goes to m1=0, the probability is higher.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is 1/3 because there are three possible ways (m1= -1,0,+1), each contributing equally. But the options don't show this except for option A, which has 1/3, but only for the path through m1=0.

Wait, no. If all three paths are possible, but each has a certain probability, then the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

But the question's options give specific paths and their probabilities, so perhaps each option is suggesting a particular path and the probability of that path.

So which of these options is correct.

Looking back, I think that the correct path for the two-step transition is either via |2,1,0> or via |2,1, ±1>.

Wait, I've read that the dipole transition from |n, l, m> to |n', l±1, m'> is allowed only when certain conditions are met, and the matrix elements are non-zero only for specific m' and m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> can only go to |2,1,0>, because m1=0 is the only allowed value. But why?

Wait, another approach: what is the parity of the state? The hydrogen atom states have parity (-1)^l. So |3,0,0> has parity +1, |2,1, m> has parity (-1)^1 = -1, and |1,0,0> has parity +1.

In a dipole transition, the parity changes because the dipole operator has parity -1. So each dipole transition flips the parity.

So the first transition from |3,0,0> (parity +1) would go to a state with parity -1 (like |2,1,m>), then the second transition would take it back to parity +1 (like |1,0,0>).

So the parity considerations are satisfied.

But that doesn't directly help with the m values.

Wait, perhaps the selection rule for m is that it can change by 0, ±1, but in the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1>, m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

But perhaps the transition to m1=0 is more probable because of symmetry.

Alternatively, considering that the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the transition may favor m1=0 because the dipole operator's m=0 component (which is proportional to the z-component) would have a higher overlap.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each would contribute to transitions with m1 = +1, 0, -1.

But perhaps the m=0 component (z) has a higher probability because it's aligned along the quantization axis, and the initial state is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for all three m1, leading to each having a 1/3 chance.

But that would make the overall probability for a particular path (like m1=0) 1/3, but the question is about two transitions, each with their own probabilities.

Wait, the probability of a two-step transition is the product of the probabilities of each step.

So the overall probability for each path would be (probability of first step) * (probability of second step).

Assuming that each first step (m1) has the same probability, but perhaps the second steps (from m1 to 0) have different probabilities.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe the first transition has probabilities that sum to 1, and each step's probability is a fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed transition is via m1=0, making the probability 1.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, which suggests that there are three possible paths, each contributing equally.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible answers.

Options A and D involve the intermediate state |2,1,0>, while B and C have |2,1,1> and |2,1,-1> respectively.

If the correct route goes through m1=0, then options A or D are possible.

The probabilities given are 1/3, 1/4, 1/4, and 2/3.

Wait, another angle: The transition from n=3 to n=1 would involve two steps: 3→2 and 2→1.

The number of possible ways for each step.

The first step (3→2) can have m1 = -1, 0, +1.

Each of these has a certain probability, say p(-1), p(0), p(+1). The sum of these is 1.

The second step (from each m1 to 0) would have certain probabilities, say q(m1), which is the probability of transitioning from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>.

The overall probability for each path is p(m1) * q(m1).

But without knowing the exact values of p and q, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1> has certain probabilities based on the matrix element's square.

The matrix element M is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨2, m1 | 1, m | 3,0⟩.

Wait, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this is zero unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has l=1, m components of -1,0,+1.

The first transition's matrix element is proportional to ⟨2, m1 | 1, m |3,0⟩.

But the state |3,0,0> can be expressed in terms of the product of |2, m1> and |1, m>, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element is zero unless m1 = 0, making the only possible path through m1=0.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator has m components, so the first transition can only have m1=0.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the dipole operator has all three m components.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about specific selection rules for the dipole transition.

The standard selection rules are:

Δl = ±1,

Δm = 0, ±1,

and no restriction on Δn except it has to be possible.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, in addition to the dipole selection rules, the transition must be allowed by the electric dipole selection rules, which require that the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator is non-zero.

So perhaps for the first transition, the dipole operator's components are such that only certain m1 are allowed.

Wait, perhaps the dipole operator is proportional to r, which in spherical coordinates is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0}.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The position vector r in spherical coordinates has components that can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics.

Wait, the dipole moment operator is given by μ = e r, where r is the position vector. In spherical coordinates, r can be expressed using the spherical harmonics Y_{1,m}, but I think the z-component is proportional to Y_{1,0}, and the x and y components are proportional to Y_{1, ±1}.

So the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, and Y_{1,-1}.

So when the dipole operator acts on |3,0,0>, it can cause transitions to states with l=1, and m1 = 0 + m, where m is -1, 0, +1.

So the possible m1 are -1, 0, +1.

But wait, let's think about the matrix element for each m1.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m1| r |3,0,0⟩.

Since r is proportional to Y_{1,0} (for the z-component) plus other terms, but perhaps the dominant term is Y_{1,0}.

Wait, no, the position vector r has Cartesian components:

x = r sinθ cosφ,

y = r sinθ e^{iφ},

z = r cosθ.

But these can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics:

x = sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}^*,

y = (i/ sqrt(4π/3)) (Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,-1}^*),

z = sqrt(4π) Y_{1,0}.

So the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, ±1} and Y_{1,0}.

So when the dipole operator acts on |3,0,0>, the transition is to |2,1, m1>, where m1 is determined by the component of the dipole operator.

So for the z-component (Y_{1,0}), m1 = 0 + 0 = 0.

For the x-component (Y_{1,1} + Y_{1,-1}^*), integrating with Y_{3,0,0} would give m1 = 1 and m1 = -1.

Similarly, the y-component would contribute to m1 = +1 and m1 = -1.

Wait, but the matrix elements for the x and y components might cancel out due to symmetry.

Because the state |3,0,0> is symmetric under rotations, so the transition via x or y components may not contribute because the integrals are zero.

Wait, when you integrate Y_{1,1} Y_{3,0,0} Y_{2, m1}^*, the integral is non-zero only if m1 = 1.

But wait, the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), so the integral ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1,1} Y_{3,0,0} dΩ would be zero unless m1 =1.

Similarly for Y_{1,-1}, the integral would be zero unless m1 = -1.

Wait, but perhaps the integral is zero unless m1=0.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the parity of the wavefunctions.

The initial state is |3,0,0> (even parity, since (-1)^l = +1), the dipole operator has odd parity (since it's proportional to r, which has parity -1), and the intermediate state |2,1, m1> has parity (-1)^1 = -1.

So the product of the parity of the initial state and the dipole operator is (+1)(-1) = -1, which matches the parity of the intermediate state (-1).

Similarly, in the second transition, the intermediate state has parity (-1), and the dipole operator again has parity (-1), so the final state has parity (+1), which matches |1,0,0>.

So parity is conserved correctly.

But back to the matrix elements.

The integral for the transition via the z-component (Y_{1,0}) would be ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{3,0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{3,0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so it's a constant. So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{l, m} dΩ is zero unless l' = l and m' = m.

In our case, l' =2, l=1. So the integral is zero because 2≠1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the initial state is |3,0,0>, which has l=0, and the dipole operator has l=1. So the product of the dipole operator and the initial state would have l=1.

Thus, the final state must have l=1, which is the case. So the integral can be non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think in terms of selection rules.

The dipole operator has l=1, so the initial l=0 can transition to l=1.

The integral involves Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, Y_{0,0} is 1, so the integral becomes ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} dΩ.

The product Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} can have angular momentum components from 1 to 2 (since 2-1=1 ≤ l ≤ 2+1=3).

So for the integral to be non-zero, the product must have a component with l=1, because the initial dipole operator has l=1.

Wait, perhaps using the properties of spherical harmonics:

The integral ∫ Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{1, m'} dΩ is non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are met.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the standard selection rules for dipole transitions in hydrogen.

From what I remember, the allowed transitions are those where the dipole matrix element is non-zero. For hydrogen, transitions are allowed when l changes by ±1, and m changes by 0, ±1.

But when the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the dipole operator can induce transitions only to states with l=1 and m=0, because the dipole operator's m=0 component (z) is the only one that has a non-zero integral with the spherically symmetric state.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the initial state is spherically symmetric, so any angular dependence must come from the dipole operator.

The z-component of the dipole operator (Y_{1,0}) would have a non-zero integral with the initial state because Y_{0,0} is isotropic, and Y_{1,0} has a z dependence.

But Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} have dependencies that vary with angle, so their integrals with Y_{0,0} would be zero.

So, in the first transition, the only allowed m1 is 0.

Because the integral of Y_{2, m1}^* Y_{1, m} Y_{0,0} is non-zero only when m=0, leading to m1=0.

So the first transition can only go to m1=0. Therefore, the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>.

Then, the second transition |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.

So the route is 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Which matches options A and D.

Now, the probability. So since the first transition can only go to m1=0, the second transition's probability is the only one to consider.

But what's the probability for each step.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the two-step transition is the product of the two matrix elements' squares.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the probabilities are normalized in a certain way.

Looking at the options, option A has a probability of 1/3, D has 2/3.

Wait, but in reality, the transition from n=3 to n=1 via two steps would have a certain probability, but the options are giving specific fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the sum of the squares of the possible paths. But in this case, since only one path is possible (m1=0), the probability is just the product of the two steps' probabilities.

But I'm not sure about the exact probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible m changes. Since the first transition can only go to m1=0, the probability for that step is 1, and the second step has a probability that depends on the available m transitions.

In the second step, from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>, the dipole operator can cause m changes of 0, ±1.

But the final m is 0. So the dipole operator must provide a delta m of -0 = 0, which is allowed.

So the matrix element is non-zero, and the transition is allowed.

But the exact probability depends on the square of the matrix element. If the dipole operator for the second step has a non-zero matrix element, then the transition is allowed.

But again, without exact calculations, it's hard to say the exact probability.

The options give probabilities of 1/3, 1/4, 1/4, and 2/3.

Wait, perhaps the probability is 1/3 because there are three possible first transitions, but in reality, only one is allowed, so the probability is 1 for the first step, and then the second step's probability would determine the overall.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of the two-step transition is 1/3 because there are three possible paths, but only one is allowed, making the probability 1, but that's not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible options.

Options A and D have the same transition path, but different probabilities.

Option A says the probability is 1/3.

Option D says the probability is 2/3.

Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Assuming that each step has a certain branching probability.

The first transition from 3→2 is to l=1, n=2. The probability for that is a certain value.

The second transition from 2→1 is another certain value.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps it's better to think about the possible number of states.

Wait, another approach: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> are to any state with l=1, so |2,1, m>, with m=-1, 0, +1.

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, only the m=0 component of the dipole operator contributes, making the first transition only to |2,1,0>.

Thus, the first transition's probability is 1, and the second transition's probability is 1 (if it's allowed).

But that can't be the case because the options don't have 1 as an option. So perhaps the second transition has a probability of 1/3 or another fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of the two-step transition is 1/3 because there are three possible two-step paths, each contributing 1/3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible transitions from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>.

The selection rules allow m to change by 0, ±1. So from m=0, the delta m can be 0, -1, +1.

So the dipole operator can cause transitions to m=0, -1, +1. But the final state has m=0, so only the delta m=0 transition is allowed.

Wait, no. Wait, the dipole operator has m components of -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |2,1,0> can go to |1,0,0> only if the dipole operator's m is 0, because 0 (initial m) + m_dipole = final m=0 → m_dipole=0.

So the only component of the dipole operator that allows this transition is the m=0 component.

Thus, the probability of this second transition is the square of the matrix element for m_dipole=0.

Which would be a certain fraction.

If each dipole component has equal probability, the probability would be 1/3.

So the overall probability for the two-step transition is 1 (first step) * 1/3 (second step) = 1/3.

Which would match option A's probability of 1/3.

But wait, earlier I thought that the first transition could only go to m1=0, making the first step probability 1. Then the second transition's probability is 1/3, so the total is 1/3.

That would make option A correct.

But looking at the options, option A's route is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

So the answer would be option A.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis is based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require:

1. **Selection Rules**:  
   - Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum).  
   - Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number).  
   - Δn can be any integer, but transitions between adjacent principal quantum numbers (e.g., n=3 to n=2, and n=2 to n=1) are most probable.  

2. **Initial and Final States**:  
   - Initial state: |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).  
   - Final state: |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).  

3. **Intermediate State**:  
   - The intermediate state must have l=1 (since Δl = ±1).  
   - Possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩, where m = -1, 0, +1.  

4. **First Transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m₁)**:  
   - The dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, and Y_{1,-1}.  
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0), so the transition is allowed only if the dipole operator's m component matches the final state's m.  
   - The transition to m₁ = -1 or m₁ = +1 is forbidden because the integrals involving Y_{1,1} or Y_{1,-1} with the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state vanish.  
   - Only the m₁ = 0 transition is allowed, as it involves the m=0 component of the dipole operator (proportional to Y_{1,0}).  

5. **Second Transition (2,1,0 → 1,0,0)**:  
   - The intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ has m=0.  
   - The dipole operator can cause a Δm = 0 transition, allowing the final state |1,0,0⟩ (m=0).  
   - The transition is allowed, and the probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole operator's m=0 component.  

6. **Overall Probability**:  
   - Since the first transition can only occur to m₁ = 0, the probability of the first step is effectively 1.  
   - The second transition has a probability proportional to the square of the matrix element for the dipole operator's m=0 component.  
   - Assuming equal probabilities for the dipole operator's m components, the second transition has a probability of 1/3.  
   - The total probability for the two-step transition is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: 1 × 1/3 = 1/3.  

7. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.  
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the first transition to m₁ = +1 is forbidden.  
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the first transition to m₁ = -1 is forbidden.  
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 2/3.  

**Conclusion**: The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.  

Answer: A
