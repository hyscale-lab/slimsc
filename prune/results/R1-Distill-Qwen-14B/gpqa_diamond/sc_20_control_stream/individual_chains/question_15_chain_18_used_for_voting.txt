Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transits. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. Both have the same masses, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both orbits are circular.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which probably means it's a bit larger, but they ended up with the same radius. Hmm.

Wait, so the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the orientation of the orbit. But since we detect the planet via RV, we know the mass, but the transit probability is more about the orbital inclination. Oh wait, no, actually, the RV method doesn't tell us the inclination directly. Wait, but for the transit method, the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability of transit depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the orbital parameters.

Wait, the formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / a) * (1/(something)), wait no, I think it's P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right.

Wait, another approach: The probability of a planet transiting is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller because the planet is more likely to pass in front of the star. Or wait, no, actually, the transit probability is higher when the star's size compared to the planet's orbital distance is larger. So, P ≈ (R_*/a) where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (distance from star). Because if the planet's orbit is closer (smaller a), the chances of it passing in front are higher.

Wait, but wait, the planet needs to have an orbital inclination close to 90 degrees for a transit to occur. The probability is proportional to (R_*/a) multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_* / a), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, no, the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. But what's a? a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

But Kepler's law says that a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) ) * P^2 / (4π²). Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_*) (P/(2π))^2. So a is proportional to (M_* * P^2 )^(1/3).

In this problem, the masses of the planets are the same, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has P1 = P/3 (since it's three times shorter than Planet_2's period P2 = 3P1). Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So the transit probability for each planet is P ≈ R/(a), since R_p is negligible.

So for each planet, we can calculate a in terms of their host's mass and period.

Let me write the a for each planet.

For Planet_1: a1^3 = [ G (M1) (P1)^2 ] / (4 π² )
But wait, P1 is (P2 /3), right? Because Planet_1's period is shorter. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

But wait, the question says Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

So for a1: a1^3 = G M1 (P1)^2 / (4 π²) = G (2 M2) ( (P/3) )^2 / (4 π² )

For Planet_2: a2^3 = G M2 (P)^2 / (4 π² )

So taking the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) (P^2 / 9) ] / ( M2 P^2 ) ) = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

Wait, wait a minute, M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host, and M1 is 2 M2. Let me correct that. So M1 = 2 M2, so a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P1^2) / (4 π²). P1 is (P/3), so P1^2 is P²/9.

So a1^3 = [2 M2 * (P²/9) ] / (4 π² )

a2^3 = [ M2 * P² ] / (4 π² )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 (P²/9) ) / (M2 P² ) ) = (2/9) /1 = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. Let me calculate cube root of 2/9.

2/9 ≈ 0.2222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216. So approximately a1 is 0.6 times a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 a2.

Wait, but the transit probability is P = R / a. Since R is the same for both stars (because R1 = R2 = R), the transit probability for each is P1 = R/a1 and P2 = R/a2.

So P1 = R / a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = 1.666... * (R/a2).

But P2 = R/a2.

Wait, so P1 is approximately 1.666 times higher than P2. So P1 is about 1.666 * P2. That would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not getting this backwards.

Wait, because a1 is smaller than a2. Because in Kepler's law, a is proportional to (M_star * P^2 )^(1/3). So for Planet_1, since M1 is 2 M2 and P is 1/3, the a is (2 * (1/3)^2 )^(1/3) times a2.

Wait, wait, let me recompute.

a1^3 = (G * M1) * (P1^2) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G * M2) * (P2^2) / (4 π² )

Given P1 = P2 /3 and M1 = 2 M2.

So a1^3 = (G * 2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )
= (2 M2) * (P2^2 / 9) * G / (4 π² )
= (2/9) M2 P2^2 G / (4 π² )

Similarly, a2^3 = (M2 P2^2 G )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is P1 = R/a1 = R / (0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) (R/a2) = 5/3 (R/a2) ≈ 1.666... times higher than P2.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.666 times that of Planet_2.

Which would mean that Planet_1 is preferred, as it has a higher chance of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's close to 1.666, so that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think: the probability of transit is (R_*/a) * (something). Wait, no, another source I recall says the transit probability is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's R_* / a. So yes, P ∝ R/a. Since R is same for both, P is proportional to 1/a.

But a is smaller for Planet_1, so 1/a is larger, so P is larger. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

So the options are:

A) Planet_2 preferred, ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 preferred, ~1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 preferred, ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 preferred, ~2.7 times.

So according to our calculation, it's ~1.666 times, which matches option C closely (1.65 is close). So the answer should be C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto G M_* P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2's period).
- Planet_1's host star has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.

Using Kepler's law, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{(2M_2) \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R}{a_2}
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

In this problem, the masses of the planets are the same, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has P1 = P/3 (since it's three times shorter than Planet_2's period P2 = 3P1). Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So the transit probability for each planet is P ≈ R/(a), since R_p is negligible.

So for each planet, we can calculate a in terms of their host's mass and period.

Let me write the a for each planet.

For Planet_1: a1^3 = [ G (M1) (P1)^2 ] / (4 π² )
But wait, P1 is (P2 /3), right? Because Planet_1's period is shorter. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

But wait, the question says Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

So for a1: a1^3 = G M1 (P1)^2 / (4 π²) = G (2 M2) ( (P/3) )^2 / (4 π² )

For Planet_2: a2^3 = G M2 (P)^2 / (4 π² )

So taking the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) (P^2 / 9) ] / ( M2 P^2 ) ) = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

Wait, wait a minute, M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host, and M1 is 2 M2. Let me correct that. So M1 = 2 M2, so a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P1^2) / (4 π²). P1 is (P/3), so P1^2 is P²/9.

So a1^3 = [2 M2 * (P²/9) ] / (4 π² )

a2^3 = [ M2 * P² ] / (4 π² )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 (P²/9) ) / (M2 P² ) ) = (2/9) /1 = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. Let me calculate cube root of 2/9.

2/9 ≈ 0.2222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216. So approximately a1 is 0.6 times a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 a2.

Wait, but the transit probability is P = R / a. Since R is the same for both stars (because R1 = R2 = R), the transit probability for each is P1 = R/a1 and P2 = R/a2.

So P1 = R / a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = 1.666... * (R/a2).

But P2 = R/a2.

Wait, so P1 is approximately 1.666 times higher than P2. So P1 is about 1.666 * P2. That would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not getting this backwards.

Wait, because a1 is smaller than a2. Because in Kepler's law, a is proportional to (M_star * P^2 )^(1/3). So for Planet_1, since M1 is 2 M2 and P is 1/3, the a is (2 * (1/3)^2 )^(1/3) times a2.

Wait, wait, let me recompute.

a1^3 = (G * M1) * (P1^2) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G * M2) * (P2^2) / (4 π² )

Given P1 = P2 /3 and M1 = 2 M2.

So a1^3 = (G * 2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )
= (2 M2) * (P2^2 / 9) * G / (4 π² )
= (2/9) M2 P2^2 G / (4 π² )

Similarly, a2^3 = (M2 P2^2 G )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is P1 = R/a1 = R / (0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) (R/a2) = 5/3 (R/a2) ≈ 1.666... times higher than P2.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.666 times that of Planet_2.

Which would mean that Planet_1 is preferred, as it has a higher chance of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's close to 1.666, so that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think: the probability of transit is (R_*/a) * (something). Wait, no, another source I recall says the transit probability is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's R_* / a. So yes, P ∝ R/a. Since R is same for both, P is proportional to 1/a.

But a is smaller for Planet_1, so 1/a is larger, so P is larger. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

So the options are:

A) Planet_2 preferred, ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 preferred, ~1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 preferred, ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 preferred, ~2.7 times.

So according to our calculation, it's ~1.666 times, which matches option C closely (1.65 is close). So the answer should be C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto G M_* P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2's period).
- Planet_1's host star has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.

Using Kepler's law, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{(2M_2) \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R}{a_2}
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
