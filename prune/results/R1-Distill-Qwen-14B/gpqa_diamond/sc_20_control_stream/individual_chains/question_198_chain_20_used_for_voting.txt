Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully again. The problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. They're asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Hmm, I remember that in coordination chemistry, the stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of complexes. 

The given data is: the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the stability of the complex with that many SCN- ligands. 

Wait, what's the order here? I think β1 is for Co(SCN)2^+, β2 is Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on. Or wait, no, maybe the notation is different. Oh right, I think the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n+). So for n=1, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+ with one SCN ligand. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the charge on the complex: each SCN- is -1, so for n ligands, charge is 3+ -n. So for n=1, [Co(SCN)]^2+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^+; n=3, Co(SCN)_3; and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^-.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, right? Which has β2=40. Wait, no, wait: the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, etc. So β1 is for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3], and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^-.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40. So that suggests that each higher n has higher stability. But wait, wait, wait. No, actually, the stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each step, adding another ligand. So, for [Co(SCN)]^2+ (n=1), β1 is the formation constant from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formation in steps. The first complex is Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^2+; β1 is K1 = [ [Co(SCN)^2+ ] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

Similarly, the second complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^+; β2 is K2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2^+] ] / ( [Co(SCN)]^2+ [SCN^-] )

And so on for the third and fourth complexes. So the overall formation constants for each step are β1, β2, β3, β4. 

But wait, when I think about the overall stability, it's the product of the formation constants for each step. So for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n+), the overall formation constant βn is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. 

Wait no, no. Wait, the way it's given, each β is the stepwise constant. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, β3 for the third, and β4 for the fourth. So the overall stability for the complex with four ligands would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. Similarly, for the complex with three ligands, it's β1*β2*β3.

But the problem is, when they're asking about the concentration of dithiocyanato complexes, which have two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex.

So I need to find the fraction of Co^2+ that is in the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ form, compared to all possible forms (including the uncomplexed Co^2+ and all other complexes).

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the octahedral complexes, specifically [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or something else. Wait, maybe I should check the common colors. Oh wait, the problem specifically says blue dithiocyanato, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex? Or perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact colors. But the question states it's the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ligands. So regardless of the color, I need to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ in the solution.

Alright, let's set up the problem. The total cobalt concentration c(Co) is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. We have four possible complexes or species: Co^2+ (free ion), [Co(SCN)]^2+ (monoschelated), [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (dithio), [Co(SCN)_3], and [Co(SCN)_4]^-.

Wait, the possible species are:

- Co^2+ (uncomplexed)
- [Co(SCN)]^2+ (1 SCN)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (2 SCN)
- [Co(SCN)_3] (3 SCN)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^- (4 SCN)

So five species in total.

The problem is to find the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ species in the solution. So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ divided by the sum of all concentrations of all Co species.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. I think the blue is a specific complex, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue. Wait, but the problem statement says 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^+. So the percentage is of that species.

So the first step is to calculate the concentrations of all Co species.

But how? The problem involves multiple complexation steps, each with their own stability constants. So we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

So, let's define the following variables:

Let’s let [Co^2+] = x,

[Co(SCN)]^2+ = y,

[Co(SCN)_2]^+ = z,

[Co(SCN)_3] = w,

[Co(SCN)_4]^- = v.

The total cobalt concentration is x + y + z + w + v = c(Co) = 0.01 M.

Each complex is formed stepwise, so we can express each in terms of the previous one and the [SCN^-].

The formation of the first complex:

y = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

Similarly, the second complex:

z = β2 * y * [SCN^-]

Third complex:

w = β3 * z * [SCN^-]

Fourth complex:

v = β4 * w * [SCN^-]

Wait, no. Wait, each step is the addition of one SCN^- to the previous complex. So for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is formed from [Co(SCN)]^2+ and SCN^-.

So the formation constants are stepwise. So the expression for each species is:

y = β1 x [SCN^-]

z = β2 y [SCN^-] = β2 (β1 x [SCN^-}) [SCN^-] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2

Similarly, w = β3 z [SCN^-} = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3

v = β4 w [SCN^-} = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4

So all species can be expressed in terms of x and the [SCN^-].

Now, the sum x + y + z + w + v = 0.01.

Substituting each term:

x + (β1 [SCN^-] x) + (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 x) + (β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 x) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 x) = 0.01.

Factor out x:

x [1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 ] = 0.01.

Where [S] is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term inside the brackets.

Compute each term one by one:

Compute [S] = 0.1.

Compute each term:

1) 1

2) β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9

3) β1 β2 [S]^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

4) β1 β2 β3 [S]^3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Let's calculate that: 9*40=360. 360 *63= 22680. (0.1)^3=0.001. So 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

5) β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Let me compute that: 9*40=360. 360 *63=22680. 22680 *16=362,880. (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

1) 1

2) 0.9 → sum so far: 1.9

3) 3.6 → sum: 5.5

4)22.68 → sum:28.18

5)36.288 → sum: 64.468.

So the sum inside the brackets is 64.468.

So x = 0.01 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each species:

y = β1 [S] x =9 *0.1 *1.551e-4 = 0.9 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 1.396e-4 M.

z = β1 β2 [S]^2 x =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 * x = 9*40*0.01 * 1.551e-4.

Wait, wait, but earlier we found that z=β1 β2 x [S]^2= (9)(40)(0.1^2) x. Let me compute that.

z=9*40*(0.01) * x = 360 * 0.01 * x =3.6 x.

So 3.6 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 5.5836e-4 M.

Similarly, w= β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 x =9*40*63 *0.1^3 *x = 22680 *0.001 *x=22.68 x.

22.68 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 3.523e-3 M.

v= β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 x=9*40*63*16 *0.1^4 *x= 362880 *0.0001 *x=36.288 x.

36.288 *1.551e-4 ≈ 5.626e-3 M.

Wait, let me double-check these numbers.

Wait, x=1.551e-4.

y=9 *0.1 *x= 0.9 *1.551e-4=1.396e-4.

z=9*40*(0.1)^2 *x= 360 *0.01 *1.551e-4=3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4.

w =9*40*63*(0.1)^3 *x= 22680 *0.001 *1.551e-4=22.68 *1.551e-4≈0.003523 M.

v=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 *x= 362880 *0.0001 *x=36.288 *1.551e-4≈0.005626 M.

So the concentrations are:

x=1.551e-4 M

y=1.396e-4 M

z=5.5836e-4 M

w=0.003523 M

v=0.005626 M.

Wait, let me add them up to check if they sum to 0.01.

x=0.0001551

y=0.0001396

z=0.00055836

w=0.003523

v=0.005626

Adding these: 

0.0001551 + 0.0001396 = 0.0002947

+0.00055836=0.00085306

+0.003523=0.00437606

+0.005626=0.01000206.

Which is approximately 0.01, so that's correct.

Now, the question is the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (z) among all Co species.

z is 5.5836e-4 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So percentage is (z / 0.01) *100 = (5.5836e-4 / 0.01 ) *100 = (0.055836) *100 = 5.5836%.

Wait, that's about 5.58%, which isn't among the options given. Hmmm. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the β values? Let me check the given β values again. The problem states β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the sum of the terms.

Wait, the sum inside the brackets was 64.468?

Let me recalculate the terms.

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: β1 * [S] =9 * 0.1=0.9.

Term3: β1 β2 [S]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

Compute 9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum of terms: 1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. So that part was correct.

So x=0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551.

Then, y=0.9 x=0.9 *1.551e-4=1.396e-4.

z=3.6x=3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4.

Wait, but wait, when I look at the terms, z is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ concentration.

But the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Hmm, maybe I misassigned the β values. Perhaps the dithiocyanato is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, but according to my earlier calculation, it's about 5.5% which doesn't match any option. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. Wait, no, the problem says the stability constants are β1, β2, etc., which are stepwise. Because typically, the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of the stepwise β's. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so [S]=0.1.

Let me recalculate the term for z:

z=β1 β2 [S]^2 x =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 * x = 360 *0.01 * x =3.6 x.

So, with x=1.551e-4, z=3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4 M.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to this, the percentage is 5.58%, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which complex is the dithiocyanato.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? No, that wouldn't make sense. Or perhaps, wait, wait, the problem says 'dithiocyanato', which means two SCN ligands. So it's [Co(SCN)_2]^+. So according to my calculation, that's 5.58%, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Like, β1 is for [CoSCN]^2+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, etc. So the overall stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. But that's not the usual way. Usually, β is stepwise, but perhaps in this case, it's the overall.

Hmm, if that's the case, the approach would be different.

Wait, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of the stepwise β's. So, for example, the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^+ would be β1 * β2.

But if the given β's are the overall stability constants for each [Co(SCN)_n]^m, then the setup is different.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the β's. Let me think. If the β's are the overall stability constants for each complex, then the formation of [Co(SCN)]^2+ is β1=9, meaning the K for Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^2+ is 9.

Then, for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, the overall K would be β2=40, which would mean the formation from Co^2+ and 2 SCN^- is 40.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] would have β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^- would have β4=16.

But if that's the case, then the formula for each species would be:

y = β1 * x * [S]

z = β2 * x * [S]^2

w = β3 *x * [S]^3

v= β4 *x * [S]^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because each complex is built upon the previous one. So the correct approach is that each step adds a ligand.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are the overall stability constants for each complex. That is, βn is the total for the complex with n ligands.

But that's not the usual definition. Usually, βn is the stepwise. So perhaps the problem is presented with the overall β's.

Wait, but the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16'.

So each βn is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n+).

So for [Co(SCN)_1]^2+: β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2]^+: β2=40.

[Co(SCN)_3]^0: β3=63.

[Co(SCN)_4]^-: β4=16.

Wait, that would change the approach. Because in that case, the formation constants are not stepwise but overall.

In that scenario, the expression for each species is:

y = (β1 / ([S])) * x

z = (β2 / ([S]^2)) * x

w = (β3 / ([S]^3)) * x

v = (β4 / ([S]^4)) * x

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the overall formation constant would be for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n+).

So the equilibrium for [Co(SCN)_n] is K = [complex]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So each βn is K for the nth complex.

So the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = βn x [S]^n.

Therefore, the concentrations are:

y = β1 x [S]

z= β2 x [S]^2

w= β3 x [S]^3

v= β4 x [S]^4

Plus the free Co^2+ which is x.

So the total Co is x + y + z + w + v = x (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 ) = 0.01.

So x = 0.01 / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

So let me recompute with this approach.

So [S] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

1) 1

2) β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9

3) β2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

4) β3 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

5) β4 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So sum them up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+0.4=2.3

+0.063=2.363

+0.0016=2.3646.

So x=0.01 / 2.3646 ≈0.004225 M.

Then, the concentrations:

y=β1 [S] x =9 *0.1 *0.004225 =0.9 *0.004225≈0.0038025 M.

z=β2 [S]^2 x=40*(0.1)^2 *0.004225=40*0.01 *0.004225=0.4 *0.004225=0.00169 M.

w=β3 [S]^3 x =63*(0.1)^3 *0.004225=63*0.001 *0.004225=0.063 *0.004225=0.000266 M.

v= β4 [S]^4 x=16*(0.1)^4 *0.004225=16*0.0001 *0.004225=0.0016 *0.004225=0.00000676 M.

So the concentrations are:

x=0.004225 M

y=0.0038025 M

z=0.00169 M

w=0.000266 M

v=0.00000676 M.

Adding them up: 0.004225 + 0.0038025 =0.0080275; +0.00169=0.0097175; +0.000266=0.0099835; +0.00000676=0.00999026. Close to 0.01.

Now, the percentage of z (which is [Co(SCN)_2]^+) is (z / 0.01) *100 = (0.00169 / 0.01)*100 = 16.9%.

Wait, 0.00169 /0.01 is 0.169, so 16.9% which is option D.

Ah, so that's one of the options! So the correct approach must have been to use the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. So the initial assumption was wrong, but this approach gives an option that matches one of the choices.

So why did I get a different answer when using stepwise β's? Because I misinterpreted the β's as stepwise when they're actually overall.

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the stability constants of the complexes are given. So each βn is the stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^m. So the correct approach is the second method, which calculates the sum with the overall βn's multiplied by [S]^n.

Therefore, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^+) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 0.01 \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

The stability constants (\( \beta_n \)) represent the overall equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_n ]^{3-n+}\). The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the following species:
\[
\text{Co}^{2+}, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}]^2+, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^+, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_3], \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^-
\]

The concentrations of these species can be expressed in terms of the total cobalt concentration (\( c(\text{Co}) \)) and the stability constants:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}]^2+ = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-]
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^+ = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_3] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_4^-] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
\[
x + \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 0.01
\]

Factoring out \( x \), we get:
\[
x \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right) = 0.01
\]

Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) and the given \( \beta \) values:
\[
1 + (9)(0.1) + (40)(0.1)^2 + (63)(0.1)^3 + (16)(0.1)^4
\]
\[
= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

Thus:
\[
x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of each species:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = x = 0.004225 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}]^2+ = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] = (9)(0.004225)(0.1) = 0.0038025 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^+ = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (40)(0.004225)(0.1)^2 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_3] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = (63)(0.004225)(0.1)^3 = 0.000266 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_4^-] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = (16)(0.004225)(0.1)^4 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is verified:
\[
0.004225 + 0.0038025 + 0.00169 + 0.000266 + 0.00000676 \approx 0.01 \, \text{M}
\]

The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2 ]^+\) is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^+]}{c(\text{Co})} \times 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]
