Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to figure this out. So the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to get rid of that compound, and they've found the gene responsible. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene's sequence in each.

The intact gene sequence is provided as a long string. Each mutant has some changes in the first exon area. The question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so I think I need to look at each mutant's changes and see which one would disrupt the gene's function. Because if the gene is responsible for making the anti-nutritional compound, then knocking it out (or disrupting its function) would be good.

So the idea is that the compound is made because the gene is functional. If the gene has a mutation that stops it from being expressed or changes its function, the compound might not be made.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact, let me see where the changes are. Oh wait, I'll need to line them up.

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT and ends with TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So let me look at the first part. The first few nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, maybe changes are around the 4th or 5th position. Let's index it.

Wait, the change is in the first exon. So looking at the start, maybe the first 10 or so nucleotides.

Wait, the first part:

Intact: ATG TTC TC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TA CGCT GGT ACT...

Wait, perhaps in Mutant1, the third codon is altered. Let's see:

Looking at the third codon:

Intact: TTT (third codon) perhaps? Or maybe it's the first few codons.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact differences.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ATG TTC TC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, so in Mutant1, the third codon (maybe position 5-7) is changed. The intact has 'CTC' (positions 4-6?), but Mutant1 has 'TAC'?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the exact positions. Let me count.

Let me number the nucleotides:

Intact: 1-3: ATG; 4-6: TTC; 7-9: TC G; 10-12: C GCT?

Wait, perhaps the exact changes are in the third codon. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: each option's mutation. Let's look for which mutation disrupts the reading frame, causes a premature stop codon, or changes an amino acid in a crucial way.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

The change is in the third codon? Let me see.

Original: positions 4-6 are TTC. Then after that, perhaps the next codon changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the first few codons.

Original: ATG TTC TC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So after TTC, the next codon in original is CTC (positions 7-9: CTC?), but in Mutant1, it's TAC (positions 7-9: TAC).

Wait, wait, let me think. The original is ATG TTC TC GCT ... So let's split into codons.

Original:

1-3: ATG (start)

4-6: TTC (Tryptophan)

7-9: TCG (Serine)

10-12: C GCT (but wait, it's the same as the next codon?) Maybe I should see the sequence.

Wait, perhaps the intact gene's first part is:

ATG TTC TC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the first few codons are:

ATG (Met), TTC (Trp), TCG (Ser), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (Stop).

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of TCG (Ser). So the amino acid changes from Ser to Tyr. That's a substitution, but not a frameshift. So it's a missense mutation.

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the original after TTC is TCG, but Mutant 2 has TAA. So let's see:

Original after TTC is TCG, but Mutant2 has TAA. So the third codon is TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So that's a nonsense mutation.

Wait, stop codon early on. So the gene would produce a truncated protein, possibly not functional. If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting it would stop the compound's production.

So Mutant2 would cause a premature stop codon, leading to a shorter protein possibly not functional. That might eliminate the compound.

Mutant3: ATG TTC TT CAG CTG GAC TTC TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, wait, let me look again. Wait, the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the beginning is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG..., so maybe Mutant3 has a different sequence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compare from the beginning.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the third codon is changed. Wait, let me index.

Original: positions 1-3: ATG.

4-6: TTT.

7-9: CTC.

10-12: GCT.

13-15: GGT.

16-18: ACT.

19-21: TCT.

22-24: GTG.

25-27: TGA.

Mutant3:

1-3: ATG.

4-6: TTT.

7-9: TAC.

10-12: GCT.

13-15: GGT.

16-18: GTC (instead of ACT).

19-21: ACT.

22-24: TCT.

25-27: GTG.

So, in Mutant3, the third codon (positions 7-9) is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then also, the 16-18 codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So two changes: one from Leu to Tyr, another from Thr to Val. So these are missense mutations, changing amino acids but not causing a frameshift or stop codon.

So the protein would have two different amino acids. Whether that disrupts function depends. Might be possible, but without a frameshift or stop, the protein is still made but perhaps not functional. Alternatively, maybe it's a less drastic effect than a stop codon.

Mutant4:

Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So let's compare.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the third codon is TAC instead of CTC.

So after the ATG TTT, the next codons are:

Original: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Wait, so the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Also, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same as original. So the first few codons are:

ATG (Met), TTT (Trp), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

So this is a missense mutation in the third codon, leading to a different amino acid. But no stop codon early on. The frame is maintained.

So which mutations are more likely to disrupt the gene function? Well, nonsense mutations (premature stop) are likely to produce nonfunctional proteins. Missense might or might not, depending on which amino acids are changed.

So looking at the options:

Mutant2 has a TAA in the third codon (TAA is a stop codon), so that would lead to a truncated protein. So the gene product might not be functional, which could eliminate the compound.

Mutant1 is a missense, changing Ser to Tyr.

Mutant3 has two missense mutations.

Mutant4 has a missense in third codon.

So the best candidate is Mutant2, because introducing a stop codon early in the gene would disrupt the entire protein beyond that point. If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, this might eliminate it.

Wait, but does the change in Mutant2 really cause a stop? Let me check.

In the intact gene, the first codon is ATG (start), then TTC (Trp), then CTC (Ser), and so on.

Mutant2's sequence: the first part is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So after the start codon, TTC (Trp), then TAA (stop). So the mRNA would be translated as Met-Trp, then stop. The protein would be only two amino acids long. That's way too short to have any function. So the gene product would not be made, hence the compound shouldn't be produced.

So Mutant2 is a strong candidate.

Looking at the options, option A is Mutant2.

So the answer should be A.

To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene and their effects on the gene's function. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's ability to synthesize the compound, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence starts with `ATG TTC TC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...`.  
   - The first codon `ATG` is the start codon (Met).  
   - The sequence continues with `TTC` (Trp), `TCG` (Ser), `GCT` (Ala), `GGT` (Gly), `ACT` (Thr), `TCT` (Ser), `GTG` (Val), and `TGA` (Stop).  

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...`.  
   - The third codon changes from `TCG` (Ser) to `TAC` (Tyr).  
   - This is a **missense mutation**, altering one amino acid but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...`.  
   - The third codon changes from `TCG` (Ser) to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**.  
   - This results in a **premature stop codon**, leading to a truncated protein that is likely nonfunctional.  

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA...`.  
   - The third codon changes from `TCG` (Ser) to `TAC` (Tyr).  
   - The sixth codon changes from `ACT` (Thr) to `GTC` (Val).  
   - These are **missense mutations**, altering two amino acids but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...`.  
   - The third codon changes from `TCG` (Ser) to `TAC` (Tyr).  
   - This is a **missense mutation**, altering one amino acid but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) early in the sequence. This disrupts the gene's ability to produce a functional protein, effectively knocking out the gene's function.

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of TCG (Ser). So the amino acid changes from Ser to Tyr. That's a substitution, but not a frameshift. So it's a missense mutation.

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the original after TTC is TCG, but Mutant 2 has TAA. So let's see:

Original after TTC is TCG, but Mutant2 has TAA. So the third codon is TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So that's a nonsense mutation.

Wait, stop codon early on. So the gene would produce a truncated protein, possibly not functional. If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting it would stop the compound's production.

Wait, wait, let me look again. Wait, the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the beginning is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG..., so maybe Mutant3 has a different sequence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compare from the beginning.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the third codon is changed. Wait, let me index.

Original: positions 1-3: ATG.

4-6: TTT.

7-9: CTC.

10-12: GCT.

13-15: GGT.

16-18: ACT.

19-21: TCT.

22-24: GTG.

25-27: TGA.

Mutant3:

1-3: ATG.

4-6: TTT.

7-9: TAC.

10-12: GCT.

13-15: GGT.

16-18: GTC (instead of ACT).

19-21: ACT.

22-24: TCT.

25-27: GTG.

So, in Mutant3, the third codon (positions 7-9) is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then also, the 16-18 codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So two changes: one from Leu to Tyr, another from Thr to Val. So these are missense mutations, changing amino acids but not causing a frameshift or stop codon.

So the protein would have two different amino acids. Whether that disrupts function depends. Might be possible, but without a frameshift or stop, the protein is still made but perhaps not functional. Alternatively, maybe it's a less drastic effect than a stop codon.

Mutant4:

Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So let's compare.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the third codon is TAC instead of CTC.

So after the ATG TTT, the next codons are:

Original: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Wait, so the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Also, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same as original. So the first few codons are:

ATG (Met), TTT (Trp), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

So this is a missense mutation in the third codon, leading to a different amino acid. But no stop codon early on. The frame is maintained.

So which mutations are more likely to disrupt the gene function? Well, nonsense mutations (premature stop) are likely to produce nonfunctional proteins. Missense might or might not, depending on which amino acids are changed.

So looking at the options:

Mutant2 has a TAA in the third codon (TAA is a stop codon), so that would lead to a truncated protein. So the gene product might not be functional, which could eliminate the compound.

Mutant1 is a missense, changing Ser to Tyr.

Mutant3 has two missense mutations.

Mutant4 has a missense in third codon.

So the best candidate is Mutant2, because introducing a stop codon early in the gene would disrupt the entire protein beyond that point. If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, this might eliminate it.

Wait, but does the change in Mutant2 really cause a stop? Let me check.

In the intact gene, the first codon is ATG (start), then TTC (Trp), then CTC (Ser), and so on.

Mutant2's sequence: the first part is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So Mutant2 is a strong candidate.

Looking at the options, option A is Mutant2.

So the answer should be A.
