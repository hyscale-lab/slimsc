Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5, or N ∝ 1/plx^5. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, right, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/r. So, if I'm given a relationship involving parallax, I can probably convert that into a relationship involving distance.

Let me think. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then substituting that in, N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Oh wait, but wait—the question isn't just about the number of stars as a function of r. It's about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so maybe it's about the number per unit distance, like the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait a second, parallax is in inverse parsecs, so plx = 1/r. So when the parallax is small, the distance is large. So the number of stars is proportional to plx^−5, which is (1/r)^−5 = r^5. So N increases as r^5. But wait, that would mean that as you go further away, you see more stars. But wait, that can't be right because as you look further, the density of stars might decrease because stars are spread out more. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume? Or perhaps it's about the number of stars in a shell of radius r, which would have a surface area proportional to r^2 and thickness dr, so the volume is 4πr^2 dr. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, let me go back. The number of stars N is proportional to r^5. Because N ∝ r^5, so as r increases, N increases rapidly. But the question is about the change per unit distance. So for a small increase in r, how does the number change? Hmm, perhaps it's about the differential number of stars with respect to r.

Wait, if N = k r^5, then the change in number per unit distance, dN/dr, would be 5k r^4. So the number per unit distance (the rate of change) would be proportional to r^4. But that's the differential. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the density, which would be number per unit volume. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is 1/r in parsecs. So plx is in arcseconds, and r is in parsecs. So when plx is small, you're looking far away.

The number of stars N is proportional to plx^-5. So N = C * plx^-5 = C (1/plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N = C (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That's the number of stars as a function of distance.

Now, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number in a thin shell between r and r + dr. That would be the surface area of a sphere times dr, but considering that the number of stars is N(r) per unit volume? Wait, no, that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is the number per unit volume multiplied by the volume of the shell. The number per unit volume would be N/V, where V is the volume up to radius r. But that might not be the right approach here.

Alternatively, since the number of stars N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance (like how many stars are present per parsec, moving radially) would be N divided by r. Wait, N is proportional to r^5, so N/r is r^4. So the number per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. But that's the same as option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The number of stars N in the region is proportional to r^5. So for each increase in r, you're adding more stars proportional to r^5. But the question is about the change per unit distance. So perhaps it's the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N = k r^5, then dN/dr =5 k r^4. So the number of stars increases by 5k r^4 per parsec of distance. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate of change) is r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4, so that would be the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, which would be the derivative.

So the change in N with distance is dN/dr = 5k r^4, so the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is C.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relationship gives:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \).

Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.
