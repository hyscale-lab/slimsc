Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly because I'm not super confident with all these compounds. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. So, element Y must combine with fluorine in five different ways.

Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon usually means that the substance is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon in normal conditions is pretty inert, so if A1 can cause it to react, A1 must be a strong oxidizer.

Wait, what oxidizes xenon? Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. Maybe A1 is a fluoride with a high oxidation state. But wait, it's a binary compound, so Y and F. Oh, perhaps Y is in a high oxidation state.

Then, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. The oF (I think that's the formula weight or maybe the oxidation state?) is 31.96%. Wait, oF might mean the oxidation state of F in A2 is 31.96%, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's the formula weight. Wait, 31.96 is close to the atomic weight of fluorine (about 19), but perhaps it's the percentage composition. If A2 is a compound with Y and F, and the fluorine content is 31.96%, let me think about that.

Wait, maybe oF refers to oxidation state. If fluorine's oxidation state is 31.96%, but that can't be right because oxidation states are integers. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo and should be 31.96% as the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula weight is given. Alternatively, maybe it's the formula of A2. Wait, perhaps A2 is YF3 because 31.96% would be (3*19)/(molar mass of YF3). Wait, let's see. 19*3 is 57. So if YF3 has 57/(Y +57) = 31.96%, then Y +57 = 57/(0.3196) → 57/(0.3196) is about 178. So Y is about 178 -57=121. But that's way too high. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what oF means.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF3, and the molar ratio of F is 31.96% in A2. Wait, so let's say A2 is YF3. Then the percentage of F is (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) *100% =31.96%. Let me calculate that. 3*19=57. So 57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57 =57/0.3196 ≈57/(0.32) ≈178.125. So Y ≈178.125 -57=121.125. That would make Y's atomic weight around 121. But that's way too high for most elements. Hmm. Maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps A2 has a formula where the F is 31.96% by mass. Let's think: if A2 is YF3, then F is 3*19=57. Let me compute Y. So (57/(Y +57)) *100 =31.96 → 57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57=57/0.3196≈57/0.32≈178.125 → Y≈121. So Y is about 121. But that's way beyond the periodic table. The heaviest elements are around 250, but Y is probably not that heavy. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait another approach: what if A1 is YF5, which is a known compound for some elements. For example, ClF3 is a thing, but I'm not sure about others. Alternatively, if A1 is YF4, which is like XeF4 or ClF4? Hmm.

Wait, wait. The problem says that A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride that decomposes into a lower one and F2. For example, XeF4 is a thing, and upon heating, it can decompose. Alternatively, maybe it's ClF3, which decomposes into ClF and F2. Wait, but ClF3 is a yellowish-brown liquid, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe A1 is YF7, which upon heating decomposes into YF5 and F2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine or something else.

Wait, but when the problem says that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions, that suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizer. Xenon is usually unreactive, but it can form compounds under certain conditions. So perhaps A1 is F2 itself, but F2 is a diatomic gas. Hmm, but A1 is a binary compound with Y. So YFₓ.

Wait, perhaps A1 is YF5, which is a known compound for some elements. Upon decomposition, it would break into YF3 and F2, perhaps. Let's say A1 is YF5, which upon heating gives YF3 (A2) and F2. Then, the fluorine content in A2 (YF3) would be (3*19)/(M(YF3)) *100 =31.96%.

So let's compute Y. M(YF3)= Y +3*19 = Y +57. So, (57/(Y+57)) *100 =31.96 → 57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57 =57 /0.3196 ≈178.125 → Y≈121.125. Again, that's too high. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait another angle: the problem says that A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y with F2. So A3 is probably YF2. Because fluorination would add F atoms. So if Y is, say, iodine, then YF3, YF5, etc., are possible. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the problem statement says that A3 can also interact with xenon. So, perhaps A3 is a fluoride that reacts with xenon under certain conditions. Maybe it's a higher fluoride, like YF5, which is a strong enough oxidizer to react with xenon.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the other parts of the question.

The next part: Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF6^3- or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the colorless concentrated solution of A4. Maybe A4 is a solution of HFO4 or something else. Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible substances.

Let me think of the elements. Y is a metal that forms multiple fluorides. Let's think of elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, chlorine forms ClF3, ClF5, etc. But wait, chlorine is a halogen, which is a non-metal. The problem says 'element Y', so maybe Y is a metal.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is iodine. But iodine is a non-metal. Alternatively, maybe Y is O, but O forms only OF2. Hmm. Alternatively, Y could be sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The decomposition of A1 is into A2 and F2. Let's say A1 is YF5. Then, upon heating, it decomposes into YF3 (A2) and F2. So the fluorine percentage in A2 (YF3) is 31.96%.

So, (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) = 0.3196 → 57/(Y+57) =0.3196 → Y +57=57/0.3196 ≈178.125 → Y≈121.125. As before, that's way too high. So perhaps A1 is another fluoride.

Wait, maybe Y is phosphorus? No, because P forms PF3, PF5. But PF5 is a known compound. Let's see, if A1 is PF5, which upon heating decomposes into PF3 and F2. Then, PF3's fluorine content would be (3*19)/(P + 3*19) *100 = ?

Phosphorus has atomic weight about 31. So 3*19=57. So 57/(31+57)=57/88≈0.6477 → 64.77%. But the problem says 31.96%, so that's not matching.

Wait, maybe Y is sulfur. Let's see, if A1 is SF5, which I'm not sure exists, but let's say it does. Then, SF5 → SF3 + F2. The fluorine in SF3 would be (3*19)/(32 +57)=57/89≈0.6404 → 64%, again higher than 31.96%. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe A2 isn't YF3. What if A2 is YF2? Then fluorine percentage is (38)/(Y +38)*100 =31.96. So 38/(Y+38) =0.3196 → Y+38 =38/0.3196≈118.9 → Y≈80.9. That's close to lead (Pb is about 207, but wait, no, 80 is around the atomic weight of mercury? No, Hg is about 201. Wait, no, 80 is around strontium (Sr is ~88), but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, 80 could be something else. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the other parts. When Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. What could that be?

If A4 is a fluoride, perhaps YF6^3− or something. When Y is added, maybe it precipitates as a metal fluoride? Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe A4 is a solution of HFO4 (but that doesn't seem right). Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of H2F2 (difluoro), but that's not a common compound.

Wait, when Y is added to a solution of A4, perhaps it's a metathesis reaction. For example, if A4 is NH4F, adding Y (like Mg) would form MgF2 and NH4Y. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride. For example, if A4 is AlF3, and adding Y (another metal) would form a compound. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about A5. When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. Maybe it's a salt that releases HF or something. For example, if A5 is CaF2, which when added to water doesn't decompose. Hmm. Or if A5 is NaF, same thing. Alternatively, maybe it's a complex fluoride.

Wait, another angle: perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt that contains F− ions, and when Y is added in a 1:1 ratio, it forms a precipitate. For example, if A4 is a solution of AgNO3, adding NaCl would form AgCl precipitate. But in this case, it's Y and A4.

Wait, but the problem says that A5 is obtained by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y gives YF2 (A5), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF3, and adding Y gives YF2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key might be the fluorination. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y with F2. So Y plus F2 gives A3, perhaps YF2. Then, A3 can interact with xenon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal that forms various fluorides. Let me think of elements that form multiple fluorides. Titanium comes to mind, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe Y is silicon? No, silicon forms SiF4, but that's it.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is iodine. Iodine can form IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. So that's five binary compounds with fluorine (IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and maybe another). Hmm, that could fit the five binary compounds.

So, if Y is iodine (I), then A1 could be IF7, which upon heating decomposes into IF5 (A2) and F2. Let me check the fluorine percentage in IF5.

IF5 has I (about 126.9 g/mol) and F (19 each). So I +5F =126.9 +5*19=126.9+95=221.9 g/mol. The fluorine content is 5*19=95, so (95/221.9)*100≈42.86%. But the problem states 31.96%, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a known compound, but Cl is not a metal. Wait, but the problem says element Y, which could be a non-metal. Cl forms ClF3, ClF5, ClF7, maybe others, but I'm not sure if that gives five compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. O forms OF2, O2F2, etc., but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is sulfur. S can form SF2, SF4, SF6. Hmm, that's three, but the problem says five compounds. So maybe Y isn't S.

Wait, maybe Y is carbon? C can form CF2, CF4, CF6, etc., but I don't know about five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal that forms multiple fluorides. For example, titanium forms TiF2, TiF3, TiF4, TiF5, TiF6. So that's five, which fits the problem statement.

So, Y could be titanium (Ti), with atomic weight about 47.9.

Let's check the decomposition of A1. Suppose A1 is TiF7. Upon heating, it decomposes into TiF5 (A2) and F2. Let's calculate the fluorine percentage in TiF5.

TiF5: Ti (47.9) +5F (5*19=95) → molar mass 47.9+95=142.9 g/mol. Fluorine percentage is (95/142.9)*100≈66.47%. But the problem says 31.96%, so that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe A1 is TiF5 decomposing into TiF3 and F2. So, A1 is TiF5, A2 is TiF3.

TiF3: 47.9 + 3*19=47.9+57=104.9 g/mol. F percentage is (57/104.9)*100≈54.34%. Again, higher than 31.96%. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps Y is another metal. Let's think of lead (Pb) but I don't think Pb forms five fluorides.

Wait, maybe Y is iron? Iron forms FeF2, FeF3, perhaps others, but I'm not sure about five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sodium. Wait, sodium forms NaF, but not multiple fluorides. So that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps Y is calcium. Ca forms CaF2. That's only one, so no.

Wait, perhaps Y is aluminum. Al forms AlF3. Only one.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me try another approach.

The problem says that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with F2. So A3 is YFx, and it can react with xenon. So perhaps YF3 is A3, which can react with Xe.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the other parts again.

When Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 ratio, A5 is obtained. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So maybe A4 is a solution of YF6^3−, and when Y is added, it precipitates as YF2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a solution of HFO4 (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of H2FO3, which when Y is added (maybe as a metal) would form a fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride of hydrogen, like hydrofluoric acid (HF), but that's a gas, not a solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a salt that contains F−, like NaF. But adding Y (a metal) would displace F− as HF, perhaps. So if Y is more reactive than sodium, it would replace F−, forming YF and NaY. But the molar ratio is 1:1, so perhaps the reaction is Y + NaF → NaY + YF. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the molecular weight of A4. The options are 140-160, 220-240, 160-180, 110-130.

If A4 is a solution of a fluoride, what's its molecular weight? For example, if A4 is YF6, then molecular weight is Y +6*19 = Y +114. So if Y is around 100, then A4 would be 214, which is in option B (220-240). But I don't know Y's atomic weight yet.

Wait, earlier I thought Y might be a metal like titanium (atomic weight ~48). Then YF6 would be 48 + 114 = 162. That's in option C (160-180). So perhaps that's the right range.

But how does that fit into the other parts?

If A4 is TiF6, which isn't a commonly known compound, but for the sake of the problem, let's say it exists. Then, adding Ti (Y) in a 1:1 ratio would give TiF (assuming a reaction like Ti + TiF6 → 2 TiF3, but I'm not sure).

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a different compound. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A5 in water gives two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that releases HF when water is added. For example, CaF2 is insoluble in water, but perhaps other fluorides are more reactive.

Wait, perhaps A5 is NH4F. When it decomposes in water, it just dissociates into NH4+ and F−. But that doesn't form two substances. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a complex fluoride that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is Na2TiF6, which upon hydrolysis gives NaF and TiO2 or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the options. The options are about the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is YF6, and Y is around 100, then YF6 would be 100+114=214. Which falls into option B (220-240). But Y can't be 100 because that's around the atomic weight of Zr (zirconium is about 91) or maybe something else.

Wait, if Y is about 90, then YF6 would be 90+114=204. Still in option B. Hmm.

Alternatively, if Y is about 120, then YF6 would be 120+114=234, which is within option B.

But earlier, when trying to calculate Y's atomic weight based on the fluorine percentage in A2, I got Y around 121, which would make YF6's molecular weight about 235, which is option B.

But then, I'm not sure about Y being 121. Because the periodic table doesn't have an element with that atomic weight. Oh wait, maybe Y is astatine? No, astatine is around 210. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is astatine (At), which is a halogen. But astatine is a non-metal. Let's see. If Y is At, then AtF7 would be A1, which upon heating decomposes into AtF5 (A2) and F2. Then, the fluorine percentage in A2 would be (5*19)/(At +5*19) *100 =31.96%.

At has an atomic weight of about 210. So 5*19=95. 95/(210 +95) =95/305 ≈0.3114 → 31.14%. Close to 31.96%, but not exact. Hmm.

But perhaps Y is another element. Alternatively, maybe Y is astatine but with a different formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is astatine. Let's see, if Y is At, then its fluorides would be AtF, AtF3, AtF5, AtF7, and perhaps AtFn. So five binary compounds. That fits the first condition.

So A1 is AtF7, which upon heating decomposes into AtF5 and F2. The fluorine percentage in AtF5 would be (5*19)/(210 +5*19) *100 = (95)/(210 +95)=95/305 ≈31.14%, which is close to the given 31.96%. Maybe it's an approximate value, so that could work.

If that's the case, then A4's molecular weight would be that of AtF6, which is 210 +6*19=210+114=324. But that's higher than any of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe I should think about another element. Let's think of Y as chlorine, which is a non-metal. Cl forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7, but that's four, I think, unless another exists. If so, five compounds could fit. Then, A1 would be ClF7, which upon heating decomposes into ClF5 and F2. Let's check the fluorine percentage in ClF5.

Cl's atomic weight is about 35.5. So ClF5's molar mass is 35.5 +5*19=35.5 +95=130.5. Fluorine percentage is (95/130.5)*100≈72.8%, which is higher than 31.96%. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options for A4's molecular weight are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

If A4 is YF6, and Y's atomic weight is around 100 (like tin, which is around 118.71), then YF6 would be 118.71 + 6*19=118.71 +114=232.71, which is in option B (220-240). So if Y is tin, then A4 would have a molecular weight around 233, which is option B.

But wait, tin (Sn) is a metal. Does tin form multiple fluorides? Let me think. Tin can form SnF2, SnF4, SnF6. That's three, but the problem says five. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is lead (Pb), which has a molar mass of about 207.2. PbF6 would be 207.2 +114=321.2, which is way beyond any option.

Hmm, perhaps Y is something else. Let me think of elements with molar mass around 100. For example, zinc is about 65.4, so ZnF6 would be 65.4+114=179.4, which falls into option C (160-180). So A4 would be ZnF6, with a molecular weight of ~179.4.

But does zinc form ZnF6? I'm not sure. Zinc typically forms ZnF2, maybe ZnF4, but ZnF6 might not be common. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, if Y is molybdenum (Mo), which has a molar mass of about 95.95, then MoF6 would be 95.95+114=209.95, which is in option B (220-240)? No, 209 is just under B. So maybe not.

Wait, but the options are ranges. 209.95 is close to 220, but not quite. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is krypton? No, because krypton is a noble gas and doesn't form many compounds.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think differently. If A4's molecular weight is around 160-180 (option C), what could that be?

If A4 is YF4, then Y's molar mass would be 160-180 -4*19=160-76=84; 180-76=104. So Y would be between 84 and 104. Elements in that range include strontium (Sr, ~88), yttrium (~89), zirconium (~91), etc.

If Y is zirconium (Zr, ~91), then YF4 would be 91 +4*19=91+76=167, which falls into option C (160-180). So A4 would be ZrF4, molecular weight 167. That fits option C.

But I'm not sure if ZrF4 is a known compound. Alternatively, Zr can form ZrF2, ZrF4, ZrF6, etc., so maybe that's possible.

Let me check the decomposition: if A1 is ZrF6, which upon heating decomposes into ZrF4 (A2) and F2. Then, the fluorine percentage in ZrF4 would be (4*19)/(91+76)=76/167 ≈45.5%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track again.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF3. Its molecular weight would be Y +57. If that's in option C (160-180), Y would be 160-57=103 to 180-57=123. So Y would be around 103-123. Elements in that range include Sn (~118), Sb (~122), etc.

If Y is tin (Sn, ~118), then SnF3 would have a molecular weight of 118 +57=175, which is in option C (160-180). So A4 would be SnF3, molecular weight 175.

But does Sn form SnF3? I think tin typically forms SnF2 and SnF4. SnF3 might not be a common compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's summarize.

The problem states that A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, with A2 having 31.96% fluorine. We tried several Y elements and their fluorides, but none quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is astatine, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, another approach: the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%. Let's compute the possible formula and molar mass.

Let me denote the formula of A2 as YFₓ. So the fluorine percentage is (19x)/(M(YFₓ)) *100 =31.96.

Let me rearrange this: (19x) = 0.3196 * M(YFₓ).

But M(YFₓ) = Y + 19x.

So,

19x = 0.3196*(Y +19x)

Let's expand that:

19x =0.3196 Y + 0.3196 *19x

19x -0.3196*19x = 0.3196 Y

19x (1 -0.3196) =0.3196 Y

19x *0.6804 =0.3196 Y

So,

Y = (19x *0.6804)/0.3196

Let me compute that:

19 *0.6804 ≈12.9276

12.9276x /0.3196 ≈40.47x

So Y ≈40.47x.

Since Y must be an integer (atomic number), and x must be an integer (number of F atoms), let's think of possible x.

Let me try x=3.

Y≈40.47*3=121.4. Close to 121, which is around Te (tellurium, ~127.6). Hmm.

x=2: Y≈80.94, which is close to strontium (Sr, ~87.62) or yttrium (~88.91).

x=4: Y≈40.47*4=161.88. That's beyond the periodic table for a single element. So x=4 is probably too high.

x=1: Y≈40.47. That would be around Zr (~91), but 40 is closer to titanium (47.87). Hmm.

Wait, but with x=3, Y≈121, which is close to tellurium (Te, ~127.6). Let's check the fluorine percentage in TeF3.

TeF3's molar mass is 127.6 +3*19=127.6 +57=184.6. Fluorine percentage is (57/184.6)*100≈30.9%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, not exact, but perhaps the problem allows for approximation.

So if Y is Te (tellurium), then A2 is TeF3, with a molecular weight of 184.6, which is in option C (160-180)? Wait, 184.6 is just above 180, so it would fall into option C (160-180) if the upper limit is inclusive. Or perhaps the option is up to 180. So 184.6 would be just outside option C.

Hmm, that's a bit of a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else. Let's think of x=3 and Y=120, which would give a fluorine percentage of (57/ (120+57)) *100 =57/177≈32.2%, which is close to 31.96%. So Y would be ~120, which is tin (Sn, ~118.71).

So, if Y is Sn (tin), then A2 is SnF3, which has a molecular weight of 118.71 +57=175.71, which is in option C (160-180). That fits.

So, A4 would be another tin fluoride. Let's say A4 is SnF4, which has a molecular weight of 118.71 +4*19=118.71+76=194.71. That falls into option C (160-180)? No, 194 is above 180. So A4 would have a molecular weight of around 194.71, which doesn't fit any of the options.

Hmm, but maybe A4 is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF2, which would have a molecular weight of 118.71+38=156.71, which is in option C (160-180) if the lower limit is inclusive.

Wait, 156.71 is just below 160. So it's in option D (110-130) for SnF2? No, wait, 156.71 is between 140-160. So option A is 140-160. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SnF6, which would have a molecular weight of 118.71 +6*19=118.71 +114=232.71, which is in option B (220-240).

But earlier calculations suggested that A4's molecular weight is around 175 (SnF3), which is in option C. But this is getting confusing.

Wait, let me recap. If Y is tin (Sn), then:

- A2 is SnF3, molecular weight ~175.71 → option C (160-180).

- A4 is SnF6, molecular weight ~232.71 → option B (220-240).

But the problem is about A4's molecular weight, so I need to find which option that falls into.

But earlier, the question says that when Y is added in a 1:1 ratio to a concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. So perhaps A4 is SnF6, and adding Sn gives SnF2 and releases something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of SnF4. Adding Sn (as a metal) could reduce it to SnF2, but I'm not sure.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the earlier calculations.

If Y is tin (Sn), and A4 is SnF6, its molecular weight is 232.71, which is in option B (220-240). So the answer would be option B.

Alternatively, if A4 is SnF4 (molecular weight 194.71), which is higher than option B's upper limit (240), perhaps I'm wrong.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll go with option C (160-180) based on A4 being SnF3 or another compound.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. The analysis begins by identifying Y as an element that forms five binary fluorides, as stated in the question. Key clues include the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2, with A2 having 31.96% fluorine by mass, and the interaction of A3 and A5 with xenon and water, respectively.

1. **Identifying Y and A2**:  
   - A1 is a bright-red compound that decomposes into A2 and F2. A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass. Assuming A2 is YFₓ, the fluorine percentage formula is used:  
     \[
     \text{Fluorine percentage} = \frac{19x}{Y + 19x} \times 100 = 31.96
     \]
     Solving for \(Y\), it is found that \(Y \approx 120\), which aligns with tin (Sn, atomic weight ~118.71). Thus, A2 is likely SnF₃, with a molecular weight of \(118.71 + 57 = 175.71\), placing it in the range 160–180.

2. **Determining A4**:  
   - A4 is a concentrated solution of a fluoride. When Y (tin) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances, suggesting a hydrolysis reaction. If A4 is SnF₆, its molecular weight is \(118.71 + 6 \times 19 = 232.71\), which falls into the range 220–240. However, SnF₆ is less likely due to its higher molecular weight and the problem's emphasis on A4's range.

3. **Analyzing Options**:  
   - **Option A (140–160)**: This range does not fit A4 if it is SnF₃ or SnF₆.  
   - **Option B (220–240)**: This range fits SnF₆ (232.71), but SnF₆ is less consistent with the decomposition behavior described.  
   - **Option C (160–180)**: This range fits SnF₃ (175.71), which aligns with the decomposition and fluorination conditions.  
   - **Option D (110–130)**: This range is too low for A4, given the molecular weights of tin fluorides.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations and the consistency of SnF₃ with the given conditions, A4 is most likely in the range 160–180.
