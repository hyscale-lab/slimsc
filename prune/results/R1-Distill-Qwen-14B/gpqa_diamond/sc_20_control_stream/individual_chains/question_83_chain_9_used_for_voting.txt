Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what's happening at these two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, when they say 25% titration, does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH? Or 25% of the volume? I think it's 25% of the moles, because titration usually refers to the reaction progress. But maybe I should double-check that later.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the moles of acetic acid and then see how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.
3. For each scenario (25% and equivalence), set up the appropriate chemistry (like buffer solution or salt solution) and calculate the pH.

Starting with step 1: the initial concentration after dilution.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water doubles the volume. So the new concentration is half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial acetic acid solution is 20 cm³. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So yes, the concentration is halved.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present.

So first, let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Molarity = moles/volume(L). So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

Molarity is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L.

Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added would be 0.001 moles.

But wait, wait. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence can be found by moles = M * V. So V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But I'm not sure if that's needed right now. Let's get back.

Next, let's think about 25% titration. That would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

So, at 25% titration, we have some acetic acid left and some acetate ions (the conjugate base) formed.

Because the solution will be a buffer solution (mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

But first, let me find pKa. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/Ka) = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73.

Wait, because 1e-5 has pKa 5, and 1.85 is close to 2, so maybe around 4.73?

Wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.41e4) ≈ 4.7325. So approximately 4.73.

So, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, so 75% remains as acetic acid, and 25% has been converted to acetate.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 25% /75% = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.3333).

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; option D is 4.57. So maybe the first part is 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the calculation.

Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333, log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So 4.73 - 0.477 is 4.253, which is about 4.25. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.25 or 4.26? Since 0.003 is negligible. So 4.26? So option A says 4.26 and 8.52; option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: maybe the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added? Because sometimes in titration, the percentage can be by volume, but I think in this context, it refers to the mole percentage. Because if you add 25% of the volume needed for equivalence, the moles would be 25% of the equivalence moles. So that would make it the same as 25% of the moles. So I think the initial approach is correct.

So at 25%, pH is around 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will contain sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated.

At equivalence, total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but when calculating the concentration, you have to consider the total volume.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 moles, as we calculated earlier. The volume of NaOH needed is 10 cm³ (since 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles). So total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate ions is moles / volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Now, since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the Kb is 5.405e-10, which is a very small number, so the hydrolysis will be minimal, and we can approximate using the formula:

OH^- concentration ≈ sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of acetate.

So, C is 0.02 M.

So, OH^- = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa is ~4.73.

Then, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb expression is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = Kb.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let's compute that.

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983.

pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

But none of the options have a pH around 9. Let me look again at the options.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm. So the equivalence point pH I'm getting is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the volume. Let's recheck the volumes.

At equivalence, the volume of NaOH added is 10 cm³. The initial solution is 40 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of Kb. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405405e-10.

So Kb = 5.4054e-10.

C = 0.02 M.

x^2 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) = approximately 1.04e-5, as before.

pOH is about 4.98, pH is about 9.02.

Wait, none of the options show that. So what's wrong here?

Wait, another approach: maybe I should consider that the solution isn't just the acetate ion but a sodium salt. Sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect pH. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that at equivalence, the solution is not just the acetate but maybe some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of acetate.

Wait, another possibility: when calculating the pH at equivalence, perhaps I should have considered that the concentration isn't 0.02 M? Let me recheck the moles and volume.

Initially, the diluted acetic acid has 0.025 M in 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so moles of acetic acid is 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, we've added 0.001 mol of NaOH, which reacts with 0.001 mol of acetic acid to form 0.001 mol of acetate.

The total volume after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH is 40 +10=50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the pOH calculation.

Wait, let's compute pOH more accurately.

[OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let me compute log(1.04) and add.

Log(1.04) is approximately 0.017.

So log(1.04e-5) is log(1.04) + log(1e-5) = 0.017 + (-5) )= -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 -4.983 = 9.017 ≈ 9.02.

Hmm. So equivalence pH is around 9.02, but none of the options go that high. The options at equivalence are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So none match.

So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Maybe the assumption that 25% titration refers to 25% of the moles is incorrect. Maybe it refers to 25% of the NaOH volume added. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the 25% is by volume of NaOH added to the total solution. Let me consider that.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the 25% titration refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So if the equivalence requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, then 25% would be 2.5 cm³ added.

So let's recalculate the pH at 25% titration based on that.

So, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Which is 25% of the 0.001 mol needed for equivalence.

So same as before: 0.00025 mol NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol acetic acid to produce 0.00025 mol acetate.

The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333, same as before.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 -0.477 = 4.253 → pH ≈4.25.

So same result as before.

Hmm. So the equivalence point pH is about 9.02, but no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution at equivalence. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but maybe some other salt? No, because NaOH is a strong base and acetic acid is weak, so it would form sodium acetate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact expression without approximations.

For the equivalence point:

The solution is 0.02 M acetate. So the reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02, since x is very small.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.983 → pH ≈9.017.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't at equivalence but at another point. Alternatively, perhaps the initial dilution is miscalculated.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * (20e-3 L) = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted with 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That part seems correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that at equivalence, it's not just acetate but the solution is more dilute, but that can't be. No, the calculation seems right.

Wait, but looking at the options, the equivalence pH for option D is 6.92, which is acidic, which doesn't make sense because sodium acetate should give a basic solution. So perhaps I'm wrong in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but something else. Wait, no, because NaOH is a strong base, and acetic acid is weak, so the neutralization produces acetate and water.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the equivalence point isn't when all the acetic acid is neutralized but when the moles are equal. Oh wait, that's correct. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence involves the autoionization of water or some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, but I thought that was the same as 25% of the moles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the pH at 25% of the NaOH volume added, not 25% of the moles. So let's try that.

At equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is needed. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, how much has reacted?

Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Which reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So same as before. So same pH as before, 4.25.

So that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial dilution is calculated incorrectly. Let me recheck.

Dilution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Concentration after dilution: (20 cm³) * 0.05 M = 1 mmol? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol, correct.

So when diluted to 40 cm³, 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. At equivalence, 6.92 is acidic. That can't be right because sodium acetate is a base, so pH should be above 7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach to equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but the solution is a buffer. No, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact equation without approximation.

Wait, Kb =5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

Let me write the expression again:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5 M.

pOH = 4.983 → pH=9.017.

Hmm, still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that we're using a 0.1 M NaOH solution, and perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, no. 0.1 M NaOH for 10 cm³ is 0.001 mol.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution is being considered for the equivalence point, but maybe the initial concentration is calculated incorrectly.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted to 40 cm³: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence pH.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the concentration in the original solution before adding NaOH, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the Ka and not approximate pKa.

Wait, let me compute the pH more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is a sodium acetate solution, but the pH is calculated incorrectly. Let me recompute.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.983 → pH=9.017.

So no, I don't see a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is more concentrated, but the volume is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem asks for the pH at 25% of the initial solution's volume, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the half-equivalence point, but that's when half the acetic acid is neutralized, which would be 50% titration, not 25%.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

The only option where the equivalence pH is close to my calculation is none, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Or perhaps the question is about something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when we dilute the acetic acid, the pH changes, and the titration starts from that pH. So the initial pH after dilution is different, and perhaps the titration calculations take that into account.

Wait, let me compute the initial pH after dilution.

The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

The pH can be calculated using the formula for weak acids:

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA]

Assuming x is the [H+]:

Ka = x²/(0.025 - x) ≈ x²/(0.025) → x = sqrt( Ka * 0.025 )

Ka is 1.85e-5.

So x = sqrt(1.85e-5 * 0.025 ) = sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 0.00068 M.

pH = -log(0.00068) ≈ 3.17.

Hmm, which is one of the options. Option B starts with 3.17. But the question is about the pH during titration, not the initial pH. So that's probably not relevant.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The options are for the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

My calculation for 25% titration is about 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is way below what I calculated.

So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in a different way. Let me think.

Wait, 25% titration: perhaps the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.

So that's correct.

At equivalence, the pH is about 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck.

Wait, initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the equivalence point is when the solution is half-neutralized, but that would be the half-equivalence point. No, the equivalence is when all is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps during the titration, the solution is heated, but the problem states 25°C, so that shouldn't affect it.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the exact concentration without considering that the volumes are additive. But that's a minor effect and shouldn't change the result dramatically.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me recalculate:

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate.

But wait, acetate is a weak base. So let's calculate the pH.

Using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = 4.98 → pH=9.02.

Still no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not at room temperature, but the problem states 25°C, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the NaOH is 0.1 M, but the volume is in liters. Wait, no: 25 cm³ is 0.025 L, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial dilution is incorrect.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is that when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is halved, so 0.025 M. So the initial pH is around 3.17, as I calculated earlier.

But during titration, when 25% is added, the pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps the problem is that the equivalence point is actually when NaOH is added beyond the equivalence point. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is actually a buffer. Wait, no, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the pH using exact values without any approximations. Let me try that.

For equivalence point:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Set up the equation:

x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

No change.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the pH at equivalence point when a weak acid is titrated with a strong base, which can also be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. pKa + pKb =14, so (pKa + pKb)/2 =7. So pH=7 is incorrect. At equivalence, the solution is basic, so pH>7.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] ) → but wait, that's the Henderson equation.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is converted to base, so [base]/[acid] is infinity, which would give pH = pKa + log(inf) → pKa + something large, which would be near 14, which isn't the case.

Wait, but that's not applicable here. Because when all the acid is neutralized, the solution is just the conjugate base.

So I think my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution after dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let me compute it again.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M → 0.05 *0.02 L=0.001 mol.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 /0.04 L=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the initial concentration before any dilution or titration, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 25% titration refers to 25% of the solution's volume, not of the moles. Let me think.

But that's the same as 25% of the moles, because the concentration is the same across the solution. So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option D has pH 4.57 at 25% and 6.92 at equivalence. But 6.92 is below 7, which can't be correct as the equivalence point should be basic.

Option A: 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. 8.52 is close to my calculated 9.02 but still a bit lower. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the equivalence pH more accurately.

Let me compute the exact pH without assuming x is negligible.

Equation: x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 M.

[OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983 → pH=9.017.

Hmm. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck the initial dilution.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → moles =0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I'll look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution has a pH that's different from what I calculated, and that's affecting the titration calculations. But for the titration, the relevant point is the moles, not the initial pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at 25% titration isn't a buffer. Let me think.

No, because at 25% titration, part of the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate, so it's a buffer.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to see if any option's equivalence pH is close to my calculation.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I'm wrong about the approach.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point is when the NaOH is in excess. No, because equivalence is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the initial concentration before any dilution, which would be 0.05 M. But that would change everything.

Wait, if the initial solution is 0.05 M and 20 cm³, then after adding 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.025 M, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of Ka instead of pKa.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.73.

At 25% titration, [A^-]/[HA] =1/3.

So pH=4.73 + log(1/3) =4.73 -0.477=4.253.

So pH≈4.25, which matches option A's first value.

At equivalence, the pH is about 9.02, but no option matches. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, which has 4.57, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the initial pH after dilution as part of the calculation.

Wait, the initial pH after dilution is about 3.17, as I calculated earlier. But that's before any titration.

Hmm. I'm really confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach for the equivalence point. Maybe the solution is a buffer of acetate and acetic acid, but that's not the case. At equivalence, all the acid is converted to acetate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but some other factor like activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, Ka =1.85e-5 → Kw=1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the equivalence point pH is around 8.52 as in option A, and see if that makes sense.

If pH is 8.52, then pOH=5.48 → [OH-]=2.69e-6 M.

Then, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) → 2.69e-6 = sqrt(5.405e-10 * C ).

Square both sides: (2.69e-6)^2 =5.405e-10 * C → 7.23e-12 =5.405e-10 * C → C=7.23e-12 /5.405e-10 → C≈0.0134 M.

But earlier, the concentration was 0.02 M, which would give a higher pH. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute what concentration would give pH 8.52.

pH=8.52 → pOH=5.48 → [OH-]=2.69e-6 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] = (2.69e-6)^2 / (0.02 - 2.69e-6) ≈ (7.23e-12)/(0.02) → 3.615e-10.

But the actual Kb is 5.405e-10. So that's lower than calculated, which suggests that the concentration is higher than 0.02 M.

Hmm. So to get [OH-] =2.69e-6, we need a higher concentration than 0.02 M, which isn't the case here. So this can't be correct.

Hmm. So I'm back to the conclusion that the equivalence pH should be around 9.02, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option A (4.26;8.52), but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but some other factor. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M acetate but a different concentration. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³ (40+10), so 0.05 L. 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I'll look for another approach. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the pH calculated using the same approach as the half-equivalence point.

Wait, at the half-equivalence point, pH=pKa=4.73. That's in option C and D.

But the question is about 25% and equivalence, not half.

Hmm. So I think the correct pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is around 9.02. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the initial acetic acid concentration before dilution, which is 0.05 M, not 0.025 M. Let me try that.

If initial concentration is 0.05 M and volume 20 cm³, moles=0.001. After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume 40 cm³, concentration 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. So same as before.

Hmm. I don't think that's the issue.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution after dilution is titrated, and the initial pH is lower, but that doesn't affect the titration's pH calculations.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time. I'll go with the calculations I did. The pH at 25% is about 4.26, and equivalence is about 9.02, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which has 4.26 and 8.52. But I'm not sure why the equivalence would be 8.52.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence calculation. Maybe I should re-calculate Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Let x be [OH^-].

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 M.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. So I don't see another way. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.

But looking at the options, the only one that matches the 25% titration pH is option A (4.26) and D (4.57). But my calculation says 4.26, so perhaps option A is the intended answer, even though the equivalence pH doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at 25% of the solution's volume, not 25% of the moles. Let me try that.

Wait, 25% of the solution's volume would be 10 cm³ added, but that's the same as 25% of the moles, as earlier.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, I think the correct pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 9.02. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option A: 4.26 and 8.52. But I'm not sure why the equivalence pH would be 8.52. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just acetate, but perhaps some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate the Kb.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll conclude that option A is the intended answer, even though the equivalence pH doesn't seem right.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, resulting in a concentration of 0.025 M.

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. This means 25% of the moles of acetic acid (0.00025 mol) have been converted to acetate ions, leaving 75% of the acetic acid (0.00075 mol) unreacted. The total volume of the solution is now 42.5 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added). The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is now 50 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 10 cm³ of NaOH added). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water, and its hydrolysis can be analyzed using the \(K_b\) value:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b\) and \([\text{A}^-]\):

\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this calculated pH. The closest option for the equivalence point is **8.52** in option A, though this value is inconsistent with the calculations.

---

### Final Answer
Based on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, which matches option A. While the equivalence point calculation predicts a pH of approximately 9.02, the closest option provided is **8.52**. Therefore, the intended answer appears to be:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what's happening at these two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, when they say 25% titration, does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH? Or 25% of the volume? I think it's 25% of the moles, because titration usually refers to the reaction progress. But maybe I should double-check that later.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the moles of acetic acid and then see how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.
3. For each scenario (25% and equivalence), set up the appropriate chemistry (like buffer solution or salt solution) and calculate the pH.

Starting with step 1: the initial concentration after dilution.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water doubles the volume. So the new concentration is half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial acetic acid solution is 20 cm³. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So yes, the concentration is halved.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present.

So first, let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Molarity = moles/volume(L). So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

Molarity is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L.

Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added would be 0.001 moles.

But wait, wait. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence can be found by moles = M * V. So V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But I'm not sure if that's needed right now. Let's get back.

Next, let's think about 25% titration. That would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

So, at 25% titration, we have some acetic acid left and some acetate ions (the conjugate base) formed.

Because the solution will be a buffer solution (mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

But first, let me find pKa. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/Ka) = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73.

Wait, because 1e-5 has pKa 5, and 1.85 is close to 2, so maybe around 4.73?

Wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.41e4) ≈ 4.7325. So approximately 4.73.

So, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, so 75% remains as acetic acid, and 25% has been converted to acetate.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 25% /75% = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.3333).

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; option D is 4.57. So maybe the first part is 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the calculation.

Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333, log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So 4.73 - 0.477 is 4.253, which is about 4.25. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.25 or 4.26? Since 0.003 is negligible. So 4.26? So option A says 4.26 and 8.52; option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: maybe the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added? Because sometimes in titration, the percentage can be by volume, but I think in this context, it refers to the mole percentage. Because if you add 25% of the volume needed for equivalence, the moles would be 25% of the equivalence moles. So that would make it the same as 25% of the moles. So I think the initial approach is correct.

So at 25%, pH is around 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will contain sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated.

At equivalence, total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but when calculating the concentration, you have to consider the total volume.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 moles, as we calculated earlier. The volume of NaOH needed is 10 cm³ (since 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles). So total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate ions is moles / volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Now, since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the Kb is 5.405e-10, which is a very small number, so the hydrolysis will be minimal, and we can approximate using the formula:

OH^- concentration ≈ sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of acetate.

So, C is 0.02 M.

So, OH^- = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa is ~4.73.

Then, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb expression is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = Kb.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let's compute that.

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983.

pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

But none of the options have a pH around 9. Let me look again at the options.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm. So the equivalence point pH I'm getting is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the volume. Let's recheck the volumes.

At equivalence, the volume of NaOH added is 10 cm³. The initial solution is 40 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of Kb. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405405e-10.

So Kb = 5.4054e-10.

C = 0.02 M.

x^2 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) = approximately 1.04e-5, as before.

pOH is about 4.98, pH is about 9.02.

Wait, none of the options show that. So what's wrong here?

Wait, another approach: maybe I should consider that the solution isn't just the acetate ion but a sodium salt. Sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect pH. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that at equivalence, the solution is not just the acetate but maybe some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of acetate.

Wait, another possibility: when calculating the pH at equivalence, perhaps I should have considered that the concentration isn't 0.02 M? Let me recheck the moles and volume.

Initially, the diluted acetic acid has 0.025 M in 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so moles of acetic acid is 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, we've added 0.001 mol of NaOH, which reacts with 0.001 mol of acetic acid to form 0.001 mol of acetate.

The total volume after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH is 40 +10=50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the pOH calculation.

Wait, let's compute pOH more accurately.

[OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let me compute log(1.04) and add.

Log(1.04) is approximately 0.017.

So log(1.04e-5) is log(1.04) + log(1e-5) = 0.017 + (-5) )= -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 -4.983 = 9.017 ≈ 9.02.

Hmm. So equivalence pH is around 9.02, but none of the options go that high. The options at equivalence are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So none match.

So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Maybe the assumption that 25% titration refers to 25% of the moles is incorrect. Maybe it refers to 25% of the NaOH volume added. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the 25% is by volume of NaOH added to the total solution. Let me consider that.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the 25% titration refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So if the equivalence requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, then 25% would be 2.5 cm³ added.

So let's recalculate the pH at 25% titration based on that.

So, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Which is 25% of the 0.001 mol needed for equivalence.

So same as before: 0.00025 mol NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol acetic acid to produce 0.00025 mol acetate.

The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333, same as before.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 -0.477 = 4.253 → pH ≈4.25.

So same result as before.

Hmm. So the equivalence point pH is about 9.02, but no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution at equivalence. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but maybe some other salt? No, because NaOH is a strong base and acetic acid is weak, so it would form sodium acetate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact expression without approximations.

For the equivalence point:

The solution is 0.02 M acetate. So the reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02, since x is very small.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.983 → pH ≈9.017.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't at equivalence but at another point. Alternatively, perhaps the initial dilution is miscalculated.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * (20e-3 L) = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted with 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That part seems correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that at equivalence, it's not just acetate but the solution is more dilute, but that can't be. No, the calculation seems right.

Wait, but looking at the options, the equivalence pH for option D is 6.92, which is acidic, which doesn't make sense because sodium acetate should give a basic solution. So perhaps I'm wrong in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but something else. Wait, no, because NaOH is a strong base, and acetic acid is weak, so the neutralization produces acetate and water.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the equivalence point isn't when all the acetic acid is neutralized but when the moles are equal. Oh wait, that's correct. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence involves the autoionization of water or some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, but I thought that was the same as 25% of the moles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the pH at 25% of the NaOH volume added, not 25% of the moles. So let's try that.

At equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is needed. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, how much has reacted?

Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Which reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So same as before. So same pH as before, 4.25.

So that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial dilution is calculated incorrectly. Let me recheck.

Dilution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Concentration after dilution: (20 cm³) * 0.05 M = 1 mmol? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol, correct.

So when diluted to 40 cm³, 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. At equivalence, 6.92 is acidic. That can't be right because sodium acetate is a base, so pH should be above 7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach to equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but the solution is a buffer. No, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact equation without approximation.

Wait, Kb =5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

Let me write the expression again:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5 M.

pOH = 4.983 → pH=9.017.

Hmm, still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that we're using a 0.1 M NaOH solution, and perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, no. 0.1 M NaOH for 10 cm³ is 0.001 mol.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution is being considered for the equivalence point, but maybe the initial concentration is calculated incorrectly.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted to 40 cm³: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence pH.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the concentration in the original solution before adding NaOH, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the Ka and not approximate pKa.

Wait, let me compute the pH more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is a sodium acetate solution, but the pH is calculated incorrectly. Let me recompute.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.983 → pH=9.017.

So no, I don't see a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is more concentrated, but the volume is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem asks for the pH at 25% of the initial solution's volume, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the half-equivalence point, but that's when half the acetic acid is neutralized, which would be 50% titration, not 25%.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

The only option where the equivalence pH is close to my calculation is none, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Or perhaps the question is about something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when we dilute the acetic acid, the pH changes, and the titration starts from that pH. So the initial pH after dilution is different, and perhaps the titration calculations take that into account.

Wait, let me compute the initial pH after dilution.

The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

The pH can be calculated using the formula for weak acids:

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA]

Assuming x is the [H+]:

Ka = x²/(0.025 - x) ≈ x²/(0.025) → x = sqrt( Ka * 0.025 )

Ka is 1.85e-5.

So x = sqrt(1.85e-5 * 0.025 ) = sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 0.00068 M.

pH = -log(0.00068) ≈ 3.17.

Hmm, which is one of the options. Option B starts with 3.17. But the question is about the pH during titration, not the initial pH. So that's probably not relevant.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The options are for the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

My calculation for 25% titration is about 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is way below what I calculated.

So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in a different way. Let me think.

Wait, 25% titration: perhaps the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.

So that's correct.

At equivalence, the pH is about 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck.

Wait, initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the equivalence point is when the solution is half-neutralized, but that would be the half-equivalence point. No, the equivalence is when all is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps during the titration, the solution is heated, but the problem states 25°C, so that shouldn't affect it.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the exact concentration without considering that the volumes are additive. But that's a minor effect and shouldn't change the result dramatically.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me recalculate:

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate.

But wait, acetate is a weak base. So let's calculate the pH.

Using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = 4.98 → pH=9.02.

Still no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not at room temperature, but the problem states 25°C, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the NaOH is 0.1 M, but the volume is in liters. Wait, no: 25 cm³ is 0.025 L, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial dilution is incorrect.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is that when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is halved, so 0.025 M. So the initial pH is around 3.17, as I calculated earlier.

But during titration, when 25% is added, the pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps the problem is that the equivalence point is actually when NaOH is added beyond the equivalence point. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is actually a buffer. Wait, no, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the pH using exact values without any approximations. Let me try that.

For equivalence point:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Set up the equation:

x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

No change.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the pH at equivalence point when a weak acid is titrated with a strong base, which can also be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. pKa + pKb =14, so (pKa + pKb)/2 =7. So pH=7 is incorrect. At equivalence, the solution is basic, so pH>7.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] ) → but wait, that's the Henderson equation.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is converted to base, so [base]/[acid] is infinity, which would give pH = pKa + log(inf) → pKa + something large, which would be near 14, which isn't the case.

Wait, but that's not applicable here. Because when all the acid is neutralized, the solution is just the conjugate base.

So I think my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution after dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let me compute it again.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M → 0.05 *0.02 L=0.001 mol.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 /0.04 L=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the initial concentration before any dilution or titration, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 25% titration refers to 25% of the solution's volume, not of the moles. Let me think.

But that's the same as 25% of the moles, because the concentration is the same across the solution. So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option D has pH 4.57 at 25% and 6.92 at equivalence. But 6.92 is below 7, which can't be correct as the equivalence point should be basic.

Option A: 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. 8.52 is close to my calculated 9.02 but still a bit lower. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the equivalence pH more accurately.

Let me compute the exact pH without assuming x is negligible.

Equation: x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 M.

[OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983 → pH=9.017.

Hmm. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck the initial dilution.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → moles =0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I'll look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution has a pH that's different from what I calculated, and that's affecting the titration calculations. But for the titration, the relevant point is the moles, not the initial pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at 25% titration isn't a buffer. Let me think.

No, because at 25% titration, part of the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate, so it's a buffer.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to see if any option's equivalence pH is close to my calculation.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I'm wrong about the approach.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point is when the NaOH is in excess. No, because equivalence is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the initial concentration before any dilution, which would be 0.05 M. But that would change everything.

Wait, if the initial solution is 0.05 M and 20 cm³, then after adding 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.025 M, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of Ka instead of pKa.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.73.

At 25% titration, [A^-]/[HA] =1/3.

So pH=4.73 + log(1/3) =4.73 -0.477=4.253.

So pH≈4.25, which matches option A's first value.

At equivalence, the pH is about 9.02, but no option matches. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, which has 4.57, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the initial pH after dilution as part of the calculation.

Wait, the initial pH after dilution is about 3.17, as I calculated earlier. But that's before any titration.

Hmm. I'm really confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach for the equivalence point. Maybe the solution is a buffer of acetate and acetic acid, but that's not the case. At equivalence, all the acid is converted to acetate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but some other factor like activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, Ka =1.85e-5 → Kw=1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the equivalence point pH is around 8.52 as in option A, and see if that makes sense.

If pH is 8.52, then pOH=5.48 → [OH-]=2.69e-6 M.

Then, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) → 2.69e-6 = sqrt(5.405e-10 * C ).

Square both sides: (2.69e-6)^2 =5.405e-10 * C → 7.23e-12 =5.405e-10 * C → C=7.23e-12 /5.405e-10 → C≈0.0134 M.

But earlier, the concentration was 0.02 M, which would give a higher pH. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute what concentration would give pH 8.52.

pH=8.52 → pOH=5.48 → [OH-]=2.69e-6 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] = (2.69e-6)^2 / (0.02 - 2.69e-6) ≈ (7.23e-12)/(0.02) → 3.615e-10.

But the actual Kb is 5.405e-10. So that's lower than calculated, which suggests that the concentration is higher than 0.02 M.

Hmm. So to get [OH-] =2.69e-6, we need a higher concentration than 0.02 M, which isn't the case here. So this can't be correct.

Hmm. So I'm back to the conclusion that the equivalence pH should be around 9.02, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option A (4.26;8.52), but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but some other factor. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M acetate but a different concentration. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³ (40+10), so 0.05 L. 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I'll look for another approach. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the pH calculated using the same approach as the half-equivalence point.

Wait, at the half-equivalence point, pH=pKa=4.73. That's in option C and D.

But the question is about 25% and equivalence, not half.

Hmm. So I think the correct pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is around 9.02. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the initial acetic acid concentration before dilution, which is 0.05 M, not 0.025 M. Let me try that.

If initial concentration is 0.05 M and volume 20 cm³, moles=0.001. After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume 40 cm³, concentration 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. So same as before.

Hmm. I don't think that's the issue.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution after dilution is titrated, and the initial pH is lower, but that doesn't affect the titration's pH calculations.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time. I'll go with the calculations I did. The pH at 25% is about 4.26, and equivalence is about 9.02, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which has 4.26 and 8.52. But I'm not sure why the equivalence would be 8.52.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence calculation. Maybe I should re-calculate Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Let x be [OH^-].

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 M.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. So I don't see another way. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.

But looking at the options, the only one that matches the 25% titration pH is option A (4.26) and D (4.57). But my calculation says 4.26, so perhaps option A is the intended answer, even though the equivalence pH doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at 25% of the solution's volume, not 25% of the moles. Let me try that.

Wait, 25% of the solution's volume would be 10 cm³ added, but that's the same as 25% of the moles, as earlier.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, I think the correct pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 9.02. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option A: 4.26 and 8.52. But I'm not sure why the equivalence pH would be 8.52. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not just acetate, but perhaps some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate the Kb.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll conclude that option A is the intended answer, even though the equivalence pH doesn't seem right.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, resulting in a concentration of 0.025 M.

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. This means 25% of the moles of acetic acid (0.00025 mol) have been converted to acetate ions, leaving 75% of the acetic acid (0.00075 mol) unreacted. The total volume of the solution is now 42.5 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added). The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is now 50 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 10 cm³ of NaOH added). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water, and its hydrolysis can be analyzed using the \(K_b\) value:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b\) and \([\text{A}^-]\):

\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this calculated pH. The closest option for the equivalence point is **8.52** in option A, though this value is inconsistent with the calculations.

---

### Final Answer
Based on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, which matches option A. While the equivalence point calculation predicts a pH of approximately 9.02, the closest option provided is **8.52**. Therefore, the intended answer appears to be:

**Answer: A**
