Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. The given state is (3i, 4), and I need to compute this expectation value. Hmm, let's see.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, for S_y, which is the spin in the y-direction, the expectation value would be <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Wait, but what's the operator S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operators are given by S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So for S_y, the operator would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli y-matrix.

The Pauli y-matrix σ_y is:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The state given is (3i, 4). Let me write that as a column vector. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

Now, the expectation value <S_y> is ψ† S_y ψ. Wait, no, wait. I think the correct formula is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ>. So yes, that's the correct approach.

But let me make sure I get the order right. So, I need to compute ψ† multiplied by each component.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], right? Because the conjugate transpose of a column vector is a row vector with the conjugates.

So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ], because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real.

So now, I'll compute ψ† σ_y ψ, and then multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, let me write it all out step by step.

First, let's compute ψ† times σ_y.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply ψ† (which is [ -3, 4 ]) by σ_y, I get:

[ (-3)(0) + (4)(i) , (-3)(-i) + (4)(0) ] ?

Wait, wait, no, matrix multiplication is done as rows times columns. So when I multiply a 1x2 matrix (ψ†) by a 2x2 matrix (σ_y), the result is a 1x2 matrix.

Let me compute each element:

First element: (-3)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Multiplying by the first column of σ_y:

First element: (-3)*0 +4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3)*(-i) +4*0 = 3i +0 =3i.

Wait, no, wait, I think I mixed up the columns. Let me clarify.

Wait, when you multiply a row vector (1x2) with a matrix (2x2), each element of the resulting row vector (1x2) is the sum of products of the row elements with the respective column elements.

So for the first element of the resulting row vector, it's ψ† times first column of σ_y.

σ_y columns are [0, i] for the first column (since σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]), wait no, wait, no, the columns of σ_y are:

Column 1: [0, i],
Column 2: [-i, 0].

Wait, no, wait. Let me write σ_y as a matrix:

σ_y = [
[0, -i],
[i, 0]
]

So the first column is [0, i], and the second column is [-i, 0].

So when I multiply ψ† [a, b] by σ_y, I get:

a * [0, i] + b * [-i, 0].

Wait, no, no. Wait, matrix multiplication is rows × columns. So ψ† is [a b], σ_y is 2x2. The product ψ† σ_y is [a b] multiplied by each column of σ_y.

So the first element is a*0 + b*i, and the second is a*(-i) + b*0.

Wait, no, no, no. Wait, when you multiply a row vector by a matrix, each element of the resulting row is the dot product of the row with each column of the matrix.

Wait, for example, the first element of the product is (a)(0) + (b)(i) = 0 + bi.

Wait, no, because the first column of σ_y is the first column, which is [0; i]. So when you multiply [a b] by σ_y, the first element is a*0 + b*i = bi.

The second element is a*(-i) + b*0 = -a i.

So, ψ† σ_y is [bi, -a i], where a= -3, b=4.

So substituting a=-3, b=4, we have:

bi =4i, and -a i = 3i.

So, ψ† σ_y is [4i, 3i].

Wait, no, let me recheck. a is -3, so:

First element: 4 * i =4i.

Second element: (-3) * (-i) = 3i. Wait, no, wait, no. Let me correct.

Wait, the matrix multiplication step: ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Multiplying by σ_y's columns:

First element: (-3)*0 +4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3)*(-i) +4*0 = 3i +0=3i.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i,3i].

Now, the next step is to multiply this row vector by ψ.

Wait, ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So when we multiply [4i,3i] by ψ, which is a column vector, the result is a scalar.

So:

4i * 3i + 3i *4.

Let me compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

3i *4=12i.

So sum is (-12) +12i= (-12 +12i).

Wait, that can't be right because the expectation value should be a real number, right? Because spin operators have real expectation values. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's go back step by step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ψ† σ_y multiplied by ψ. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, ψ† σ_y is [4i,3i], and ψ is [3i,4].

So the product is (4i)*(3i) + (3i)*(4) = (12 i²) + (12 i).

i squared is -1, so 12*(-1)= -12. So the first term is -12. The second term is 12i.

So adding them gives (-12) + 12i.

Wait, but that's a complex number. But expectation values are supposed to be real. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the expectation value calculation should yield a real number, so perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Wait, let me double-check the multiplication steps.

Wait, ψ is [3i; 4]. So when I compute ψ† σ_y ψ, perhaps I should compute (ψ† σ_y) ψ, but perhaps it's better to compute σ_y ψ first, then take ψ† times that.

Let me try that approach.

Compute σ_y ψ first.

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so when you multiply σ_y by ψ, which is [3i;4], you get:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) +0*(4) = i*(3i) =3i²=3*(-1)= -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So ψ† (σ_y ψ) is (-3)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i -12.

Wait, that's 12i -12, which is the same as -12 +12i. So again, the same result.

Hmm, but that's a complex number. That can't be right for an expectation value. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the order of multiplication. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, and S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, maybe I should compute ψ† S_y ψ, which would be (ħ/2) ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, but in my calculation, ψ† σ_y ψ is (-12 + 12i), but that can't be correct because expectation values are real for Hermitian operators. S_y is Hermitian because σ_y is Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate ψ† σ_y ψ.

Alternative approach: compute ψ† σ_y ψ directly, without breaking it into steps.

So ψ is [3i,4]^T.

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]].

So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is:

( [ -3, 4 ] ) * ( σ_y ) * ( [3i;4] )

Compute it as:

[ -3,4 ] multiplied by (σ_y ψ).

Compute σ_y ψ first.

σ_y ψ = [ 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4), i*(3i) + 0*(4) ]^T.

Which is [ -4i, (i*3i) ]^T.

i*3i is 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, ψ† times σ_y ψ is [ -3,4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So:

(-3)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) = 12i -12.

So the result is (12i -12).

Wait, this is a complex number. But the expectation value should be real. So where did I go wrong?

Oh! Wait a minute. I think I messed up the order of multiplication. The spin state is a column vector, and the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, which would be a scalar.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the conjugate correctly. Let me recheck.

Wait, the state ψ is [3i,4]^T. So ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3, 4 ].

Wait, that's correct. 3i's complex conjugate is -3i? No, wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. Its complex conjugate is -3i.

Wait, no, wait: (3i)* = -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ]? No, wait, no.

Wait, no, wait: ψ is [3i,4]. So ψ† is [3i* ,4* ].

3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i because (3i) = 3 e^{i π/2}, so the conjugate is 3 e^{-i π/2} = -3i.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, okay, so in my earlier calculation, I think I made a mistake in ψ†. I thought ψ† was [ -3,4 ], but that's wrong because 3i* is -3i, not -3. So ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

Ah, that's the mistake! So I was using ψ† as [ -3,4 ], but it should be [ -3i,4 ].

Let me redo the calculation with the correct ψ†.

So ψ is [3i,4]^T.

ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

Now, compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

First, compute σ_y ψ.

σ_y times ψ is:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) +0*4 = i*3i = 3i² = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, multiply ψ† (which is [ -3i,4 ]) by σ_y ψ ([ -4i, -3 ]).

So:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So adding them together: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times this.

Wait, because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ )/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is -12 ħ /25.

Wait, none of the options have -12 ħ. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere else. Let me re-express the calculation again.

Wait, let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ correctly.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]].

ψ is [3i,4]^T.

So ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

So ψ† multiplied by σ_y gives:

[ (-3i)*0 +4*i , (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 ]

Wait, no, wait, when you multiply ψ† (1x2) by σ_y (2x2), you get another 1x2 vector.

The first element is the dot product of ψ† with the first column of σ_y.

First column of σ_y is [0, i]^T.

So element 1: (-3i)*0 +4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Element 2: ψ† dotted with second column of σ_y, which is [-i, 0]^T.

So element 2: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = 3i² +0 =3*(-1) =-3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by ψ, which is [3i,4]^T.

So:

(4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4).

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i² = -12.

-3 *4= -12.

So total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options, none of them have -12 ħ. The options are:

A) -12 ħ/25

B) 12 ħ/25

C) 25 ħ/2

D) -25 ħ/2

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the state vector.

Wait, the state is given as (3i,4). I assumed it was a column vector, but perhaps it's a row vector. Let me think.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, kets are column vectors. So (3i,4) is a column vector. So ψ is [3i;4].

So ψ† is [3i*,4*] = [ -3i,4 ].

Wait, but perhaps normalization is needed. Because in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized, but perhaps the given state isn't normalized.

Wait, let's compute the norm of ψ: |3i|^2 +|4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized; it's a vector of length 5. So perhaps I need to normalize it first.

Wait, but is that necessary for the expectation value? Because expectation values are linear, so the expectation value is [ψ† S_y ψ ] divided by [ψ† ψ], but wait, no, the expectation value is [ψ† S_y ψ ].

Wait, no, wait. If the state isn't normalized, then the expectation value would be [ψ† S_y ψ ] divided by [ψ† ψ ].

Because the expectation value is ⟨ A ⟩ = (ψ† A ψ ) / (ψ† ψ ), when ψ isn't normalized.

Wait, but in the question, the state is given as (3i,4), which is a vector of length 5, as above.

So, perhaps I should compute (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ).

So, ψ† ψ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16=25. So the norm is 25.

So, the expectation value is (⟨S_y⟩) = (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ).

Wait, so earlier I computed ψ† S_y ψ as (-24 ħ )?

Wait, no, earlier I computed ψ† σ_y ψ as -24, so ψ† S_y ψ is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

So the expectation value would be (-12 ħ) divided by 25, because ψ† ψ is 25.

So, ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 ħ) /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for the given state \( \psi = (3i, 4)^T \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Its conjugate transpose is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi.
   \]

4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Inner Product**: Compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Breaking this into components:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

6. **Expectation Value**: Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot (-24) = -12\hbar.
   \]

7. **Normalization**: The state \( \psi \) is not normalized. Its norm is:
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Therefore, the normalized expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

8. **Final Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
   \]
