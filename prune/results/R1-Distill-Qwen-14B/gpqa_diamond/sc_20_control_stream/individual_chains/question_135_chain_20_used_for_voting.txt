Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X, and I need to figure out which particles it can decay into based on the given Lagrangian and the mass of X.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Oh wait, maybe the notation is a bit off. Let me think. In the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions, giving them mass. The general form is something like L = - (m_f / v) ψ_f ψ_f (v + H), where H is the Higgs field. Oh, right, so maybe this Lagrangian is similar, implying that the boson X is analogous to the Higgs.

So, the boson X would couple to all the fermions that are present in this Lagrangian. So, the fermions ψ_f would get their masses from this interaction. The problem says that the mass of X is 6 GeV. Wait, the Higgs is around 125 GeV, so X is lighter. That might affect what it can decay into because the decay products have to sum to less than the mass of X, considering relativistic kinematics.

Wait, but I should clarify: when a particle decays, the total energy of the decay products (including their rest masses) must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, for X to decay into a pair of particles, say, two fermions f and f-bar, each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass. Because each fermion (and their antiparticle) would need to have energy at least equal to their rest mass. Since X is at rest when decaying, the maximum each can have is m_X/2. So, the mass of each fermion should be less than m_X/2.

Wait, but wait: the actual condition is that the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of X. But for a boson like X that decays into a fermion-antifermion pair (like X → f f̄), the sum is 2m_f. So, 2m_f < m_X → m_f < m_X/2.

So, for X to decay into f f̄, m_f must be less than 3 GeV, because m_X is 6 GeV. So m_X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but let me think again: The mass of the fermion must be less than m_X/2 because in the rest frame of X, each fermion gets at least their rest mass energy. So the maximum each can have is m_X/2, so their mass has to be less than that.

So, let's list all the known fermions and their masses.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV (so like 3 MeV)
- Down (d): ~0.004 GeV (about 4 MeV)
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV (95 MeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (but that's way heavier)

So X is 6 GeV, so m_X/2 is 3 GeV.

Which fermions have m_f < 3 GeV?

Looking at the quarks:

u: 3 MeV < 3 GeV → yes
d: 4 MeV → yes
s: 95 MeV → yes
c: ~1.275 GeV → yes (since 1.275 < 3)
b: ~4.13 GeV → no (4.13 > 3)
t: way too heavy.

Leptons:

e: yes
μ: 0.105 GeV → yes
τ: 1.777 GeV → yes

So the fermions that can be decay products are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the top quark? No, because m_t is way above 3 GeV.

So, the allowed decay channels are X → f f̄, where f is any of e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by the Lagrangian. So, the fermions that have a coupling to X are the ones that appear in the Lagrangian. Oh, right, because in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to all fermions except neutrinos (assuming they're massless, but in reality, they have masses too, but the coupling is via the Higgs for Dirac neutrinos). But in the given Lagrangian, which fermions does X couple to?

The problem says the interaction is given by L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the notation is that ψ_f(y) is the fermion field, and λ_f is the coupling. So all the fermions that are present in the Lagrangian, which would be all the fermions that have mass terms, i.e., all except neutrinos if they're massless.

But wait, the question doesn't specify which fermions are present in the theory. Hmm. So perhaps all the fermions have couplings to X, which would mean that any fermion lighter than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

So the possible decay channels would be:

e+ e-
μ+ μ-
τ+ τ-
u ū
d d̄
s s̄
c c̄

Wait, but let's check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−

But wait, the bottom quark mass is 4.13 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄ because 2m_b = 8.26 GeV, which is way more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

Wait, the c quark mass is about 1.275 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed. So option B includes c c̄ and excludes b, which is correct. The other fermions in B are all under 3 GeV, except perhaps muon and tau: tau is 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau pair is allowed. So option B includes all allowed fermions except t and b. But wait, the problem says X is a boson with mass 6 GeV, so the possible decay products are the fermion pairs as I listed earlier.

So looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but also t. But top quark is way too heavy, so X can't decay into t t̄. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

But again, b is too heavy, so D is wrong.

Wait, but wait: option B includes c c̄, which is allowed. Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back, option B is:

X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

Which includes all the allowed fermions except the bottom and top.

But let me double-check the quark masses:

c: about 1.3 GeV → allowed.

s: ~100 MeV → allowed.

u, d: very light → allowed.

So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given Lagrangian and the Standard Model-like interactions. The boson \( X \) couples to fermions, and its decays are governed by the condition that the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of \( X \). For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f < m_X \), or equivalently, \( m_f < m_X/2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The known fermion masses are:

- **Leptons**:  
  - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)  

- **Quarks**:  
  - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)  

From these, the fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the kinematically allowed decay channels are:

\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( m_b = 4.13 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \).  
2. **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed.  
3. **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \).  
4. **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
