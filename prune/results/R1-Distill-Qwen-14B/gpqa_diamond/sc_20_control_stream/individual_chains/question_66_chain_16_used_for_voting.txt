Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, right? So all the operators must be Lorentz scalars because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, Poincare symmetry is about the full symmetry of Minkowski space, which includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they have to respect local Lorentz symmetry. Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's valid up to some cutoff. But do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think that the Poincare symmetry would imply that the theory is translationally invariant. However, in SMEFT, the interactions are treated perturbatively, and the operators are local, so I think they have to respect Poincare symmetry as well. But wait, wait. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it's not part of SMEFT. So option 2, Poincare, must be respected.

But wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, then yes, each operator must be a Poincare scalar, which they are because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory and the theory is translationally invariant.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincare includes translations. Are the operators themselves required to be invariant under translations? Or is the entire theory translationally invariant, but the individual operators don't need to be translationally symmetric on their own.

Hmm, thinking about this. Each operator is a local operator, and the theory is built such that when you translate the coordinates, the overall action is invariant. So the operators don't have to be translationally invariant on their own because the translation affects all terms, but the sum remains invariant. So individual operators may not be translationally invariant, but the entire action is. So when the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators, maybe translation symmetry isn't a requirement for each operator, but rather for the theory as a whole. So perhaps Poincare symmetry (option 2) isn't necessarily something each operator must individually respect; the theory as a whole respects it, but individual operators might not be invariant under translations.

Wait, but the operators are part of the Lagrangian. For the Lagrangian to be translationally invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar and have the correct dimensions. Because otherwise, when you translate, the terms would change. So each operator in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. So that includes Lorentz symmetry, and if the term is part of a translationally-invariant Lagrangian, then each operator must also be a scalar under translations. Wait, but scalar under translations? Hmm, not exactly. For a Lagrangian to be translationally invariant, the sum of the terms must be invariant. Each term doesn't need to be a scalar under translations, but when you integrate them over spacetime, the total must be. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must transform as Lorentz scalars, meaning they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is a must. As for Poincare, which includes translations, perhaps the individual operators don't need to be invariant under translations because the theory as a whole is, but the operators themselves don't have to individually respect translation symmetry. So in the question, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1 yes), Poincare (2, no, because operators don't have to each be invariant under translations; the theory does).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be invariant under these symmetries.

So, for Lorentz symmetry (1), yes. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar because the theory is Lorentz-invariant.

Poincare symmetry (2) includes translations. But each operator doesn't need to be invariant under translations. For example, the term (partial_mu) (field) would change under translation, but when you sum all terms in the Lagrangian, the total is invariant. So perhaps the individual operator doesn't have to be translationally invariant. So the operator must respect Lorentz symmetry but may not need to respect translation symmetry. So Poincare symmetry (2) is not necessarily respected by each operator.

So that would mean that option 2 is not a required symmetry for each operator. So the correct answer would not include 2.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The question is whether all SMEFT operators must respect these.

Wait, in the Standard Model, CP symmetry is an approximate symmetry. In SMEFT, operators are added that can violate CP. For example, operators like (H^\dagger H)^2 are CP-even, but operators like (H i γ5 H) could be CP-odd. So if the SM is extended with operators that can break CP, then the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry. Hence, CP symmetry (3) isn't necessarily respected by all operators. But wait, the question is, must they? Or can they violate it?

Wait, the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the SMEFT operators can't necessarily violate any symmetry that's a fundamental symmetry of the theory. Or, perhaps, the operators must be invariant under certain symmetries.

Wait, actually, SMEFT is a theory that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators. So the operators can break any symmetry that is not a part of the underlying symmetries. For example, the SM has certain gauge symmetries (like SU(2), U(1)), but SMEFT operators can break these, but only the gauge symmetry is explicitly broken, but other symmetries like CP may or may not be respected.

Wait, but in reality, the SMEFT operators can have any possible Lorentz-invariant structure, so they can violate various symmetries, including CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

Then, what about CPT symmetry? CPT is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories, including the SM. So in SMEFT, the theory must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, all operators must be CPT-symmetric. Because if the theory isn't CPT invariant, it would lead to observable violations, such as non-unitary S-matrix, which are not observed. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So to recap:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Yes, operators must be Lorentz scalars.
2. Poincare symmetry: No, the operators don't need to be invariant under translations, just the theory as a whole.
3. CP symmetry: No, operators can violate CP.
4. CPT symmetry: Yes, all operators must respect CPT.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 and 4.

Wait, let me check: the options are:

1. Lorentz symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

Which of these must be respected by all operators.

So the correct ones are 1 and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 — that includes 2 which is Poincare, which I don't think applies to individual operators.

Option D is 1,3,4 — which includes CP, which isn't required.

Option A is 1 and 2 — which includes Poincare, which I don't think applies.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because Lorentz is part of Poincare, so if the operators respect Lorentz, they don't necessarily have to respect translations, but the theory as a whole must respect Poincare. So the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare. So the correct symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz and CPT.

So the question is, which of the options have 1 and 4. Let's see the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → includes 2 which I think is no.

Option D: 1,3,4 → includes 3 (CP) which isn't required.

Hmm, none of the options have 1 and 4. Wait, let's double-check.

Wait, the options for the question are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry

2. Poincare symmetry

3. CP symmetry

4. CPT symmetry

The options are A to D:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So none of the options have only 1 and 4. Hmm, so perhaps I was wrong in my assessment, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is built in a way that the Lagrangian is a scalar. But wait, no — the operators are part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must be a scalar density, so each term must be a scalar. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar. Because under translation, the spacetime derivative terms can change, but the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. So the individual terms don't have to be translationally invariant, only their sum does.

Therefore, Poincare symmetry is a global symmetry that the theory as a whole must respect, but the individual operators don't need to be invariant under translations. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4), but not necessarily Poincare (2) or CP (3).

So then, the correct symmetries are 1 and 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them include 1 and 4 only. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding Poincare. Because Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. So if the theory is Poincare-invariant, then the operators must be such that the sum of their terms is invariant. But individual operators don't have to be translationally invariant. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) but not Poincare (2). So the correct answer would include 1 and 4, but that's only 1 and 4. Since none of the options have that, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied if the theory is built with Lorentz-invariant operators and the Lagrangian is a scalar. So in that case, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, no, because the individual operators can be non-scalar under translations, but the sum in the Lagrangian is a scalar. For example, the kinetic term ∂μ ϕ ∂^μ ϕ is invariant under translations, but a term like ϕ ∂μ ϕ would not be a scalar under translations. Wait, no, ϕ ∂μ ϕ is a scalar under Lorentz, but under translations, it's not. Because if you shift x → x + a, then ∂μ becomes ∂μ, but the ϕ would have a term from the derivative. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density. So each operator must be a scalar under both Lorentz and translations. Because if a term in the Lagrangian is not a scalar, then the entire Lagrangian wouldn't be a scalar, and the theory wouldn't be translationally invariant.

Wait, that can't be right because terms like (∂μ ϕ)^2 are scalars, but terms like (∂μ ϕ)(∂ν ϕ) would have to be combined into a scalar, which is (∂μ ϕ)^2 summed over μ.

Wait, perhaps the point is that each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and since the Lagrangian is a scalar density, each term must be a Lorentz scalar. But to form a scalar density, the terms must be Lorentz scalars multiplied by the appropriate number of derivatives or fields.

But about translation invariance: the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which is invariant under translations. So each term in the Lagrangian must transform as a scalar density under translations. But scalar under translations just means that the term is a function of the fields and their derivatives, but not involving x. So each operator in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under translations.

Wait, but how? Because any term in the Lagrangian that is a function of x would not be a scalar under translations. Therefore, all terms in the Lagrangian must be functions that are translationally invariant, which only depends on fields and their derivatives, not on x. Hence, the operators themselves must be scalars under translations, meaning that each operator must be a scalar under Poincare.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, all operators must be Lorentz scalars because the theory is Lorentz invariant. But since the theory is also Poincare invariant, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. Because the Lagrangian is a scalar density, each term must be a scalar under translations as well.

Wait, that would mean that each operator must be both a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So in that case, both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries are respected.

But wait, I think that's not correct because the operators can have terms that are not individually invariant under translations, but their sum in the Lagrangian is. For example, consider a term like ∂μ ϕ ∂^μ ϕ. Under a translation, this term remains the same because it's a function of the derivatives of ϕ, which are invariant under translations. But other terms might involve ϕ itself without derivatives, like ϕ^2. Under translations, ϕ is a field that depends on x, so ϕ(x) → ϕ(x + a). But the term ϕ^2 is invariant under translations. So each term in the Lagrangian is a scalar under translations.

Wait, but what about operators that are not scalars under translations? For instance, an operator like x_mu ∂^mu ϕ. Under translation, this would change because x_mu shifts. So such an operator would not be part of the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which is invariant under translations. Therefore, all operators in the Lagrangian must be scalars under translations as well as Lorentz transformations. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

If that's the case, then option 2 is also a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. I think I need to look for a more authoritative source.

In SMEFT, the operators are organized as Lorentz-invariant operators of increasing dimension. The theory must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, so gauge symmetries, Lorentz symmetry, and possibly others. But wait, the Standard Model's gauge symmetry is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but SMEFT operators can break these if they're not invariant under them. But that's not the question here.

The question is about which of the four symmetries (Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT) must all operators in SMEFT respect.

I think that in any quantum field theory, the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare symmetry (i.e., invariant under Lorentz and translation). So each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps Poincare is a global symmetry that the theory must have, which would imply that all operators in the Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare. So that would mean that operators 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about what each symmetry implies.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. But operators are part of a Lagrangian, which is a scalar density. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a scalar under translations.

Therefore, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry (2 yes).

So, to recap:

1. Lorentz symmetry: yes, because operators are Lorentz scalars.

2. Poincare symmetry: yes, because operators are part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

3. CP symmetry: no, operators can violate CP.

4. CPT symmetry: yes, because the theory must respect CPT.

Wait, but earlier I thought that operators don't have to respect CP, but they must respect CPT.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → yes.

So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, I thought earlier that Poincare symmetry isn't a requirement for each operator. But perhaps because the whole theory is Poincare-invariant, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So in that case, the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

So the correct answer would be option C (1,2,4).

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is a global symmetry that the entire theory must respect, but individual operators don't have to be Poincare scalars. But that doesn't make sense because the Lagrangian is built from local operators, which must combine into a Poincare scalar.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of a simple example. Take the term ∂μ ϕ ∂^μ ϕ. Under a translation, this term is invariant because the derivatives don't change in a way that affects the term. So this operator is invariant under translations. But what about a term like ϕ ∂μ ϕ? Under a translation, x → x + a, so ∂μ → ∂μ (since translation doesn't affect the derivative operator). So the term is ϕ(x) ∂μ ϕ(x). Under translation, this becomes ϕ(x+a) ∂μ ϕ(x+a). But ϕ(x+a) is ϕ evaluated at x+a. So the term itself would change if ϕ depends on x. Wait, no, because ϕ is a field that can depend on x, but the operator is ϕ multiplied by the derivative of ϕ. So under translation, the entire operator would shift, but that would change the term. So such a term would not be invariant under translations, so it can't be part of the Lagrangian. Therefore, all operators in the Lagrangian must be such that they are invariant under translations, which implies that each operator must be a scalar under translations. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Thus, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry (2), Lorentz (1), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry in the context of the theory:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators in SMEFT must transform as Lorentz scalars because the theory is formulated in a Lorentz-invariant framework. This ensures that the operators are consistent with the invariance of the action under Lorentz transformations.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. For the Lagrangian to be a scalar density, which is a requirement for the theory to be translationally invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. Since operators in SMEFT are part of the Lagrangian, they must also respect translation symmetry. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a fundamental symmetry of SMEFT. Operators in SMEFT can explicitly violate CP symmetry, as the theory allows for such terms. Thus, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theory, including SMEFT. The theory must respect CPT symmetry to ensure unitarity and the consistency of the S-matrix. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as operators in SMEFT can violate it.

### Correct Option:
C) 1, 2, 4

Answer: C

Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, right? So all the operators must be Lorentz scalars because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, Poincare symmetry is about the full symmetry of Minkowski space, which includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they have to respect local Lorentz symmetry. Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's valid up to some cutoff. But do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think that the Poincare symmetry would imply that the theory is translationally invariant. However, in SMEFT, the interactions are treated perturbatively, and the operators are local, so I think they have to respect Poincare symmetry as well. But wait, wait. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it's not part of SMEFT. So option 2, Poincare, must be respected.

But wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, then yes, each operator must be a Poincare scalar, which they are because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory and the theory is translationally invariant.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincare includes translations. Are the operators themselves required to be invariant under translations? Or is the entire theory translationally invariant, but the individual operators don't need to be translationally symmetric on their own.

Hmm, thinking about this. Each operator is a local operator, and the theory is built such that when you translate the coordinates, the overall action is invariant. So the operators don't have to be translationally invariant on their own because the translation affects all terms, but the sum remains invariant. So individual operators may not be translationally invariant, but the entire action is. So when the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators, maybe translation symmetry isn't a requirement for each operator, but rather for the theory as a whole. So perhaps Poincare symmetry (option 2) isn't necessarily something each operator must individually respect; the theory as a whole respects it, but individual operators might not be invariant under translations.

Wait, but the operators are part of the Lagrangian. For the Lagrangian to be translationally invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar and have the correct dimensions. Because otherwise, when you translate, the terms would change. So each operator in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. So that includes Lorentz symmetry, and if the term is part of a translationally-invariant Lagrangian, then each operator must also be a scalar under translations. Wait, but scalar under translations? Hmm, not exactly. For a Lagrangian to be translationally invariant, the sum of the terms must be invariant. Each term doesn't need to be a scalar under translations, but when you integrate them over spacetime, the total must be. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must transform as Lorentz scalars, meaning they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is a must. As for Poincare, which includes translations, perhaps the individual operators don't need to be invariant under translations because the theory as a whole is, but the operators themselves don't have to individually respect translation symmetry. So in the question, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1 yes), Poincare (2, no, because operators don't have to each be invariant under translations; the theory does).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be invariant under these symmetries.

So, for Lorentz symmetry (1), yes. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar because the theory is Lorentz-invariant.

Poincare symmetry (2) includes translations. But each operator doesn't need to be invariant under translations. For example, the term (partial_mu) (field) would change under translation, but when you sum all terms in the Lagrangian, the total is invariant. So perhaps the individual operator doesn't have to be translationally invariant. So the operator must respect Lorentz symmetry but may not need to respect translation symmetry. So Poincare symmetry (2) is not necessarily respected by each operator.

So that would mean that option 2 is not a required symmetry for each operator. So the correct answer would not include 2.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The question is whether all SMEFT operators must respect these.

Wait, in the Standard Model, CP symmetry is an approximate symmetry. In SMEFT, operators are added that can violate CP. For example, operators like (H^\dagger H)^2 are CP-even, but operators like (H i γ5 H) could be CP-odd. So if the SM is extended with operators that can break CP, then the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry. Hence, CP symmetry (3) isn't necessarily respected by all operators. But wait, the question is, must they? Or can they violate it?

Wait, the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the SMEFT operators can't necessarily violate any symmetry that's a fundamental symmetry of the theory. Or, perhaps, the operators must be invariant under certain symmetries.

Wait, actually, SMEFT is a theory that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators. So the operators can break any symmetry that is not a part of the underlying symmetries. For example, the SM has certain gauge symmetries (like SU(2), U(1)), but SMEFT operators can break these, but only the gauge symmetry is explicitly broken, but other symmetries like CP may or may not be respected.

Wait, but in reality, the SMEFT operators can have any possible Lorentz-invariant structure, so they can violate various symmetries, including CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

Then, what about CPT symmetry? CPT is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories, including the SM. So in SMEFT, the theory must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, all operators must be CPT-symmetric. Because if the theory isn't CPT invariant, it would lead to observable violations, such as non-unitary S-matrix, which are not observed. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So to recap:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Yes, operators must be Lorentz scalars.
2. Poincare symmetry: No, the operators don't need to be invariant under translations, just the theory as a whole.
3. CP symmetry: No, operators can violate CP.
4. CPT symmetry: Yes, all operators must respect CPT.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 and 4.

Wait, let me check: the options are:

1. Lorentz symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

Which of these must be respected by all operators.

So the correct ones are 1 and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 — that includes 2 which is Poincare, which I don't think applies to individual operators.

Option D is 1,3,4 — which includes CP, which isn't required.

Option A is 1 and 2 — which includes Poincare, which I don't think applies.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because Lorentz is part of Poincare, so if the operators respect Lorentz, they don't necessarily have to respect translations, but the theory as a whole must respect Poincare. So the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare. So the correct symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz and CPT.

So the question is, which of the options have 1 and 4. Let's see the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → includes 2 which I think is no.

Option D: 1,3,4 → includes 3 (CP) which isn't required.

Hmm, none of the options have 1 and 4. Wait, let's double-check.

Wait, the options for the question are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry

2. Poincare symmetry

3. CP symmetry

4. CPT symmetry

The options are A to D:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So none of the options have only 1 and 4. Hmm, so perhaps I was wrong in my assessment, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is built in a way that the Lagrangian is a scalar. But wait, no — the operators are part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must be a scalar density, so each term must be a scalar. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar. Because under translation, the spacetime derivative terms can change, but the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. So the individual terms don't have to be translationally invariant, only their sum does.

Therefore, Poincare symmetry is a global symmetry that the theory as a whole must respect, but the individual operators don't need to be invariant under translations. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4), but not necessarily Poincare (2) or CP (3).

So then, the correct symmetries are 1 and 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them include 1 and 4 only. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake regarding Poincare. Because Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. So if the theory is Poincare-invariant, then the operators must be such that the sum of their terms is invariant. But individual operators don't have to be translationally invariant. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) but not Poincare (2). So the correct answer would include 1 and 4, but that's only 1 and 4. Since none of the options have that, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied if the theory is built with Lorentz-invariant operators and the Lagrangian is a scalar. So in that case, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, no, because the individual operators can be non-scalar under translations, but the sum in the Lagrangian is a scalar. For example, the kinetic term ∂μ ϕ ∂^μ ϕ is invariant under translations, but a term like ϕ ∂μ ϕ would not be a scalar under translations. Wait, no, ϕ ∂μ ϕ is a scalar under Lorentz, but under translations, it's not. Because if you shift x → x + a, then ∂μ becomes ∂μ, but the ϕ would have a term from the derivative. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar density. So each operator must be a scalar under both Lorentz and translations. Because if a term in the Lagrangian is not a scalar, then the entire Lagrangian wouldn't be a scalar, and the theory wouldn't be translationally invariant.

Wait, that can't be right because terms like (∂μ ϕ)^2 are scalars, but terms like (∂μ ϕ)(∂ν ϕ) would have to be combined into a scalar, which is (∂μ ϕ)^2 summed over μ.

Wait, perhaps the point is that each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and since the Lagrangian is a scalar density, each term must be a Lorentz scalar. But to form a scalar density, the terms must be Lorentz scalars multiplied by the appropriate number of derivatives or fields.

But about translation invariance: the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which is invariant under translations. So each term in the Lagrangian must transform as a scalar density under translations. But scalar under translations just means that the term is a function of the fields and their derivatives, but not involving x. So each operator in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under translations.

Wait, but how? Because any term in the Lagrangian that is a function of x would not be a scalar under translations. Therefore, all terms in the Lagrangian must be functions that are translationally invariant, which only depends on fields and their derivatives, not on x. Hence, the operators themselves must be scalars under translations, meaning that each operator must be a scalar under Poincare.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, all operators must be Lorentz scalars because the theory is Lorentz invariant. But since the theory is also Poincare invariant, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. Because the Lagrangian is a scalar density, each term must be a scalar under translations as well.

Wait, that would mean that each operator must be both a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So in that case, both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries are respected.

But wait, I think that's not correct because the operators can have terms that are not individually invariant under translations, but their sum in the Lagrangian is. For example, consider a term like ∂μ ϕ ∂^μ ϕ. Under a translation, this term remains the same because it's a function of the derivatives of ϕ, which are invariant under translations. But other terms might involve ϕ itself without derivatives, like ϕ^2. Under translations, ϕ is a field that depends on x, so ϕ(x) → ϕ(x + a). But the term ϕ^2 is invariant under translations. So each term in the Lagrangian is a scalar under translations.

Wait, but what about operators that are not scalars under translations? For instance, an operator like x_mu ∂^mu ϕ. Under translation, this would change because x_mu shifts. So such an operator would not be part of the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which is invariant under translations. Therefore, all operators in the Lagrangian must be scalars under translations as well as Lorentz transformations. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

If that's the case, then option 2 is also a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. I think I need to look for a more authoritative source.

In SMEFT, the operators are organized as Lorentz-invariant operators of increasing dimension. The theory must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, so gauge symmetries, Lorentz symmetry, and possibly others. But wait, the Standard Model's gauge symmetry is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but SMEFT operators can break these if they're not invariant under them. But that's not the question here.

The question is about which of the four symmetries (Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT) must all operators in SMEFT respect.

I think that in any quantum field theory, the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare symmetry (i.e., invariant under Lorentz and translation). So each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps Poincare is a global symmetry that the theory must have, which would imply that all operators in the Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare. So that would mean that operators 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about what each symmetry implies.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. But operators are part of a Lagrangian, which is a scalar density. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a scalar under translations.

Therefore, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry (2 yes).

So, to recap:

1. Lorentz symmetry: yes, because operators are Lorentz scalars.

2. Poincare symmetry: yes, because operators are part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

3. CP symmetry: no, operators can violate CP.

4. CPT symmetry: yes, because the theory must respect CPT.

Wait, but earlier I thought that operators don't have to respect CP, but they must respect CPT.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → yes.

So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, I thought earlier that Poincare symmetry isn't a requirement for each operator. But perhaps because the whole theory is Poincare-invariant, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So in that case, the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

So the correct answer would be option C (1,2,4).

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is a global symmetry that the entire theory must respect, but individual operators don't have to be Poincare scalars. But that doesn't make sense because the Lagrangian is built from local operators, which must combine into a Poincare scalar.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of a simple example. Take the term ∂μ ϕ ∂^μ ϕ. Under a translation, this term is invariant because the derivatives don't change in a way that affects the term. So this operator is invariant under translations. But what about a term like ϕ ∂μ ϕ? Under a translation, x → x + a, so ∂μ → ∂μ (since translation doesn't affect the derivative operator). So the term is ϕ(x) ∂μ ϕ(x). Under translation, this becomes ϕ(x+a) ∂μ ϕ(x+a). But ϕ(x+a) is ϕ evaluated at x+a. So the term itself would change if ϕ depends on x. Wait, no, because ϕ is a field that can depend on x, but the operator is ϕ multiplied by the derivative of ϕ. So under translation, the entire operator would shift, but that would change the term. So such a term would not be invariant under translations, so it can't be part of the Lagrangian. Therefore, all operators in the Lagrangian must be such that they are invariant under translations, which implies that each operator must be a scalar under translations. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Thus, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry (2), Lorentz (1), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry in the context of the theory:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators in SMEFT must transform as Lorentz scalars because the theory is formulated in a Lorentz-invariant framework. This ensures that the operators are consistent with the invariance of the action under Lorentz transformations.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. For the Lagrangian to be a scalar density, which is a requirement for the theory to be translationally invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. Since operators in SMEFT are part of the Lagrangian, they must also respect translation symmetry. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a fundamental symmetry of SMEFT. Operators in SMEFT can explicitly violate CP symmetry, as the theory allows for such terms. Thus, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theory, including SMEFT. The theory must respect CPT symmetry to ensure unitarity and the consistency of the S-matrix. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as operators in SMEFT can violate it.
