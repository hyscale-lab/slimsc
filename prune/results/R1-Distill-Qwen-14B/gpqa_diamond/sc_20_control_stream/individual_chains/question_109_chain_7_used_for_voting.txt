Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, okay, let me start by breaking down the problem.

The question says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

Wait, so T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. The equation T = S + L +1 mod 2. Okay, so the sum of S and L plus 1 must have the same parity as T. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So substituting, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That means S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Like if S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa. Because even + odd = odd, which is 1 mod 2.

Now, the problem asks which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are A to D, each showing the transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle. The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X: p, s, f, etc. Wait, what do those letters correspond to? Oh right, s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, f is 3. So in the options, the particle X has angular momentum l = 0 (s), 1 (p), or 2 (d), etc.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the particle X's angular momentum would affect the total angular momentum of the system. So when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum L of the NN system and the spin of X would combine with the NN's spin and orbital angular momentum of the emitted state.

Wait, maybe I should think about conservation laws. Both angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

So, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is 2S+1 L (J). So 1S0 implies 2S+1 =1, which means S=0. L is 0 (since it's denoted as S, so L=0), and J=0.

So initial state: S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emitting the particle X, the final NN state has T=0. From earlier, this implies that S' (spin) and L' (orbital) of the NN must be such that S' + L' =1 mod 2.

So for the final state, S' + L' must be odd.

Also, the total angular momentum J' must satisfy J' = L' + S', but I'm not sure if it's vector addition. Wait, J' is the total angular momentum, so it's the sum of the orbital angular momentum L' and the spin S' of the NN system. But wait, the spin is for the two nucleons; for a NN system, the possible total spin is S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). But in the initial state, S was 0. So in the final state, could S' be 0 or 1? Hmm.

But wait, the problem states that the NN system is in a state with T=0. Wait, T is isospin, which for two nucleons... Nucleons are protons and neutrons, but in the case of two protons or two neutrons, the isospin would be different. But in this problem, the particle X is emitted, so the NN system is the remaining part.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me reorient. The initial state is 1S0, which is a singlet state since 2S+1=1 implies S=0. Then, the NN emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the final state is NN in some state, and X is emitted.

Because of the emission, we have to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The parity of the initial state is (−1)^L. L=0, so parity is 1. The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because the process is NN → NN' + X. So, the parity of the initial (NN) is 1 (since L=0). The parity of the final NN state is (parity of NN') multiplied by the parity of X. So, parity conservation implies initial parity equals final parity.

Wait, the initial parity is 1 (since L=0). The final parity is (parity of NN') × (parity of X). So 1 = (parity of NN') × (-1) because X's parity is -1. Therefore, parity of NN' must be (parity of NN') = 1 / (-1) = -1.

Wait, no. Because parity is multiplicative. So initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = 1.

After emission: the parity is P_final = [parity of NN'] × [parity of X]. So, 1 = [parity of NN'] × (-1). Therefore, [parity of NN'] = 1 / (-1) = -1. So P_NN' is -1.

Parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. So, (-1)^L' = -1 → L' must be odd. So L' is an odd integer.

Wait, L' is the orbital angular momentum quantum number for the NN' state. So L' must be odd. So L' could be 1,3,5 etc. But in the options, the possible L's for the final NN state are given by the spectroscopic notation in the options.

Wait, the options are like 7D1, which is 7D1. So the term symbol is 7D1, meaning (2S'+1)L' J'.

Wait, let me think about each option.

The initial state is 1S0. So S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emission, the final NN state has some term, say, aSbL' J'.

But wait, the options give the final state as things like 7D1, 3S1, etc. So for each option, the final NN state's term is given, along with the particle emitted.

The emitted particle X has a certain orbital angular momentum state. For example, option D is 3P0 + s. So s is l=0. So X has angular momentum l=0.

Wait, but how does that affect the angular momentum conservation?

Let me think about the process. The initial state has total angular momentum J=0 (since it's 1S0). The final state will consist of the NN' state with angular momentum J' and the emitted particle X with angular momentum l (which is the orbital part, but the spin part might be involved as well).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to apply angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum (orbital) of the initial system is L=0. After emission, the NN' system has L' (orbital angular momentum), and X has angular momentum l (orbital). So the sum of L' and l must equal the initial L, which is zero? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Because in emission, it's more about the total angular momentum, which includes orbital and spin parts.

Alternatively, the total angular momentum before and after must be the same. But the initial state has J=0, so the final state's total J must also be zero. The final state is the NN' plus X. So their combined angular momenta must sum to zero.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the orbital angular momentum, considering that the spin of the emitted particle may complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, the initial state: J_initial = 0.

After emission, the system is NN' (with angular momentum J') and X (with angular momentum l). So the total J must be 0, so J' + l = J_initial? No, that's not right because angular momentum is a vector, and you have to add them vectorially. So the total J' (NN') plus X's angular momentum must add up to zero.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total angular momentum before and after.

Wait, the initial state has angular momentum J=0. The final state is the NN' state with J' and the X particle with j. So J' + j = 0 in a vector sense. Which implies that j must be equal and opposite to J'. But since angular momentum is quantized, this can only happen if J' = j and they are opposite in direction. So J' and j must have the same magnitude.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, since J_initial is zero, the total angular momentum after must also be zero, so J' (NN') + j (X) = 0. So J' must equal j in magnitude and opposite direction.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's better to think about the orbital angular momentum and spin separately, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the angular momentum quantum numbers and parity.

So, for each option, let's analyze the possible values.

Each option gives the final state of NN as a term, and the emitted particle's state (e.g., p, s, etc.). The lowercase letter represents the orbital angular momentum (l) of the emitted particle.

Let's process each option:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.
So, the emitted particle is p, which is l=1.

The final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse this term symbol. The term is (2S'+1)L' J'.

Wait, the term is 7D1. So 2S'+1 =7 → S'=3. The L' is D, which is l=2. J' is 1.

So for the final NN state, S'=3, L'=2, J'=1.

Now, from the condition T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, the isospin T for the final state is given as 0. So T' = 0.

But earlier we have T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2. So substituting, 0 = S' + L' +1 mod 2.

S' is 3, which is odd. L' is 2, which is even.

So S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. Then, 1 +1 =2 → 0 mod 2. So 0=0, which is okay. So this option satisfies the condition.

Now, check parity. The NN' state's parity is (-1)^L' = (-1)^2 = 1. But earlier, we found that the parity of the NN' state should be -1. So this would imply 1 × (-1) (from X) = -1, which matches the initial parity of 1. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in the initial state, the parity is 1. The final parity is (parity of NN') × (parity of X). X has parity -1. NN' has parity (-1)^L' = (-1)^2 =1. So 1 × (-1) = -1. But initial parity is 1, so this would not match. Because the initial state's parity is 1, the final must be 1. But according to this, the final is -1, so it's a violation. So this option is not allowed, but wait, did I get that right?

Wait no. Let me redo that. The parity conservation says that the initial parity must equal the final parity. The initial parity is 1. The final parity is the product of the NN' parity and the X parity.

But the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L' = (-1)^2 =1. The parity of X is given as -1. So final parity is 1 * (-1) = -1. But initial parity is 1. So this would not be conserved. So this transition is not allowed. So option A is not permitted. But wait, this is an option, but I need to check all options. Because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should also consider the orbital angular momentum of X. Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum between the NN' and X system would contribute to the total angular momentum. So perhaps the parity calculation also involves the orbital angular momentum of X. Hmm.

Wait, the emitted particle's intrinsic parity is given, but the overall parity also depends on the orbital angular momentum state. The parity of the emitted particle in the decay is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum between the emitting particle and the X.

Wait, wait. The overall parity of the emitted particle would be its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle in that decay. Because the parity operator includes the orbital part.

So, the parity of X in the decay is (-1)^(l) × (intrinsic parity of X). So for X, the parity is (-1)^l × (-1) = (-1)^(l+1).

So the final parity is (parity of NN') × (parity of X in decay) = (-1)^{L'} × (-1)^{l+1}.

This must equal the initial parity, which is (-1)^0 = 1.

So, 1 = (-1)^{L'} × (-1)^{l+1} → 1 = (-1)^{L' + l +1}.

Which implies that L' + l +1 must be even. Because (-1)^even =1.

So L' + l must be odd.

So for each option, L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state, and l is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Now, let's re-express the parity condition: L' + l must be odd.

So in each option, I need to check this.

Let me get back to each option.

Option A: NN' is 7D1. So L' is 2 (D is l=2). X is p, so l=1.

So L' + l = 2 + 1 =3 → odd. So parity condition is satisfied.

So option A is allowed.

Now, initial J=0. The final state's angular momentum must be zero. So the total angular momentum after emission is the sum of the NN' J' and X's j. But wait, J' is the total angular momentum of the NN', which is a combination of their orbital L' and spin S'. Similarly, X's j is a combination of its orbital l and spin s. But for this problem, perhaps we can consider that the orbital angular momentum and spin are coupled, and that the total J is zero.

Wait, this is getting complicated, perhaps another approach. The initial state has J=0. The final state's total J is the vector sum of the NN' J' and X's j. Since initial J is zero, the final total J must also be zero.

But perhaps I can ignore the spin part and focus on the orbital angular momentum, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the possible angular momentum states.

Wait, but since J_initial is zero, the total angular momentum after must also be zero. So J' (NN') and j (X) must add up to zero. So J' = j, but in opposite directions.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's sufficient to consider the possible values of L' and l such that their sum can contribute to J' and j being compatible.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity condition along with the Pauli condition is sufficient to eliminate the impossible options.

Let me proceed to each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

As before, L'=2, l=1. So L' + l = 3 → odd. So parity condition holds.

Now, the final NN' state has S' =3 (from 7D1: 2S' +1=7 → S'=3). L' =2.

So T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2 → 3 +2 +1 =6 → mod 2 is 0. So T'=0, which is correct.

So this option is allowed.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

The final NN' state is 3S1.

3S1 → 2S' +1 =3 → S' =1. L' is S, which is 0.

So L' =0.

So T'= S' + L' +1 mod 2 → 1 +0 +1=2 → mod 2=0. So T'=0. Correct.

Parity condition: L' + l must be odd.

In option B, emitted X is p → l=1.

L' is 0. So L' + l =0+1=1 → odd. So parity condition holds.

Now, check the initial J=0 and how it compares to the final state.

The J' of the NN' is 1 (from the term symbol 3S1, J'=1). The emitted X has orbital angular momentum l=1, but what about its spin? Wait, but perhaps I should think about the total angular momentum.

Wait, the initial J is 0. The final state is NN' with J' and X with j. So J' + j =0. But J and j are vectors, so their magnitudes must be the same and opposite in direction.

So J' must equal j. So j must be 1.

But the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l=1. But what about its spin? Well, the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it's spin-0, which is a pion, for example. Wait, but pions are spin-0. So if X is a pion, j would be l=1 and spin s=0. So j = l + s =1 +0=1. So j=1.

So, J' is 1, j is 1. So 1 + 1=2, but in vectors, to get zero, you need them opposite. So that's possible if the vector sum is zero, but it's not possible if their magnitudes are the same. Because |1 -1|=0. So it's possible, yes. Wait, that would require that J' and j have opposite directions, but same magnitude. So yes, it's allowed.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

Final NN' state is 3D3. So term symbol 3D3: 2S' +1=3 → S'=1. L'=D → 2. J'=3.

So T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2 → 1 +2 +1=4 → mod 2=0. Correct.

Parity condition: L' + l =2 + (f's l). Wait, the emitted particle is f, which is l=3.

So L' + l =2+3=5 → odd. So parity condition holds.

But let's check the initial angular momentum.

The initial J is 0. The final J' is 3, and the emitted X's j is sqrt(l(l+1) + s(s+1)) … but wait, X's spin isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, but the emitted X's orbital angular momentum is l=3, and assuming it's a boson (like a pion, but wait, pions are spin-0. Alternatively, perhaps it's a higher spin particle, but the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1, but not its spin. Hmm. Maybe this is a point to consider.

Wait, but X's spin is s. So X's total angular momentum j is sqrt(l + s) ... no, actually, it's l and s that combine to make j. But without knowing s, perhaps we can't proceed. So maybe I should proceed without considering spin, but only the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but for the parity condition, we've already handled that. So perhaps the key is to focus on the other conditions.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

Final state is 3P0. So 2S' +1=3 → S'=1. L' is P →1. J'=0.

So T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2 →1 +1 +1=3 → mod 2=1. But T' is supposed to be zero. So this doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, so T' would be 1, which contradicts the given T'=0. So this option is not allowed.

Wait, but wait: the Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2. So if T' is 0, then S' + L' +1 must be even? Wait, the equation is T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2.

In option D: S'=1, L'=1. So 1 +1 +1=3 → mod 2 is 1. So T' =1. But the problem states that T' is 0. So this option doesn't satisfy the condition, so it's not allowed.

Wait, but I thought the parity condition would be the key. But in this case, the isospin condition is violated, making this option impossible.

Wait, but let me also check the parity condition for option D.

Option D: X is s, so l=0.

L' is 1. So L' + l =1 +0=1→ odd. So parity condition holds.

But because the isospin condition is not met (T'=1 instead of 0), this option is invalid.

So which options are allowed and which are not?

So, the problem states that the final state has T=0. So any option where T' is not zero is invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: T'=0 → allowed.

Option B: T'=0 → allowed.

Option C: T'=0 → allowed.

Option D: T'=1 → not allowed.

So the answer must be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option D's final state is 3P0, so S'=1, L'=1.

So T'=1 +1 +1 mod 2 =3 mod 2=1. Which is not zero, so it's invalid. So option D is not allowed.

So the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the incorrect one is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting particle \( X \), the NN system transitions to a new state with \( T(NN) = 0 \). The isospin condition requires \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \mod 2 \). Substituting \( T(NN) = 0 \), we find \( S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \), meaning \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) must be odd.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of \( X \). Since the initial parity is \( 1 \), the final parity must also be \( 1 \). The parity of the NN system is \( (-1)^{L(NN)} \), and the parity of \( X \) is given as \( -1 \). Thus, \( (-1)^{L(NN)} \cdot (-1) = 1 \), implying \( (-1)^{L(NN)} = -1 \). Therefore, \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum \( J \) of the system must be conserved. Initially, \( J = 0 \), so the final state must also have \( J = 0 \).
