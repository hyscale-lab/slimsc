Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think through this.

First, what's C3H symmetry? I remember that the notation CnH refers to a cyclic group of order n with a horizontal mirror plane. So C3H would mean a three-fold rotational axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. No, I think CnH is a symmetry operation that includes a rotation by 180/n degrees followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Or wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh right, C3H would imply a three-fold rotation followed by a reflection in a horizontal plane. Or is it that the H is a horizontal mirror plane that works in conjunction with the rotation?

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh, right, the H stands for horizontal. So the symmetry operation is a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees, followed by a reflection across a horizontal plane. Alternatively, it might be that the group includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane as separate symmetries, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis. So the presence of both would collectively give C3H symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps C3H refers to the molecule having a three-fold axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), but I'm not 100% confident. I think another way: The group CHn has n-fold rotation and a single horizontal mirror plane. So C3H would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have both a three-fold rotation symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Wait, but maybe the notation is a bit different. Let me think. In point groups, the Cn group refers to a cyclic rotation. The H in CnH refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So for C3H, it would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. Or wait, the horizontal plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis?

Wait, no. In point group notation, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is a reflection plane that contains the rotation axis. So for example, in a molecule with a C2 axis, a horizontal σh would have the mirror plane passing through the axis. So then, for C3H, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane that contains this axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotation as a symmetry and also a horizontal mirror plane as a symmetry. So the molecule must be symmetric under both operations.

So now, I need to look at each of the given molecules and see which one has both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So I need to examine each of these compounds.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I think the structure has a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. So the molecule is similar to triphenylborane but with isopropyl groups instead. The structure would have a trigonal planar geometry around boron. Wait, but is it symmetric?

Each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borate would have the structure (i-Pr)3B. Each i-Pr is a substituent attached to the boron. Since all three are the same, the molecule is symmetric. The molecule is trigonal planar around B. So any plane that goes through the boron and one of the C(CH2)3 groups would be a mirror plane. Wait, but for a horizontal mirror plane—wait, in this context, the horizontal plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize it. The molecule is trigonal planar. The rotation axis is along the boron and perpendicular to the plane of the substituents. So if the substituents are all the same, then a three-fold rotation (C3) is a symmetry. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

A horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that lies perpendicular to the main rotation axis. Wait, but in this case, the rotation axis is going through the boron and the centers of the substituents. So the mirror plane would be a plane that's cutting through the molecule. For example, imagine looking at the molecule from above; the mirror plane could be a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis and bisects the molecule.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is symmetric, so perhaps it has a plane that's a mirror. For example, if you take a plane that's perpendicular to the boron's plane and passes through the boron, perhaps that's a mirror plane. But I'm not sure if that's a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sigma v (vertical mirror plane) rather than horizontal.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. Its structure is a norbornane-like structure, but I think it's a seven-membered ring. Wait, no, quinuclidine has a bicyclic structure with two rings: a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring, or is it another structure? Alternatively, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane would have three bridgeheads, but I'm not certain.

But more importantly, does quinuclidine have a C3H symmetry? I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Let me recall: the molecule has a bridge structure, and the central atom (like a nitrogen) is part of a bridge. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen at one position. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis. So it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, if it has a three-fold rotation, then maybe it also has a horizontal mirror plane. I'm not so sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have the mirror plane. So perhaps it only has C3 symmetry, not C3H.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric under both rotation and reflection, then it would have C3H symmetry. I'm not sure about quinuclidine. I think it's a non-planar molecule, maybe with a three-fold axis but perhaps without a mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chiral molecule. Wait, quinuclidine is actually a known structure—it's a secondary amine. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. It's a highly symmetric molecule. Let me think: the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. To determine if there's a horizontal mirror plane, I'd imagine cutting it with a plane. I'm trying to visualize—if I imagine looking along the three-fold axis, would there be a reflection plane that's horizontal? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry, but it's a vertical plane, not horizontal. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, meaning it only has C3 symmetry, not C3H.

So perhaps option D doesn't have C3H.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a benzo-fused trifuran with three rings. The numbering suggests the substituents are at certain positions. Trifuran indicates three furan rings. The benzo part is fused in a certain way. Wait, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So each c, c', c'' refers to the positions where the benzene is fused to the furan rings.

So the molecule would have three furan rings connected in a way that a benzene ring is fused to each of them. Or perhaps it's a central benzene ring with three furan substituents. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the structure is a molecule with three furan rings fused to a benzene ring in a certain arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where three furan rings are connected, with each furan attached to a benzene ring. Not sure, but maybe the molecule has some symmetry.

If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps it has a three-fold rotation axis. Let me think: if the three substituents are arranged symmetrically around the benzene ring, maybe in a triangular fashion. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation symmetry. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry is lower. For example, maybe it's only C2 or C3, but without a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, so the mirror plane could be the plane of the molecule itself. In that case, for a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, the point group would be D3h or something else. Wait, the point group for benzene is D6h, but when fused with other rings, the symmetry might be lower.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each option's structure.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Again, a complex name. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl rings attached. The rest is similar to option B.

So it's a trifuran (three furan rings) fused with three phenyl rings in a certain way.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule has a central structure with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically.

If the substituents are arranged symmetrically with three-fold rotation, then it could have C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe the three substituents are arranged such that there's a three-fold rotation, but without a mirror plane. Or perhaps there is a mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps all the options except option C (triisopropyl borate) are too complex. Let me think about option C again.

Triisopropyl borate: (i-Pr)3B. The structure has B at the center, with three i-Pr groups attached. Each i-Pr is (CH(CH2)2)3, so they are all the same. So the molecule has a trigonal planar structure around B. The molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane?

In the trigonal planar structure, any plane that passes through the B atom and one of the substituents would be a vertical mirror plane. But for a horizontal mirror plane, I think the plane would be perpendicular to the trigonal plane. For example, imagine a plane cutting through the molecule such that it's below the B atom and the substituents. Or perhaps not. Wait, in this case, the molecule is symmetric with three identical substituents, so any plane that is a mirror would have to pass through B. But a horizontal mirror plane would need to reflect the substituents into each other. Wait, perhaps if you have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane and passes through B, then reflecting across that plane would swap the substituents in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple mirror planes. Let me think: the molecule is (i-Pr)3B, which is symmetric. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and also three mirror planes that each bisect the angle between two substituents. But those would be vertical mirror planes, not horizontal. So to have a horizontal mirror plane, the plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think about where the substituents are. The substituents are all the same, so any rotation (C3) is a symmetry. Now, a horizontal mirror plane would require that for every atom above the plane, there's a corresponding atom below. But in the case of (i-Pr)3B, the molecule lies in a single plane (the trigonal plane), so a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane itself. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—if the molecule is in a trigonal planar arrangement, a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is the plane that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane and passes through the boron atom.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the point group of triisopropylborane. Triisopropylborane is a trigonal planar molecule, so its point group is D3h, I believe. Because it has a C3 rotation, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, D3h implies that it has a three-fold rotation (C3), horizontal mirror (σh), and other operations. So if the point group is D3h, then it has C3H symmetry. Because C3H is part of D3h.

Wait, wait. Point groups: D3h has several symmetry elements. It includes a C3 rotation, a σh (horizontal mirror), and three vertical mirror planes. So yes, the presence of both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane would imply C3H symmetry.

So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it indeed has C3H symmetry.

Now, looking back at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. So if that's correct, then option C is the answer.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me check the other options again.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The structure here is a benzo-fused trifuran. So perhaps it's a central benzene ring with three furan rings attached in a symmetric way. If it's symmetric, maybe it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to have a higher symmetry, but perhaps it's a planar molecule with multiple substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a three-fold rotation axis but maybe a lower symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar with a C3 axis. Let me imagine the structure: three furan rings attached to a benzene in such a way that each is at 120 degrees. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation. What about a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric top and bottom, perhaps the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (the benzene ring's plane, perhaps) would be a mirror. So maybe it has C3H symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's see: in such a structure, perhaps the plane of the benzene ring is a horizontal mirror plane. So if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion around it, then the mirror plane would lie in the benzene's plane. So that could be a horizontal mirror plane.

If this is the case, then this molecule would have both C3 and σh, leading to C3H symmetry.

But then why isn't this the correct answer? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the molecule is three-dimensional and not flat, then a horizontal mirror plane might not exist.

This is getting complicated. Let me think of each option again.

Option C: triisopropylborane. As discussed, it's likely to have D3h symmetry, so it has C3H.

Option A and B are more complex, but perhaps their structures don't have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotation axis but I'm not sure about a horizontal mirror. If the molecule is chiral, then it can't have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen in the bridge. The molecule is symmetric but does it have a mirror plane? I think it's not chiral. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually not chiral because the nitrogen is in a position where it's not leading to optical isomerism. But does it have a mirror plane?

If quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane, but the mirror plane is vertical (not horizontal), then it would have C3v symmetry but not C3H.

So, going back, the triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, which includes both C3 and σh. So it has C3H symmetry.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃H** symmetry, we analyze the given options. **C₃H** symmetry refers to the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). This combination implies that the molecule must be symmetric under both a 120° rotation and a reflection across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule consists of a central trifuran structure fused with three phenyl rings. While it may have some symmetry, the arrangement of the phenyl rings and the fused furan system does not clearly exhibit both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it likely lacks **C₃H** symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran with three furan rings. The symmetry of the molecule depends on the arrangement of the fused rings. While it may have a three-fold rotational axis, there is no clear indication of a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it likely does not possess **C₃H** symmetry.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate ((i-Pr)₃B)**  
   This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom gives the molecule a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane. This combination of symmetries places the molecule in the **D₃h** point group, which includes **C₃H** symmetry. Thus, this molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃H** symmetry.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), as the molecule is not symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Therefore, it does not possess **C₃H** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The only molecule that exhibits both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, thereby having **C₃H** symmetry, is **triisopropyl borate**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think through this.

First, what's C3H symmetry? I remember that the notation CnH refers to a cyclic group of order n with a horizontal mirror plane. So C3H would mean a three-fold rotational axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. No, I think CnH is a symmetry operation that includes a rotation by 180/n degrees followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Or wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh right, C3H would imply a three-fold rotation followed by a reflection in a horizontal plane. Or is it that the H is a horizontal mirror plane that works in conjunction with the rotation?

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh, right, the H stands for horizontal. So the symmetry operation is a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees, followed by a reflection across a horizontal plane. Alternatively, it might be that the group includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane as separate symmetries, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis. So the presence of both would collectively give C3H symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps C3H refers to the molecule having a three-fold axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), but I'm not 100% confident. I think another way: The group CHn has n-fold rotation and a single horizontal mirror plane. So C3H would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have both a three-fold rotation symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Wait, but maybe the notation is a bit different. Let me think. In point groups, the Cn group refers to a cyclic rotation. The H in CnH refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So for C3H, it would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. Or wait, the horizontal plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis?

Wait, no. In point group notation, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is a reflection plane that contains the rotation axis. So for example, in a molecule with a C2 axis, a horizontal σh would have the mirror plane passing through the axis. So then, for C3H, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane that contains this axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotation as a symmetry and also a horizontal mirror plane as a symmetry. So the molecule must be symmetric under both operations.

So now, I need to look at each of the given molecules and see which one has both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So I need to examine each of these compounds.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I think the structure has a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. So the molecule is similar to triphenylborane but with isopropyl groups instead. The structure would have a trigonal planar geometry around boron. Wait, but is it symmetric?

Each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borate would have the structure (i-Pr)3B. Each i-Pr is a substituent attached to the boron. Since all three are the same, the molecule is symmetric. The molecule is trigonal planar around B. So any plane that goes through the boron and one of the C(CH2)3 groups would be a mirror plane. Wait, but for a horizontal mirror plane—wait, in this context, the horizontal plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize it. The molecule is trigonal planar. The rotation axis is along the boron and perpendicular to the plane of the substituents. So if the substituents are all the same, then a three-fold rotation (C3) is a symmetry. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

A horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that lies perpendicular to the main rotation axis. Wait, but in this case, the rotation axis is going through the boron and the centers of the substituents. So the mirror plane would be a plane that's cutting through the molecule. For example, imagine looking at the molecule from above; the mirror plane could be a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis and bisects the molecule.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is symmetric, so perhaps it has a plane that's a mirror. For example, if you take a plane that's perpendicular to the boron's plane and passes through the boron, perhaps that's a mirror plane. But I'm not sure if that's a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sigma v (vertical mirror plane) rather than horizontal.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. Its structure is a norbornane-like structure, but I think it's a seven-membered ring. Wait, no, quinuclidine has a bicyclic structure with two rings: a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring, or is it another structure? Alternatively, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane would have three bridgeheads, but I'm not certain.

But more importantly, does quinuclidine have a C3H symmetry? I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Let me recall: the molecule has a bridge structure, and the central atom (like a nitrogen) is part of a bridge. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen at one position. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis. So it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, if it has a three-fold rotation, then maybe it also has a horizontal mirror plane. I'm not so sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have the mirror plane. So perhaps it only has C3 symmetry, not C3H.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric under both rotation and reflection, then it would have C3H symmetry. I'm not sure about quinuclidine. I think it's a non-planar molecule, maybe with a three-fold axis but perhaps without a mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chiral molecule. Wait, quinuclidine is actually a known structure—it's a secondary amine. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. It's a highly symmetric molecule. Let me think: the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. To determine if there's a horizontal mirror plane, I'd imagine cutting it with a plane. I'm trying to visualize—if I imagine looking along the three-fold axis, would there be a reflection plane that's horizontal? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry, but it's a vertical plane, not horizontal. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, meaning it only has C3 symmetry, not C3H.

So perhaps option D doesn't have C3H.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a benzo-fused trifuran with three rings. The numbering suggests the substituents are at certain positions. Trifuran indicates three furan rings. The benzo part is fused in a certain way. Wait, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So each c, c', c'' refers to the positions where the benzene is fused to the furan rings.

So the molecule would have three furan rings connected in a way that a benzene ring is fused to each of them. Or perhaps it's a central benzene ring with three furan substituents. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the structure is a molecule with three furan rings fused to a benzene ring in a certain arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where three furan rings are connected, with each furan attached to a benzene ring. Not sure, but maybe the molecule has some symmetry.

If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps it has a three-fold rotation axis. Let me think: if the three substituents are arranged symmetrically around the benzene ring, maybe in a triangular fashion. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation symmetry. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry is lower. For example, maybe it's only C2 or C3, but without a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, so the mirror plane could be the plane of the molecule itself. In that case, for a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, the point group would be D3h or something else. Wait, the point group for benzene is D6h, but when fused with other rings, the symmetry might be lower.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each option's structure.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Again, a complex name. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl rings attached. The rest is similar to option B.

So it's a trifuran (three furan rings) fused with three phenyl rings in a certain way.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule has a central structure with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically.

If the substituents are arranged symmetrically with three-fold rotation, then it could have C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe the three substituents are arranged such that there's a three-fold rotation, but without a mirror plane. Or perhaps there is a mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps all the options except option C (triisopropyl borate) are too complex. Let me think about option C again.

Triisopropyl borate: (i-Pr)3B. The structure has B at the center, with three i-Pr groups attached. Each i-Pr is (CH(CH2)2)3, so they are all the same. So the molecule has a trigonal planar structure around B. The molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane?

In the trigonal planar structure, any plane that passes through the B atom and one of the substituents would be a vertical mirror plane. But for a horizontal mirror plane, I think the plane would be perpendicular to the trigonal plane. For example, imagine a plane cutting through the molecule such that it's below the B atom and the substituents. Or perhaps not. Wait, in this case, the molecule is symmetric with three identical substituents, so any plane that is a mirror would have to pass through B. But a horizontal mirror plane would need to reflect the substituents into each other. Wait, perhaps if you have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane and passes through B, then reflecting across that plane would swap the substituents in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple mirror planes. Let me think: the molecule is (i-Pr)3B, which is symmetric. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and also three mirror planes that each bisect the angle between two substituents. But those would be vertical mirror planes, not horizontal. So to have a horizontal mirror plane, the plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think about where the substituents are. The substituents are all the same, so any rotation (C3) is a symmetry. Now, a horizontal mirror plane would require that for every atom above the plane, there's a corresponding atom below. But in the case of (i-Pr)3B, the molecule lies in a single plane (the trigonal plane), so a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane itself. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—if the molecule is in a trigonal planar arrangement, a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is the plane that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane and passes through the boron atom.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the point group of triisopropylborane. Triisopropylborane is a trigonal planar molecule, so its point group is D3h, I believe. Because it has a C3 rotation, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, D3h implies that it has a three-fold rotation (C3), horizontal mirror (σh), and other operations. So if the point group is D3h, then it has C3H symmetry. Because C3H is part of D3h.

Wait, wait. Point groups: D3h has several symmetry elements. It includes a C3 rotation, a σh (horizontal mirror), and three vertical mirror planes. So yes, the presence of both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane would imply C3H symmetry.

So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it indeed has C3H symmetry.

Now, looking back at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. So if that's correct, then option C is the answer.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me check the other options again.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The structure here is a benzo-fused trifuran. So perhaps it's a central benzene ring with three furan rings attached in a symmetric way. If it's symmetric, maybe it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to have a higher symmetry, but perhaps it's a planar molecule with multiple substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a three-fold rotation axis but maybe a lower symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar with a C3 axis. Let me imagine the structure: three furan rings attached to a benzene in such a way that each is at 120 degrees. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation. What about a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric top and bottom, perhaps the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (the benzene ring's plane, perhaps) would be a mirror. So maybe it has C3H symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's see: in such a structure, perhaps the plane of the benzene ring is a horizontal mirror plane. So if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion around it, then the mirror plane would lie in the benzene's plane. So that could be a horizontal mirror plane.

If this is the case, then this molecule would have both C3 and σh, leading to C3H symmetry.

But then why isn't this the correct answer? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the molecule is three-dimensional and not flat, then a horizontal mirror plane might not exist.

This is getting complicated. Let me think of each option again.

Option C: triisopropylborane. As discussed, it's likely to have D3h symmetry, so it has C3H.

Option A and B are more complex, but perhaps their structures don't have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotation axis but I'm not sure about a horizontal mirror. If the molecule is chiral, then it can't have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen in the bridge. The molecule is symmetric but does it have a mirror plane? I think it's not chiral. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually not chiral because the nitrogen is in a position where it's not leading to optical isomerism. But does it have a mirror plane?

If quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane, but the mirror plane is vertical (not horizontal), then it would have C3v symmetry but not C3H.

So, going back, the triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, which includes both C3 and σh. So it has C3H symmetry.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃H** symmetry, we analyze the given options. **C₃H** symmetry refers to the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). This combination implies that the molecule must be symmetric under both a 120° rotation and a reflection across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule consists of a central trifuran structure fused with three phenyl rings. While it may have some symmetry, the arrangement of the phenyl rings and the fused furan system does not clearly exhibit both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it likely lacks **C₃H** symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran with three furan rings. The symmetry of the molecule depends on the arrangement of the fused rings. While it may have a three-fold rotational axis, there is no clear indication of a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it likely does not possess **C₃H** symmetry.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate ((i-Pr)₃B)**  
   This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom gives the molecule a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane. This combination of symmetries places the molecule in the **D₃h** point group, which includes **C₃H** symmetry. Thus, this molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃H** symmetry.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), as the molecule is not symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Therefore, it does not possess **C₃H** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The only molecule that exhibits both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, thereby having **C₃H** symmetry, is **triisopropyl borate**.
