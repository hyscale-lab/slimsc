Okay, I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

So, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so if the ejecta is moving towards the center, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in inertial frames, velocities are relative, but I'm not sure if this is a case of relative velocity or something else.

The problem asks what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, because time can differ between frames due to relativity, but wait, this might get complicated. Oh, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's a simple velocity problem without considering acceleration or other factors.

Wait, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So if the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Oh, right, because of time dilation. Because if the frames are moving relative to each other, time will pass at different rates.

In special relativity, the time experienced in one frame (proper time) is related to the time in another frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time (in the ejecta's frame), and t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But wait, the relative velocity here is v = 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because standard units are better. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, wait, no, wait. 60,000 km is 6e4, times 1e3 m/km is 6e7 m/s? Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Multiply by 1e3 m/km: 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s. Oh right, that's 60 million meters per second, which is 6*10^7 m/s.

But wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is 0.2 times the speed of light. So beta (v/c) is 0.2.

The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Let's compute that. Beta is 0.2, so beta squared is 0.04. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98. So gamma is 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

So, the time in the Galaxy frame is t = gamma * t'. t' is 50 seconds. So t ≈ 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, that's just a small increase due to gamma. But wait, wait a minute—does the problem require us to consider which frame is which? Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. But the time experienced in the Galaxy frame is longer than the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving, and time in the Galaxy would be dilated as seen from the ejecta.

Wait, no. Time dilation depends on the frame. If the two frames are moving relative to each other, each frame considers the other's clock to be running slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Actually, in the Galileoian relativity (non-relativistic), the time would be the same in both frames, but in special relativity, it's different. The proper time is the shortest time between two events. So if the ejecta's frame is the rest frame of the supernova ejecta, then the time t' is the proper time for the events (maybe the emission of light from the supernova and its arrival at some point in the ejecta's frame). But perhaps that's complicating it.

Wait, the problem states that the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds. So how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, the time in the Galaxy frame will be longer.

The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time. Wait, but which frame is the proper time in? Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. So, in the ejecta's frame, the two events (ejecta here at t'=0 and t'=50) occur at the same location, so t' is the proper time. Therefore, the Galaxy frame will see a longer time: t = gamma * t'.

So, with gamma as calculated before ≈1.0204, t ≈50 * 1.0204 ≈51.02 seconds.

Wait, but I thought that in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be longer, but wait, the movement is such that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, let me think again. The time in the ejecta's frame is t', the proper time. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t'. So the Galaxy's frame will see more time passing.

Once I have t, I can multiply it by the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame to get the distance.

So speed is 60,000 km/s. Time in Galaxy frame is ~51.02 seconds. So distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 60,000 *51.02 = ?

Wait, 60,000 *50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.02 is 61,200. So total is 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, the options are A:2.94e6, B:3e6, C:2.88e6, D:3.06e6. So D is 3,060,000, which is very close to my calculation of 3,061,200. Hmm, perhaps I approximated gamma too roughly.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Beta is 0.2. So beta squared is 0.04. 1 - beta^2 is 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Wait, sqrt(24)= approximately 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 is around 0.9798. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is 1/0.9798 ≈1.0203.

So gamma is approximately 1.0203.

t = 50 * 1.0203 = 51.015 seconds.

Now, the distance is speed * time: 60,000 km/s * 51.015 s = ?

Compute 60,000 *51.015 = 60,000 * (50 +1.015) = 60,000*50 + 60,000*1.015 = 3,000,000 + 60,000 *1.015.

60,000 * 1 = 60,000. 60,000 *0.015=900. So 60,000 + 900 = 60,900.

So 3,000,000 + 60,900 = 3,060,900 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So perhaps the approximation of gamma is more precise, but the options only have D as 3,060,000.

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says the ejecta is moving in the Galaxy's frame. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is t, which is longer than t' by a factor of gamma.

So distance in Galaxy frame is v * t = 60,000 * t.

But wait, another approach: maybe using length contraction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the distance is contracted. Wait, but the problem is not about distance between two points but the distance the ejecta travels. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So the distance the Galaxy's center moves in the ejecta's frame is v * t', but wait, no, because the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, so the distance is v * t'.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the distance the galaxy moves is 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km.

Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the ejecta would have traveled a longer distance.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous approach. Oh, I'm getting confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, let's think carefully. The question is: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So in the ejecta's frame, time is t'=50 s. We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, t.

We can relate t and t' via the time dilation formula. Since the frames are moving relative to each other at speed v, the proper time (t') is related to the coordinate time (t) by t = gamma t'.

So, using that, t = gamma * 50 s. Then, the distance is v * t.

Wait, but the velocity v is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is 60,000 km/s.

So, distance = 60,000 km/s * gamma * 50 s.

Wait, gamma is approximately 1.0203, so:

Distance = 60,000 * 1.0203 *50.

Compute that:

60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.

3,000,000 * 1.0203 = 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 *0.0203.

0.0203 *3e6 = 60,900.

So 3,000,000 +60,900=3,060,900 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is the closest. So I think the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let's check if I got the direction right. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it, but in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So the direction is same in both frames, just the velocity is same magnitude but opposite direction. So the distance in the galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is longer, so more distance.

So yes, the calculation seems correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta moves towards the Galaxy at a speed of **60,000 km/s** in the Galaxy's frame. The problem specifies that **50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame**, and we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during this time.

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, time dilation relates the proper time \( t' \) (measured in the ejecta's frame) to the coordinate time \( t \) (measured in the Galaxy's frame) using the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \).  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   The relative velocity between the frames is \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \). The Lorentz factor is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}, \quad \text{where } \beta = \frac{v}{c}, \, c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \beta = 0.2 \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203.
   \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using the time dilation formula:
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t.
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   Among the given options:
   - \( \text{A: } 2,940,000 \, \text{km} \)
   - \( \text{B: } 3,000,000 \, \text{km} \)
   - \( \text{C: } 2,880,000 \, \text{km} \)
   - \( \text{D: } 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)

   The calculated distance \( 3,060,900 \, \text{km} \) is closest to option \( \text{D: } 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.
