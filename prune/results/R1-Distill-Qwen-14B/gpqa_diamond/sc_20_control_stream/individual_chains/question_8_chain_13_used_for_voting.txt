Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine plants looking for genes that contribute to resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knockout mutants for each of these genes—g1, g2, g3—and also some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

The key point mentioned is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. So if one is upstream, it might regulate the others.

They tested these mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100%, so higher means more resistance. Let's look at the data:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (moderately resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. So, the single mutants: g2 is the most affected, with zero resistance. G1 has a partial resistance loss, and G3 has 50% resistance. The double mutants are even worse. Let's think about what this might mean.

I remember that when looking at gene interactions, especially epistasis, we can learn about the order of genes in a pathway. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a mutation in gene A completely masks the mutation in gene B, then A is epistatic to B. But I need to think about how this applies here.

In terms of resistance, if a gene is a transcription factor upstream, it would regulate other genes. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, knocking it out (g2) would disable the downstream genes it controls, leading to a complete loss of resistance. That seems to fit with the data because g2 has 0% resistance. Similarly, the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also have 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is acting upstream and is essential for any resistance. Without G2, even if other genes are present, they can't contribute because their activity is dependent on G2.

Looking at G1: the single mutant g1 is at 75%, which is less than wild-type. So, perhaps G1 contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. But when you make the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%—same as g2. But that might just be because g2 is already 0%, so the double mutant would be as bad as g2. Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So, the presence of g1 in the double mutant with g3 makes it even worse.

Wait, this might suggest that G3's function is somehow dependent on G1, or vice versa. Or maybe they're in the same pathway.

Looking at the double mutants:

- When you have g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- When g1g3: 10% (worse than either)
- When g2g3: 0% (same as g2)

So, the presence of G2 is critical. Because any double mutant without G2 (i.e., g1g2 and g2g3) is as bad as g2 alone. But the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So, the effect of G1 and G3 isn't simply additive. Maybe they function in parallel pathways, and when both are knocked out, the resistance drops even more.

Wait, but in the case of g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So, the effects are additive or multiplicative.

But how does this fit into the idea that one is a transcription factor upstream of others?

Let me try to model the possible pathways.

If G2 is the transcription factor, it might activate G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to no resistance. Hence, g2 is 0% because both downstream genes aren't active. But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance, which would mean that their products are functional when present. So, perhaps G2 is regulating another gene, not necessarily both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates another gene (let's call it Gene X), and both G1 and G3 are also involved in the same pathway, maybe acting on Gene X as well. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me approach this from the perspective of epistasis.

The presence of a double mutant with resistance worse than either single mutant suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. So, the combined loss of both reduces resistance more than losing either alone. For example, if G1 and G3 each contribute independently to resistance, then when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse. But in this case, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%).

Wait, but in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is much lower than either. So, perhaps both G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and when both are missing, the pathway is completely inactive. But then why is g2g3 0%? Because without G2, perhaps the pathway is already inactive. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But wait, in the data, g2 is 0% resistance, but the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. So how does that fit?

Wait, that can't be right. If G2 is a transcription factor activating G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean that G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3 have some expression of the other gene. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are each regulated by G2, but they can function in the absence of each other.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either alone. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, where each can contribute when the other is missing. But when both are missing, the pathway is severely compromised.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about each gene's effect:

G2 has the most severe phenotype, 0%, so it's likely the most important. It's probably the transcription factor because the question states that at least one is a TF upstream.

When G2 is knocked out, all the downstream resistance mechanisms are gone because the transcription factor isn't there to activate the necessary genes. So, in g2, no resistance.

In the double mutants where G2 is missing (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, the presence of g1 or g3 doesn't affect this because without G2, they can't function.

Now, looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10%. So, when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is much lower than either alone.

In the single mutants:

- G1 knockout (g1) has 75% resistance. So, G1 contributes to resistance, but perhaps not as crucially as G2. Because in the absence of G1, the plant can still resist the pathogen at 75% efficiency.

- G3 knockout (g3) is 50% resistance. So, G3's role is less than G1's.

So, what's happening in the g1g3 double mutant where both are missing? It's 10% resistance. So, way worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are contributing to the same pathway, and their combined loss is much worse than either loss.

But how does this relate to the fact that G2 is a transcription factor?

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would eliminate both G1 and G3's expression. But the data shows that in their single knockouts, G1 and G3 are still expressed (since they have some resistance). So, maybe G2 isn't the only factor regulating them, or perhaps G1 and G3 can be regulated by other factors as well.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a TF upstream. So, perhaps G2 is the TF, but perhaps G1 and G3 have other inputs as well.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is a TF. But in that case, why is G2's knockout completely resistant?

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF that activates a downstream gene, say Gene X, which is necessary for resistance. G1 and G3 could be other genes that also affect the same pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the key TF that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes that contribute to resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF and g2 is 0%, then without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed? But in the data, the single mutants g1 and g3 are viable (they have some resistance). Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 are expressed even in the absence of G2, which wouldn't make sense if G2 is their TF. So maybe G2 isn't the TF for G1 and G3.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the control is wild-type, which has 100% resistance. So, the knockout mutants have lower resistance because they can't produce certain gene products. So, the function of the gene is important for resistance.

So, in the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → gene product of G1 contributes 25% to resistance.

- g2: 0% → gene product of G2 is critical.

- g3: 50% → gene product of G3 contributes 50% to resistance.

Double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% → combined, they contribute only 10%? Or perhaps the combined effect is multiplicative or additive.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, then the combined loss would have an additive effect. For example, if each contributes 25% and 50%, respectively, then together they might contribute 75% (but that doesn't fit the data). Alternatively, maybe they work in the same pathway, and each contributes a part of it, so without either, the pathway is compromised.

Wait, perhaps the data suggests that G2 is the main gene, acting upstream. Let's think: the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are 0% resistance. That suggests that without G2, the resistance is gone regardless of the presence of G1 or G3. So, G2's role is essential, perhaps as a TF that activates the necessary genes for resistance. So when G2 is absent, regardless of other genes, the plant can't resist.

But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, so maybe their functions are partially redundant or part of a secondary pathway. But without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't function because G2's product isn't there to activate them or something else.

Wait, but G1 and G3 are single mutants with some resistance. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly downstream of G2, but their functions are somehow additive. Alternatively, they are part of a broader network where G2 is a key activator, but their own functions contribute in other ways.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a gene (let's say Gene X) that is critical for resistance. Meanwhile, G1 and G3 are also involved in the same pathway but perhaps as activators of Gene X. So, if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then Gene X isn't activated, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but in the case where G2 is present, even if G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. But without G2, the resistance is 0%. So, perhaps G2 is essential for activating Gene X, but G1 and G3 can activate it as well, but not as effectively.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of a different pathway that also contributes to resistance, but only when G2 is present. Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to model the data again.

Resistance levels:

- Wild type: 100% (so maximum resistance)

G1 knockout: 75% → 25% less than wild type. So, G1 contributes 25% to resistance.

G2 knockout: 0% → G2 is essential.

G3 knockout: 50% → G3 contributes 50% to resistance.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → much less than either g1 or g3.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. So, when G2 is present (e.g., in g1g3), but G1 and G3 are not, the resistance is 10%. So, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present, the resistance is low. But wait, without G2, it's 0% regardless of other genes.

This suggests that G2 is an upstream gene whose product is necessary for the activity of G1 and G3. So, maybe G2's product is required for the function of G1 and G3. That would explain why in g1g3 (where G2 is present?), but wait no—g1g3 is a double mutant where both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. Wait, no, wait: the double mutant g1g3 is when G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, if G2 is present, why is the resistance only 10%? Because perhaps the other genes (G1 and G3) contribute to resistance when G2 is present.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about which genes are present in each mutant. Let me clarify:

- g1: G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are present.

- g2: G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 are present.

- g3: G3 is knocked out, G1 and G2 are present.

- g1g2: both G1 and G2 are knocked out; G3 is present.

- g1g3: both G1 and G3 are knocked out; G2 is present.

- g2g3: both G2 and G3 are knocked out; G1 is present.

Wait, no, that's not correct. In a double mutant, both genes are knocked out. So, in g1g3, G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So why is the resistance only 10%? Because in the presence of G2, but without G1 and G3, the plant can only have 10% resistance.

But wait, in the single mutant g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 are present, but resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is necessary for any resistance, regardless of G1 and G3.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates a downstream gene (let's say, Gene X) that is necessary for resistance. So, without G2, Gene X isn't expressed, and the plant can't resist the pathogen. But, G1 and G3 might be other genes that also contribute to resistance, but perhaps they are only active when Gene X is present.

Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Let me think again.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates Gene X, which is required for resistance. Then, without G2 (g2), Gene X isn't expressed, so resistance is 0%. But in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out but G2 is present, so Gene X is expressed, but maybe G1's product also contributes to resistance. So, in g1, the plant can still express Gene X (because G2 is present), but without G1, the resistance is 75% of wild type. Similarly, in g3, without G3, but G2 is present so Gene X is expressed, but resistance is 50% of wild type.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 function in the same pathway as Gene X, but their contributions are additive. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either alone. But when G2 is present, even if G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant can still express Gene X, but with reduced function because both G1 and G3 are missing, leading to lower resistance.

But wait, in that scenario, wouldn't the resistance in g1g3 be higher than 10% if Gene X is still active? Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are also upstream of Gene X, but that seems unlikely since G2 is the transcription factor.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But wait, in the data, the single mutants (g1 and g3) have some resistance. So, they must be able to express some other genes.

Wait, but if G2 is the only TF activating both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in the single mutants g1 and g3, those genes are present but not functional. So, perhaps G1 and G3 can be expressed without G2, but their expression is higher when G2 is present.

Wait, but that's confusing. Let me try to form a model.

Suppose:

- G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But:

In the single mutants:

- g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So, resistance would be based on G3's function. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, and g3 has 50%, which is lower than g1. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for another gene (Gene X), and G1 and G3 are also TFs that regulate Gene X. So, multiple TFs can activate Gene X. So, in the absence of G2, the other TFs (G1 and G3) can still activate Gene X, but not as effectively.

But in that case, knocking out G2 would mean that the activation of Gene X relies solely on G1 and G3, which may not be sufficient, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g2 has 0% resistance, which suggests that without G2, Gene X isn't active enough for any resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a master TF that is required for all resistance genes, so without it, nothing works.

But let's think about the double mutants. The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance. So, even though G2 is present, without G1 and G3, the resistance is low. So, perhaps G1 and G3 themselves are required for a certain level of resistance, but in the presence of G2, their absence leads to a low resistance.

But why is resistance so low when both are absent?

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype. For instance, if they are redundant (gene redundancy), then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one (g1 or g3) reduces resistance, but knocking out both (g1g3) would reduce it even more. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is way worse than either single mutant. So, that fits with redundancy. So, when G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is worse.

But wait, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so why is the resistance so low? Because G2's function isn't sufficient without G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates downstream genes, but G1 and G3 are also required for the function of those downstream genes. So, without G1 or G3, the downstream genes can't function properly.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's look at the answer options.

The options are:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1

Wait, wait. The question said that at least one is a TF. So, in option A, G1 is the TF, but according to the data, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which suggests G2 is the TF, not G1.

B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter? That would mean they are part of the same operon, which is more common in prokaryotes. But in plants, genes are usually not in operons. So, I'm not sure about this option.

C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. Also, G1 is epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes can compensate for each other. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone.

Wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, this fits with redundancy. Also, considering that G2 is the TF, and when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But what does that mean? It would mean that G1 is upstream of G3. So, the effect of G3 is dependent on G1.

Wait, but in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So, G1's effect is larger. So, maybe G1 is epistatic to G3. Hmm.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So, in terms of epistasis, the fact that the double mutant is worse than either suggests that they are in parallel pathways, not in the same pathway.

Wait, but for epistasis, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A masks the effect of gene B. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G1 would result in the same phenotype regardless of G3's status.

But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out (g3), it's 50%. So, G1's knockout has a bigger effect. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

In this case, neither is epistatic to the other. Because the effect isn't masked; instead, the effects add up.

Hmm, so maybe none of the options are perfect. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which is more severe, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. Don't think that's right.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic.

Wait, in the data, when G1 is not present (g1), the resistance is 75%. When G3 is not present (g3), 50%. So, G1's effect is bigger. So, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3. Because the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

Wait, but how? Let's think about the pathway.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that means that G1's function is upstream of G3. So, the activity of G3 depends on G1.

So, if G1 is knocked out, then G3 can't function regardless. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, whereas when G3 is knocked out (g3), it's 50%. So, that doesn't fit because if G1 is upstream, then knocking it out should make G3's knockout look the same. But in reality, the single mutants have different resistances.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it backwards. Maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, the function of G1 depends on G3. But that doesn't fit either because g1 has higher resistance than g3.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and each contributes a portion to resistance. So, knocking out both would cause a bigger drop in resistance than either alone. That's what the data says.

But how does this tie into the options?

Looking at option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have a worse phenotype than either alone. So, that fits the g1g3 data. But what about epistasis?

In gene redundancy, the presence of either gene can compensate. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G1 would result in the same phenotype as knocking out both. But in the data, when both are knocked out, it's worse than either. So, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, neither is epistatic to the other. But none of the options say that.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. But G2's knockout is the most severe, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but in this case, we're only looking at resistance.

Wait, but what's the definition of epistasis? It's when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3 depends on G1.

In the data, when G1 is knocked out, G3's presence doesn't matter. So, the resistance is 75% regardless of G3's status. But when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is lower than when G1 is present.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me think about the double mutants.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, the effect isn't masked, so perhaps they're in parallel pathways.

If G2 is the TF, then all the downstream effects depend on G2. So, the presence of G2 is necessary for any resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, perhaps G2's product can initiate a pathway, but both G1 and G3 contribute to the same process. So, without G1 and G3, the process can't proceed as efficiently.

But I'm not entirely certain about the epistatic relationship here.

Looking at the options again, the correct option seems to be D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: which options can be ruled out.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because g2 is 0%, suggesting G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (unlikely in plants), and G3 epistatic to G1.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

But I'm not sure about pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make the phenotype worse than the more severe single mutant. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either. So, that contradicts the idea of redundancy. Because in redundancy, the presence of either gene provides the necessary function. So, if both are knocked out, the phenotype would be the same as the more severe single mutant. But here, g1g3 is worse than either, so perhaps it's not redundancy.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing redundancy with complementary gene action. Redundancy would mean that both genes do the same thing, so losing both doesn't make things worse than losing one. But the data shows that losing both makes it worse. So, perhaps it's not redundancy.

So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (not redundant), and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So, perhaps the correct option is C or D.

Wait, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, the data suggests that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype, which could be because they function in parallel pathways.

But the options don't directly address that. So, perhaps the best fit is option D, considering that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is much lower than the wild type, but higher than zero. So, perhaps G2 is the TF, and when G1 and G3 are present, they contribute to the function. Therefore, without both, the pathway is severely affected.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about which option fits the data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 determines the phenotype regardless of G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, since G1 is knocked out, the effect is determined by G3's status. But since G1 is epistatic, G3's function is masked. But in reality, in g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, with G2 acting upstream. Their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype, meaning that each contributes to the same process but in a way that the loss of both is worse than either alone.

Looking at the options, the only one that says G2 is TF is option C or D.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I can't see how that applies here, as we're only looking at resistance.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as I thought earlier, redundancy would mean that the double mutant isn't worse than the more severe single mutant.

Hmm. Maybe the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. But the data contradicts that because the double mutant is worse than either. So, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the best fit is option D, assuming that the redundancy refers to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the right answer is option A, but I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: look for what each option says about the epistatic relationships.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, the effect of G1 is masked by G2. So, if G2 is present, the effect of G1 doesn't matter.

But in the data, when G2 is present (as in g1g3), the resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant. So, that suggests that G2's presence doesn't mask the effect of G1 and G3.

Alternatively, in the double mutant g1g2, G2 is knocked out. So, G2's presence is required for any resistance.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to pick the best option based on reasoning.

G2 is the transcription factor, which aligns with options C and D.

In the data, the double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either, suggesting that G1 and G3 are additive or in parallel. So, perhaps they are redundant, but not in the classical sense.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as I thought earlier, redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make the resistance worse than the more severe single mutant. But here, it does, so perhaps it's not redundancy.

Wait, maybe gene redundancy is when the two genes can perform the same function, so losing both doesn't change the phenotype beyond losing one. But in our data, losing both makes it worse, so perhaps it's not redundancy.

Hmm, perhaps another term applies. Gene dosage? Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function in a way that their combined loss has a more severe effect. Maybe they are part of the same complex, so both are needed for it to function. So, without either, the complex can't function, leading to lower resistance.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the answer options, the only one that says G2 is the TF and that the other two are in a redundant relationship is option D. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not clear on what 'show pleiotropy' means in this context. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here, G1 and G3 are two different genes affecting the same trait (resistance). So, perhaps that's not the right term.

Wait, perhaps 'show pleiotropy' is a misinterpretation. Maybe it's saying that G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, meaning each affects multiple traits, but that's not relevant here. So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but I'm not entirely confident. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but the double mutant is worse than either, which I'm not sure how to reconcile.

Wait, another angle: the presence of epistasis. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3 is dependent on G1. So, when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is irrelevant. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, and when G3 is knocked out (g3), it's 50%. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the resistance should be the same when G1 is knocked out regardless of G3's status. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1. So, that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

Hmm. Maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, when G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1's presence is irrelevant. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So, that suggests that G3's effect is more significant, but I'm not sure how that relates to epistasis.

I think I'm going around in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option D as the answer, because G2 is the TF, and the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting their functions are additive, perhaps due to redundancy, even though the data seems conflicting.

The question involves determining the interaction between three genes (G1, G2, and G3) contributing to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer the relationships between these genes, particularly focusing on whether one is a transcription factor (TF) and how they interact.

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (G1 contributes partially to resistance).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (G2 is essential for resistance; likely a transcription factor upstream of other genes).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (G3 contributes less than G1 to resistance).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2's role is critical and masks the contribution of G1).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive or synergistic effects of G1 and G3 in parallel pathways).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2's role is essential and masks the contribution of G3).

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.
- **Ruled out**: The data shows that G2 is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), suggesting G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Additionally, pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits) is not evident here, as the data focuses solely on resistance.

#### **Option B**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.
- **Ruled out**: While G2 is likely the transcription factor, the idea that G1 and G3 share the same promoter (common in prokaryotes but rare in plants) is unlikely. Furthermore, the data does not support G3 being epistatic to G1, as the resistance phenotype of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating additive effects rather than epistasis.

#### **Option C**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
- **Ruled out**: Pleiotropy is not applicable here, as the data focuses on resistance, a single trait. Additionally, the resistance phenotype of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which contradicts the idea of G1 being epistatic to G3. Epistasis would imply that the phenotype of one gene masks the other, which is not observed.

#### **Option D**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
- **Best fit**: G2 is the transcription factor, as indicated by the 0% resistance in g2. The data supports the idea of gene redundancy, where G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype (10% resistance in g1g3). However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is not fully supported by the data, as the resistance phenotype of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive rather than epistatic effects. Despite this, option D aligns most closely with the observed data compared to the other options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, **option D** is the most consistent with the data, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and accounts for the additive effects of G1 and G3 in the double mutant g1g3. While the claim about epistasis is not fully supported, it is the best fit among the given options.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine plants looking for genes that contribute to resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knockout mutants for each of these genes—g1, g2, g3—and also some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

The key point mentioned is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. So if one is upstream, it might regulate the others.

They tested these mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100%, so higher means more resistance. Let's look at the data:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (moderately resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. So, the single mutants: g2 is the most affected, with zero resistance. G1 has a partial resistance loss, and G3 has 50% resistance. The double mutants are even worse. Let's think about what this might mean.

I remember that when looking at gene interactions, especially epistasis, we can learn about the order of genes in a pathway. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a mutation in gene A completely masks the mutation in gene B, then A is epistatic to B. But I need to think about how this applies here.

In terms of resistance, if a gene is a transcription factor upstream, it would regulate other genes. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, knocking it out (g2) would disable the downstream genes it controls, leading to a complete loss of resistance. That seems to fit with the data because g2 has 0% resistance. Similarly, the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also have 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is acting upstream and is essential for any resistance. Without G2, even if other genes are present, they can't contribute because their activity is dependent on G2.

Looking at G1: the single mutant g1 is at 75%, which is less than wild-type. So, perhaps G1 contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. But when you make the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%—same as g2. But that might just be because g2 is already 0%, so the double mutant would be as bad as g2. Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So, the presence of g1 in the double mutant with g3 makes it even worse.

Wait, this might suggest that G3's function is somehow dependent on G1, or vice versa. Or maybe they're in the same pathway.

Looking at the double mutants:

- When you have g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- When g1g3: 10% (worse than either)
- When g2g3: 0% (same as g2)

So, the presence of G2 is critical. Because any double mutant without G2 (i.e., g1g2 and g2g3) is as bad as g2 alone. But the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So, the effect of G1 and G3 isn't simply additive. Maybe they function in parallel pathways, and when both are knocked out, the resistance drops even more.

Wait, but in the case of g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So, the effects are additive or multiplicative.

But how does this fit into the idea that one is a transcription factor upstream of others?

Let me try to model the possible pathways.

If G2 is the transcription factor, it might activate G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to no resistance. Hence, g2 is 0% because both downstream genes aren't active. But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance, which would mean that their products are functional when present. So, perhaps G2 is regulating another gene, not necessarily both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates another gene (let's call it Gene X), and both G1 and G3 are also involved in the same pathway, maybe acting on Gene X as well. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me approach this from the perspective of epistasis.

The presence of a double mutant with resistance worse than either single mutant suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. So, the combined loss of both reduces resistance more than losing either alone. For example, if G1 and G3 each contribute independently to resistance, then when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse. But in this case, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%).

Wait, but in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is much lower than either. So, perhaps both G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and when both are missing, the pathway is completely inactive. But then why is g2g3 0%? Because without G2, perhaps the pathway is already inactive. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But wait, in the data, g2 is 0% resistance, but the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. So how does that fit?

Wait, that can't be right. If G2 is a transcription factor activating G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean that G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3 have some expression of the other gene. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are each regulated by G2, but they can function in the absence of each other.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either alone. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, where each can contribute when the other is missing. But when both are missing, the pathway is severely compromised.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about each gene's effect:

G2 has the most severe phenotype, 0%, so it's likely the most important. It's probably the transcription factor because the question states that at least one is a TF upstream.

When G2 is knocked out, all the downstream resistance mechanisms are gone because the transcription factor isn't there to activate the necessary genes. So, in g2, no resistance.

In the double mutants where G2 is missing (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, the presence of g1 or g3 doesn't affect this because without G2, they can't function.

Now, looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10%. So, when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is much lower than either alone.

In the single mutants:

- G1 knockout (g1) has 75% resistance. So, G1 contributes to resistance, but perhaps not as crucially as G2. Because in the absence of G1, the plant can still resist the pathogen at 75% efficiency.

- G3 knockout (g3) is 50% resistance. So, G3's role is less than G1's.

So, what's happening in the g1g3 double mutant where both are missing? It's 10% resistance. So, way worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are contributing to the same pathway, and their combined loss is much worse than either loss.

But how does this relate to the fact that G2 is a transcription factor?

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would eliminate both G1 and G3's expression. But the data shows that in their single knockouts, G1 and G3 are still expressed (since they have some resistance). So, maybe G2 isn't the only factor regulating them, or perhaps G1 and G3 can be regulated by other factors as well.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a TF upstream. So, perhaps G2 is the TF, but perhaps G1 and G3 have other inputs as well.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is a TF. But in that case, why is G2's knockout completely resistant?

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF that activates a downstream gene, say Gene X, which is necessary for resistance. G1 and G3 could be other genes that also affect the same pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the key TF that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes that contribute to resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF and g2 is 0%, then without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed? But in the data, the single mutants g1 and g3 are viable (they have some resistance). Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 are expressed even in the absence of G2, which wouldn't make sense if G2 is their TF. So maybe G2 isn't the TF for G1 and G3.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the control is wild-type, which has 100% resistance. So, the knockout mutants have lower resistance because they can't produce certain gene products. So, the function of the gene is important for resistance.

So, in the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → gene product of G1 contributes 25% to resistance.

- g2: 0% → gene product of G2 is critical.

- g3: 50% → gene product of G3 contributes 50% to resistance.

Double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% → combined, they contribute only 10%? Or perhaps the combined effect is multiplicative or additive.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, then the combined loss would have an additive effect. For example, if each contributes 25% and 50%, respectively, then together they might contribute 75% (but that doesn't fit the data). Alternatively, maybe they work in the same pathway, and each contributes a part of it, so without either, the pathway is compromised.

Wait, perhaps the data suggests that G2 is the main gene, acting upstream. Let's think: the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are 0% resistance. That suggests that without G2, the resistance is gone regardless of the presence of G1 or G3. So, G2's role is essential, perhaps as a TF that activates the necessary genes for resistance. So when G2 is absent, regardless of other genes, the plant can't resist.

But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, so maybe their functions are partially redundant or part of a secondary pathway. But without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't function because G2's product isn't there to activate them or something else.

Wait, but G1 and G3 are single mutants with some resistance. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly downstream of G2, but their functions are somehow additive. Alternatively, they are part of a broader network where G2 is a key activator, but their own functions contribute in other ways.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a gene (let's say Gene X) that is critical for resistance. Meanwhile, G1 and G3 are also involved in the same pathway but perhaps as activators of Gene X. So, if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then Gene X isn't activated, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but in the case where G2 is present, even if G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. But without G2, the resistance is 0%. So, perhaps G2 is essential for activating Gene X, but G1 and G3 can activate it as well, but not as effectively.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of a different pathway that also contributes to resistance, but only when G2 is present. Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to model the data again.

Resistance levels:

- Wild type: 100% (so maximum resistance)

G1 knockout: 75% → 25% less than wild type. So, G1 contributes 25% to resistance.

G2 knockout: 0% → G2 is essential.

G3 knockout: 50% → G3 contributes 50% to resistance.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → much less than either g1 or g3.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. So, when G2 is present (e.g., in g1g3), but G1 and G3 are not, the resistance is 10%. So, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present, the resistance is low. But wait, without G2, it's 0% regardless of other genes.

This suggests that G2 is an upstream gene whose product is necessary for the activity of G1 and G3. So, maybe G2's product is required for the function of G1 and G3. That would explain why in g1g3 (where G2 is present?), but wait no—g1g3 is a double mutant where both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. Wait, no, wait: the double mutant g1g3 is when G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, if G2 is present, why is the resistance only 10%? Because perhaps the other genes (G1 and G3) contribute to resistance when G2 is present.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about which genes are present in each mutant. Let me clarify:

- g1: G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are present.

- g2: G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 are present.

- g3: G3 is knocked out, G1 and G2 are present.

- g1g2: both G1 and G2 are knocked out; G3 is present.

- g1g3: both G1 and G3 are knocked out; G2 is present.

- g2g3: both G2 and G3 are knocked out; G1 is present.

Wait, no, that's not correct. In a double mutant, both genes are knocked out. So, in g1g3, G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So why is the resistance only 10%? Because in the presence of G2, but without G1 and G3, the plant can only have 10% resistance.

But wait, in the single mutant g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 are present, but resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is necessary for any resistance, regardless of G1 and G3.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates a downstream gene (let's say, Gene X) that is necessary for resistance. So, without G2, Gene X isn't expressed, and the plant can't resist the pathogen. But, G1 and G3 might be other genes that also contribute to resistance, but perhaps they are only active when Gene X is present.

Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Let me think again.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates Gene X, which is required for resistance. Then, without G2 (g2), Gene X isn't expressed, so resistance is 0%. But in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out but G2 is present, so Gene X is expressed, but maybe G1's product also contributes to resistance. So, in g1, the plant can still express Gene X (because G2 is present), but without G1, the resistance is 75% of wild type. Similarly, in g3, without G3, but G2 is present so Gene X is expressed, but resistance is 50% of wild type.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 function in the same pathway as Gene X, but their contributions are additive. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either alone. But when G2 is present, even if G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant can still express Gene X, but with reduced function because both G1 and G3 are missing, leading to lower resistance.

But wait, in that scenario, wouldn't the resistance in g1g3 be higher than 10% if Gene X is still active? Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are also upstream of Gene X, but that seems unlikely since G2 is the transcription factor.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But wait, in the data, the single mutants (g1 and g3) have some resistance. So, they must be able to express some other genes.

Wait, but if G2 is the only TF activating both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in the single mutants g1 and g3, those genes are present but not functional. So, perhaps G1 and G3 can be expressed without G2, but their expression is higher when G2 is present.

Wait, but that's confusing. Let me try to form a model.

Suppose:

- G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But:

In the single mutants:

- g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So, resistance would be based on G3's function. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, and g3 has 50%, which is lower than g1. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for another gene (Gene X), and G1 and G3 are also TFs that regulate Gene X. So, multiple TFs can activate Gene X. So, in the absence of G2, the other TFs (G1 and G3) can still activate Gene X, but not as effectively.

But in that case, knocking out G2 would mean that the activation of Gene X relies solely on G1 and G3, which may not be sufficient, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g2 has 0% resistance, which suggests that without G2, Gene X isn't active enough for any resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a master TF that is required for all resistance genes, so without it, nothing works.

But let's think about the double mutants. The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance. So, even though G2 is present, without G1 and G3, the resistance is low. So, perhaps G1 and G3 themselves are required for a certain level of resistance, but in the presence of G2, their absence leads to a low resistance.

But why is resistance so low when both are absent?

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype. For instance, if they are redundant (gene redundancy), then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one (g1 or g3) reduces resistance, but knocking out both (g1g3) would reduce it even more. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is way worse than either single mutant. So, that fits with redundancy. So, when G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is worse.

But wait, in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so why is the resistance so low? Because G2's function isn't sufficient without G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates downstream genes, but G1 and G3 are also required for the function of those downstream genes. So, without G1 or G3, the downstream genes can't function properly.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's look at the answer options.

The options are:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1

Wait, wait. The question said that at least one is a TF. So, in option A, G1 is the TF, but according to the data, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which suggests G2 is the TF, not G1.

B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter? That would mean they are part of the same operon, which is more common in prokaryotes. But in plants, genes are usually not in operons. So, I'm not sure about this option.

C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. Also, G1 is epistatic to G3.

D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes can compensate for each other. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone.

Wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, this fits with redundancy. Also, considering that G2 is the TF, and when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But what does that mean? It would mean that G1 is upstream of G3. So, the effect of G3 is dependent on G1.

Wait, but in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So, G1's effect is larger. So, maybe G1 is epistatic to G3. Hmm.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So, in terms of epistasis, the fact that the double mutant is worse than either suggests that they are in parallel pathways, not in the same pathway.

Wait, but for epistasis, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A masks the effect of gene B. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G1 would result in the same phenotype regardless of G3's status.

But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out (g3), it's 50%. So, G1's knockout has a bigger effect. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

In this case, neither is epistatic to the other. Because the effect isn't masked; instead, the effects add up.

Hmm, so maybe none of the options are perfect. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which is more severe, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. Don't think that's right.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic.

Wait, in the data, when G1 is not present (g1), the resistance is 75%. When G3 is not present (g3), 50%. So, G1's effect is bigger. So, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3. Because the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

Wait, but how? Let's think about the pathway.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that means that G1's function is upstream of G3. So, the activity of G3 depends on G1.

So, if G1 is knocked out, then G3 can't function regardless. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, whereas when G3 is knocked out (g3), it's 50%. So, that doesn't fit because if G1 is upstream, then knocking it out should make G3's knockout look the same. But in reality, the single mutants have different resistances.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it backwards. Maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, the function of G1 depends on G3. But that doesn't fit either because g1 has higher resistance than g3.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and each contributes a portion to resistance. So, knocking out both would cause a bigger drop in resistance than either alone. That's what the data says.

But how does this tie into the options?

Looking at option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would have a worse phenotype than either alone. So, that fits the g1g3 data. But what about epistasis?

In gene redundancy, the presence of either gene can compensate. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G1 would result in the same phenotype as knocking out both. But in the data, when both are knocked out, it's worse than either. So, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, neither is epistatic to the other. But none of the options say that.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. But G2's knockout is the most severe, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but in this case, we're only looking at resistance.

Wait, but what's the definition of epistasis? It's when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3 depends on G1.

In the data, when G1 is knocked out, G3's presence doesn't matter. So, the resistance is 75% regardless of G3's status. But when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is lower than when G1 is present.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me think about the double mutants.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, the effect isn't masked, so perhaps they're in parallel pathways.

If G2 is the TF, then all the downstream effects depend on G2. So, the presence of G2 is necessary for any resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, perhaps G2's product can initiate a pathway, but both G1 and G3 contribute to the same process. So, without G1 and G3, the process can't proceed as efficiently.

But I'm not entirely certain about the epistatic relationship here.

Looking at the options again, the correct option seems to be D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: which options can be ruled out.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because g2 is 0%, suggesting G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (unlikely in plants), and G3 epistatic to G1.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

But I'm not sure about pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make the phenotype worse than the more severe single mutant. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either. So, that contradicts the idea of redundancy. Because in redundancy, the presence of either gene provides the necessary function. So, if both are knocked out, the phenotype would be the same as the more severe single mutant. But here, g1g3 is worse than either, so perhaps it's not redundancy.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing redundancy with complementary gene action. Redundancy would mean that both genes do the same thing, so losing both doesn't make things worse than losing one. But the data shows that losing both makes it worse. So, perhaps it's not redundancy.

So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (not redundant), and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So, perhaps the correct option is C or D.

Wait, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, the data suggests that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype, which could be because they function in parallel pathways.

But the options don't directly address that. So, perhaps the best fit is option D, considering that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is much lower than the wild type, but higher than zero. So, perhaps G2 is the TF, and when G1 and G3 are present, they contribute to the function. Therefore, without both, the pathway is severely affected.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about which option fits the data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 determines the phenotype regardless of G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, since G1 is knocked out, the effect is determined by G3's status. But since G1 is epistatic, G3's function is masked. But in reality, in g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, with G2 acting upstream. Their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype, meaning that each contributes to the same process but in a way that the loss of both is worse than either alone.

Looking at the options, the only one that says G2 is TF is option C or D.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I can't see how that applies here, as we're only looking at resistance.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as I thought earlier, redundancy would mean that the double mutant isn't worse than the more severe single mutant.

Hmm. Maybe the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. But the data contradicts that because the double mutant is worse than either. So, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the best fit is option D, assuming that the redundancy refers to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the right answer is option A, but I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: look for what each option says about the epistatic relationships.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, the effect of G1 is masked by G2. So, if G2 is present, the effect of G1 doesn't matter.

But in the data, when G2 is present (as in g1g3), the resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant. So, that suggests that G2's presence doesn't mask the effect of G1 and G3.

Alternatively, in the double mutant g1g2, G2 is knocked out. So, G2's presence is required for any resistance.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to pick the best option based on reasoning.

G2 is the transcription factor, which aligns with options C and D.

In the data, the double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either, suggesting that G1 and G3 are additive or in parallel. So, perhaps they are redundant, but not in the classical sense.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as I thought earlier, redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make the resistance worse than the more severe single mutant. But here, it does, so perhaps it's not redundancy.

Wait, maybe gene redundancy is when the two genes can perform the same function, so losing both doesn't change the phenotype beyond losing one. But in our data, losing both makes it worse, so perhaps it's not redundancy.

Hmm, perhaps another term applies. Gene dosage? Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function in a way that their combined loss has a more severe effect. Maybe they are part of the same complex, so both are needed for it to function. So, without either, the complex can't function, leading to lower resistance.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the answer options, the only one that says G2 is the TF and that the other two are in a redundant relationship is option D. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not clear on what 'show pleiotropy' means in this context. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here, G1 and G3 are two different genes affecting the same trait (resistance). So, perhaps that's not the right term.

Wait, perhaps 'show pleiotropy' is a misinterpretation. Maybe it's saying that G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, meaning each affects multiple traits, but that's not relevant here. So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but I'm not entirely confident. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but the double mutant is worse than either, which I'm not sure how to reconcile.

Wait, another angle: the presence of epistasis. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G3 is dependent on G1. So, when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is irrelevant. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, and when G3 is knocked out (g3), it's 50%. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the resistance should be the same when G1 is knocked out regardless of G3's status. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1. So, that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

Hmm. Maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, when G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1's presence is irrelevant. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So, that suggests that G3's effect is more significant, but I'm not sure how that relates to epistasis.

I think I'm going around in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option D as the answer, because G2 is the TF, and the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting their functions are additive, perhaps due to redundancy, even though the data seems conflicting.


The question involves determining the interaction between three genes (G1, G2, and G3) contributing to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer the relationships between these genes, particularly focusing on whether one is a transcription factor (TF) and how they interact.

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (G1 contributes partially to resistance).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (G2 is essential for resistance; likely a transcription factor upstream of other genes).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (G3 contributes less than G1 to resistance).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2's role is critical and masks the contribution of G1).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive or synergistic effects of G1 and G3 in parallel pathways).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2's role is essential and masks the contribution of G3).

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.
- **Ruled out**: The data shows that G2 is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), suggesting G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Additionally, pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits) is not evident here, as the data focuses solely on resistance.

#### **Option B**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.
- **Ruled out**: While G2 is likely the transcription factor, the idea that G1 and G3 share the same promoter (common in prokaryotes but rare in plants) is unlikely. Furthermore, the data does not support G3 being epistatic to G1, as the resistance phenotype of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating additive effects rather than epistasis.

#### **Option C**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
- **Ruled out**: Pleiotropy is not applicable here, as the data focuses on resistance, a single trait. Additionally, the resistance phenotype of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which contradicts the idea of G1 being epistatic to G3. Epistasis would imply that the phenotype of one gene masks the other, which is not observed.

#### **Option D**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.
- **Best fit**: G2 is the transcription factor, as indicated by the 0% resistance in g2. The data supports the idea of gene redundancy, where G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype (10% resistance in g1g3). However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is not fully supported by the data, as the resistance phenotype of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive rather than epistatic effects. Despite this, option D aligns most closely with the observed data compared to the other options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, **option D** is the most consistent with the data, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and accounts for the additive effects of G1 and G3 in the double mutant g1g3. While the claim about epistasis is not fully supported, it is the best fit among the given options.
