Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. So the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The task is to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states.

Wait, what's the key concept here? Oh right, I think this has to do with the uncertainty principle. Like, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. Because if the state doesn't last very long, the energy isn't precisely known, right?

The formula I remember is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But sometimes, I've seen it approximated as ΔE ≈ 1/(Δt), considering the proportionality. So the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state.

Wait, but each state here has its own lifetime. So for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy would be based on their respective lifetimes. But how does that help in determining the energy difference needed for them to be distinguishable?

Ah, I think the point is that for two states to be resolvable, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe each state's uncertainty contributes, so the total uncertainty is the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the smaller uncertainty would require the energy difference to be at least that.

Wait, no, more accurately, the energy resolution depends on the uncertainty in the measurement. So when you have two states, the minimum energy difference that can be distinguished is determined by the uncertainty in the energy measurements. So if each state has a certain uncertainty, the energy difference should be larger than that to be resolved.

Wait, but in this case, the two states have different lifetimes. So each has a different ΔE. Let me think: the first state has lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties?

Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because when you're trying to measure the energy, the uncertainty ΔE is given by the reciprocal of the measurement time. If you're trying to resolve two closely spaced energy levels, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement.

The measurement time would probably be on the order of the lifetimes of the states. Hmm, perhaps the relevant time is the longer of the two lifetimes, because if one state's lifetime is shorter, its uncertainty is higher, so the energy difference needs to be higher than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime?

Wait, no, maybe it's the sum. Because the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of either state. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, let me think in terms of the product. The uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ h/(2π), but in natural units, it's often approximated as ΔE * τ ≈ 1. So maybe the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ 1/(1e-9) = 1e9 eV^-1? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, Planck's constant in eV·s is about h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So the uncertainty relation is ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum ΔE is approximately ħ / (2τ). So for each state, compute their ΔE.

So for state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) ) = approximately 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are 3.291e-7 eV and 3.291e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but when you're trying to measure the energy difference between the two states, the measurement's uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because each state's energy is uncertain, so the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 has an uncertainty of ΔE_total = ΔE2 + ΔE1.

Wait, no, because the uncertainties are independent. So the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the square root of (ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2), assuming they're uncorrelated. But wait, maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties is the main factor.

But let's think about it more simply. To resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy measurements. The uncertainty in energy is determined by the measurement time. If you measure the energy of each state, the time you spend would probably be on the order of their lifetimes. So if you measure state 1, your energy uncertainty is ΔE1, and for state 2, ΔE2.

But when you're looking for the energy difference between the two, perhaps the total uncertainty is the sum of the two individual uncertainties. So if E2 is measured with uncertainty ΔE2 and E1 with ΔE1, then the difference would have uncertainty sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). But wait, no, because the difference is E2 - E1, so the uncertainties add in quadrature.

Wait, actually, the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances, assuming the two are independent. So variance(ΔE) = variance(E2) + variance(E1). So the uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). 

But let me compute that. So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So (ΔE1)^2 = (3.29e-7)^2 = approx 1.08e-13 eV².
(ΔE2)^2 = (3.29e-8)^2 = approx 1.08e-15 eV².

Adding these gives 1.09e-13 eV². The square root is about 3.3e-7 eV. So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, that's about the same as the larger uncertainty (ΔE1 is 3.3e-7, ΔE2 is 3.3e-8). So the uncertainty in the energy difference is dominated by the larger of the two uncertainties.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says we want to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this uncertainty, right? So ΔE = E2 - E1 must be > 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 of 3.3e-7 → way smaller than the uncertainty. Can't distinguish.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 3.3e-7. So yes, that's well above the uncertainty.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is about 3 times smaller than 3.3e-7. So no, because 1e-8 < 3.3e-7 → can't resolve.

So the option that's larger than 3.3e-7 eV is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 τ1) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

For τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the difference in energy must be greater than the sum of their individual ΔE's? Or the larger one?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the energy difference being greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement. If I'm measuring E2 and E1, the total uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps just the larger one.

Wait, but when looking for the energy difference, the uncertainty in each E contributes. So the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the same as the maximum of the two individual uncertainties, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: To resolve two peaks in a spectrum, the resolving power is given by the distance between the peaks divided by the uncertainty of each. The resolving condition is usually delta E > sum of the uncertainties. Or perhaps the sum of the half-widths.

Wait, in spectroscopy, the resolving power R is defined as R = λ/Δλ = (E) / (ΔE), where E is the energy of the spectral line and ΔE is the uncertainty or linewidth.

But for two lines to be resolved, the separation between them should be more than the sum of their half-widths. So the condition is E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So for the two energy levels to be clearly distinguished, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So in our case, E2 - E1 must be > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) = (3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8) = 3.619e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

The other options are all much smaller than this. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me recheck. 1e-4 eV is 100 micro eV. The required minimum is about 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.36 micro eV. So 1e-4 is way larger.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states \( \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar / 2 \). Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. The energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties to ensure they are resolvable.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
The reduced Planck's constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). The energy difference is too small to distinguish the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. The energy difference is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 1000 \times 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than the required minimum energy difference, ensuring the two states can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is slightly smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). The energy difference is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

So for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ 1/(1e-9) = 1e9 eV^-1? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, Planck's constant in eV·s is about h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So the uncertainty relation is ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum ΔE is approximately ħ / (2τ). So for each state, compute their ΔE.

So for state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) ) = approximately 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are 3.291e-7 eV and 3.291e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but when you're trying to measure the energy difference between the two states, the measurement's uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because each state's energy is uncertain, so the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 has an uncertainty of ΔE_total = ΔE2 + ΔE1.

Wait, no, because the uncertainties are independent. So the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the square root of (ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2), assuming they're uncorrelated. But wait, maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties is the main factor.

But let's think about it more simply. To resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy measurements. The uncertainty in energy is determined by the measurement time. If you measure the energy of each state, the time you spend would probably be on the order of their lifetimes. So if you measure state 1, your energy uncertainty is ΔE1, and for state 2, ΔE2.

But when you're looking for the energy difference between the two, perhaps the total uncertainty is the sum of the two individual uncertainties. So if E2 is measured with uncertainty ΔE2 and E1 with ΔE1, then the difference would have uncertainty sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). But wait, no, because the difference is E2 - E1, so the uncertainties add in quadrature.

Wait, actually, the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances, assuming the two are independent. So variance(ΔE) = variance(E2) + variance(E1). So the uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). 

But let me compute that. So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So (ΔE1)^2 = (3.29e-7)^2 = approx 1.08e-13 eV².
(ΔE2)^2 = (3.29e-8)^2 = approx 1.08e-15 eV².

Adding these gives 1.09e-13 eV². The square root is about 3.3e-7 eV. So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, that's about the same as the larger uncertainty (ΔE1 is 3.3e-7, ΔE2 is 3.3e-8). So the uncertainty in the energy difference is dominated by the larger of the two uncertainties.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says we want to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this uncertainty, right? So ΔE = E2 - E1 must be > 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 of 3.3e-7 → way smaller than the uncertainty. Can't distinguish.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 3.3e-7. So yes, that's well above the uncertainty.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is about 3 times smaller than 3.3e-7. So no, because 1e-8 < 3.3e-7 → can't resolve.

So the option that's larger than 3.3e-7 eV is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 τ1) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

For τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the difference in energy must be greater than the sum of their individual ΔE's? Or the larger one?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the energy difference being greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement. If I'm measuring E2 and E1, the total uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps just the larger one.

So for the two energy levels to be clearly distinguished, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So in our case, E2 - E1 must be > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) = (3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8) = 3.619e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

The other options are all much smaller than this. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me recheck. 1e-4 eV is 100 micro eV. The required minimum is about 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.36 micro eV. So 1e-4 is way larger.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states \( \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar / 2 \). Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. The energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties to ensure they are resolvable.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
The reduced Planck's constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). The energy difference is too small to distinguish the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. The energy difference is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 1000 \times 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than the required minimum energy difference, ensuring the two states can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is slightly smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). The energy difference is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
