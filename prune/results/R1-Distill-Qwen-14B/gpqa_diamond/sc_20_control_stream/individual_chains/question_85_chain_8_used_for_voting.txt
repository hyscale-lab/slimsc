Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. There are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think means their reflectivity is the same, so that might not factor into the calculation directly.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but wait, how do I find the distance? The problem gives some information about the Doppler shifts, so I think that relates to the RV method which gives the mass and the distance. Hmm, not entirely sure, maybe I need to derive the period or the distance from that data.

Wait, the problem says both planets induce Doppler shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1's shift is up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2's is 0.04 Å. I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity. So the RV method measures the velocity of the star as it moves due to the planet's orbit.

The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c. So delta lambda is the shift, and velocity is the star's velocity. So for each planet, we can find the velocity by delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. Wait, wait, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03e-10 m (since 1 Å is 1e-10 m). Wait, no, wait, 0.03 Å is 0.03 * 1e-10 m = 3e-12 m. The wavelength is 6300 Å which is 6300e-10 m or 6.3e-7 m.

The Doppler formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. So v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). So for Planet1: v1 = 3e8 m/s * (3e-12 m / 6.3e-7 m). Wait, let me calculate that.

Wait, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m. Lambda is 6300e-10 m. So delta_lambda/lambda = 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 1 / 210,000 ≈ 4.76e-6.

So v1 = c * 4.76e-6. c is about 3e8 m/s, so v1 = 3e8 * 4.76e-6 = approximately 1428 m/s. Wait, that seems high. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.03 / 6300. 0.03 is 3e-2. 6300 is 6.3e3. So 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476 * 1e-5 = 4.76e-6.

So v1 ≈ 3e8 * 4.76e-6 = 3e8 * 4.76e-6. Let me compute that. 3e8 *4.76e-6 = 3 *4.76 * 1e2 = 14.28 *1e2= 1428 m/s. Hmm, that's a pretty high velocity, but maybe that's correct. Similarly for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 Å. So:

v2 = c * (0.04 / 6300) = 3e8 * (0.04 /6300) = 3e8 * (4e-2 / 6.3e3) = 3e8 * (4 / 630 ) * 1e-3 = 3e8 * (0.0063492) ≈ 1899 m/s.

Wait, but wait. The Doppler shift gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbit. The formula I remember is v = (G*M_p / (a*(M_star + M_p))) )^(1/3) * ... wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2πG) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the planet's orbital period and distance. Alternatively, another approach: Since the RV method gives the mass function, but perhaps for this problem, since both planets are detected, their velocities are related to their masses and distances. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but maybe I can find the distance (semi-major axis) of each planet from the star using the RV data. Because the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + m_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Another approach: the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P yr) / (M_star / M_sun) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-2/3) )

But perhaps I can find a simpler way. Alternatively, knowing that the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (a (1 - e²) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π)/(P) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (M_star) )

Wait, I'm not very confident about that. Let me think. Wait, perhaps a better approach is the following: because both planets are detected via RV, their velocity semi-amplitudes (K) are given by the Doppler shifts. So K1 is 0.03 Å and K2 is 0.04 Å? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Doppler shift is the actual velocity of the star. So for Planet1, the star's velocity is up to 0.03 Å shift, which we calculated as ~1428 m/s. Similarly for Planet2, 0.04 Å gives ~1899 m/s.

Wait, no, wait. The velocity semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So K1 is 1428 m/s, and K2 is 1899 m/s.

Wait, but how does K relate to the planet's orbital distance? The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (a (1 - e²) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π)/(P) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (M_star) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me recall that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler formula that relates K, the planet's orbital period (P), and the semi-major axis (a). Oh wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) a³. But if M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

But how does this help with K?

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (G M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ) / (c * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a relation between K and a (semi-major axis).

Wait, another approach: since the problem gives the Doppler shifts, which relate to K, and we can express K in terms of the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. So perhaps I can set up a ratio between the two planets to find the ratio of their distances.

Wait, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (a (M_star)^(1/3)) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π/(P))^(1/3) ) / c

But wait, perhaps it's better to express K as:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

Hmm. Alternatively, I can express a in terms of P using Kepler's third law and then relate K to a.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 for the two planets. Since both have the same star, and same sin i (assuming i is the same, which I think the problem implies), perhaps I can find a ratio of their a's.

Wait, but no, because K depends on both M_p and a. So let's write the equation for K for each planet.

For Planet1:

K1 = (v1) = ( (G * M_p1) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/(P1))^(1/3) ) / c

Similarly, for Planet2:

K2 = (v2) = ( (G * M_p2) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π/(P2))^(1/3) ) / c

But since it's the same star, M_star is the same for both. So let me take the ratio K1 / K2:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )

But wait, from Kepler's third law, the period P is related to a. So P^2 = (4π² G M_star )^(-1) a^3. So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (M_star)^(1/2). So P1/P2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2) * (M_star same) ) ?

Wait, let me think again.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So, P² ∝ a³ / M_star. Since M_star is the same for both planets, P² ∝ a³.

Therefore, P1 / P2 = (a1 / a2 )^(3/2 )

So, substituting back into the K ratio:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

But P2 / P1 = (a2 / a1 )^(3/2 )

So, substituting:

K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 )

Simplify the exponents: (3/2)*(1/3) = 1/2.

So,

K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Hmm, but I'm trying to find a ratio of a1 and a2, but I don't know a1 or a2. But the problem gives K1 and K2. Wait, K1 is the velocity for Planet1 (1428 m/s), K2 is that for Planet2 (1899 m/s). So K1=1428, K2=1899. Let me compute the ratio K1/K2.

K1/K2 ≈ 1428 / 1899 ≈ 0.752.

So,

0.752 = (7/5 )^(1/3) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So M_p1/M_p2=7/5.

Let me compute (7/5)^(1/3). Let's see, 7/5 is 1.4. The cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.12 (since 1.12^3 is about 1.405, which is close enough).

So,

0.752 ≈ 1.12 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.12:

0.752 / 1.12 ≈ sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.752 / 1.12 ≈ 0.671.

Then, square both sides:

a2/a1 ≈ (0.671)^2 ≈ 0.45.

So, a2 ≈ 0.45 a1, which implies that a1 is about twice a2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, a2 is about 0.45 a1, so a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

But wait, I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me double-check:

We have K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2)^(1/3) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

(7/5)^(1/3) is approximately 1.12, as before.

So,

0.752 ≈ 1.12 * (a2/a1 )^(0.5)

Divide 0.752 by 1.12:

≈ 0.752 / 1.12 ≈ 0.671.

So,

sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.671.

Squaring both sides: a2/a1 = ~0.450.

So a1 = a2 / 0.450 ≈ 2.222 a2.

So Planet1 is about 2.22 times farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think if I messed up any exponents.

Wait, in the equation, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, if a2 is smaller than a1 (so a2/a1 <1), then sqrt of that would be less than 1, which would make K1/K2 smaller, which is what we have (K1 is smaller than K2). So yes, that seems correct.

So, a1 is about 2.22 times a2.

Now, the next part: equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, wait, no. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. The equilibrium temperature for a planet is:

T_eq = ( ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π sigma a² ) )^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, and a is the semi-major axis.

Alternatively, since L = 4π R_star² sigma T_star^4, substituting:

T_eq = ( (4 π R_star² sigma T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 π sigma a² ) )^(1/4 )

Simplify the terms:

= ( (4 R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 a² ) )^(1/4 )

= ( ( R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a² ) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star² / (4 a² ) )^(1/4 ) * ( T_star^4 )^(1/4 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * T_star * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Which can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( ( R_star/(2a1) ) / ( R_star/(2a2) ) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because R_star/(2a1) divided by R_star/(2a2) is (a2/a1).

So, T_eq_ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Earlier, we found a2/a1 ≈ 0.45, so:

T_eq_ratio = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.670.

Wait, that's approximately 0.67. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 0.67 times that of Planet2.

Wait, so T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.67.

Looking at the options:

Option C) ~0.53

Option A) ~0.98

Option D) ~1.05

Option B) ~1.30

Wait, 0.67 isn't exactly any of the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the a2/a1 ratio.

Earlier, K1/K2 is approximately 0.752, and (7/5)^(1/3) is approximately 1.12.

So 0.752 = 1.12 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So, sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.752 / 1.12 ≈ 0.671.

Which squares to a2/a1 ≈ 0.671^2 ≈ 0.45.

Wait, that's correct.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

But none of the options match 0.67. Hmm, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for K. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's model the Doppler shift as being due to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P yr) / (M_star / M_sun) ) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, I think that's another version of the formula. So K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3) ) / (M_star)^(1/3)

So, K = (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_jup) * ( (P yr) / (M_star / M_sun) ) )^(-1/3 )

But sin i is taken as 1 (edge-on orbit) for maximum Doppler shift.

So, perhaps I can write K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P1 / P2 )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_star2 / M_star1 ) )^(1/3 )

But in our case, M_star is same for both, so that term is 1.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, P² is proportional to a³ / M_star. Since M_star is same,

P1² / P2² = (a1³ / a2³ )

=> (P1 / P2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2/P1 ) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )

Substituting back,

K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 )

= (M_p1/M_p2 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Which brings us back to the same equation as before. So, same result.

Hmm. So, the ratio of a2/a1 is 0.45, so T_eq ratio is sqrt(0.45)= ~0.67.

But the options don't have 0.67. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.

Wait, let's recalculate K1 and K2. The Doppler shift is given as delta_lambda in Angstroms. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Angstroms. The star's line is at 6300 Angstroms.

The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.

So,

v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )

Where c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

But delta_lambda is 0.03 Angstroms = 0.03e-10 m.

Lambda is 6300 Angstroms = 6300e-10 m.

So,

v1 = 3e8 m/s * (0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m )

= 3e8 * (0.03 / 6300 )

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3 / 6300) * 1e-1 = 0.00047619 * 1e-1 = 4.7619e-5.

So,

v1 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-5 = ?

3e8 *4.7619e-5 = 3 * 4.7619e3 = 14,285.7 m/s.

Wait, that's 14.2857 km/s. That's a very high velocity. That can't be right. Because the star's velocity due to a planet is usually in the m/s range, not km/s. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, 0.03 Angstroms is 0.03e-10 m. 6300 Angstroms is 6300e-10 m.

So the ratio delta_lambda/lambda is 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03/6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3e-5 / 630 = 3/(630 * 1e5) ?

Wait, 0.03/6300 is 0.0000047619, which is 4.7619e-6.

So,

v1 = c * 4.7619e-6 = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 = 3 * 4.7619e2 = 1428.57 m/s.

Ah, okay, that makes more sense. So v1 is about 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 Angstroms.

v2 = 3e8 * (0.04 / 6300 ) = 3e8 * (4e-2 / 6.3e3 ) = 3e8 * (4 / 630 ) * 1e-3 = ?

Wait, 4/630 is approximately 0.006349.

v2 = 3e8 * 0.006349e-3 = 3e8 * 6.349e-6 = 3 * 6.349 * 1e2 = 1904.7 m/s.

So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.7 m/s.

So K1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1904.7 ≈ 0.750.

So, same as before.

So, same as before, K1/K2 ≈ 0.75.

So, the same ratio as before.

Which leads to a2/a1 ≈ 0.45.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

But this isn't one of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Because the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 is larger than a2, T_eq1 is smaller than T_eq2.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.67.

So, the question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1 / T2 = 0.67.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's quite a bit lower than 0.67. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio more accurately. Let's recalculate.

We have K1/K2 = (7/5)^(1/3) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

Compute (7/5)^(1/3) exactly:

7/5 = 1.4.

The cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.119 (since 1.119^3 ≈ 1.4).

So,

0.75 = 1.119 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

=> sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 / 1.119 ≈ 0.671.

Which squared is a2/a1 = 0.450.

So, a1 = a2 / 0.45 ≈ 2.222 a2.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

But none of the options match. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for equilibrium temperature.

Wait, the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But I think I might have missed a factor. Let me recheck.

The correct formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (Lstar/(16 pi sigma a²)) )^(1/4 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me rederive it.

The equilibrium temperature is calculated by setting the power absorbed equal to the power radiated. The absorbed power is (L (1 - A) ) / (4 pi a²), because the star emits L over 4 pi a² area, and the planet reflects A fraction.

The planet radiates as a blackbody: sigma T_eq^4 * 4 pi R_p^2.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is:

( L (1 - A) ) / (4 pi a²) ) = sigma T_eq^4 * 4 pi R_p^2 / (4 )

Wait, because the planet radiates from its entire surface, but the cross-section is pi R_p², so the absorbed is (L (1-A) )/(4 pi a² ) * pi R_p² = L (1-A) R_p²/(4 a² )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look it up mentally.

The correct formula is:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

Because the star's luminosity is spread over a sphere of radius a, so the flux at distance a is L/(4 pi a²). The planet intercepts a cross-sectional area of pi R_p², so the power absorbed is (L/(4 pi a² )) * pi R_p² (1 - A) = L (1 - A) R_p²/(4 a² )

The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4 pi R_p², so the power is 4 pi R_p² sigma T_eq^4.

Setting them equal:

L (1 - A) R_p²/(4 a² ) = 4 pi R_p² sigma T_eq^4.

Simplify:

L (1 - A) / (4 a² ) = 4 pi sigma T_eq^4.

Solve for T_eq:

T_eq^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 pi sigma a² )

T_eq = [ L (1 - A) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ] ^ (1/4 )

But L = 4 pi R_star² sigma T_star^4.

Substituting:

T_eq = [ (4 pi R_star² sigma T_star^4 ) (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (4 pi R_star² sigma T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ (4 R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 a² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ ( R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= ( R_star²/(4 a² ) )^(1/4 ) * ( T_star^4 )^(1/4 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star/(2a) )^(1/2 ) * T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4 )

So the formula is correct as before.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67, which is approximately 0.67.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is C) ~0.53, but that's about 0.53, which is about 0.53, significantly less than 0.67.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial K calculation.

Wait, let me recheck K1 and K2 in more precise terms.

K1 = 0.03 Angstroms shift.

v1 = c * delta_lambda / lambda

c = 3e8 m/s.

delta_lambda = 0.03 Angstrom = 0.03e-10 m.

lambda = 6300 Angstrom = 6300e-10 m.

So,

v1 = 3e8 m/s * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m )

= 3e8 * (0.03 / 6300 ) m/s.

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3/6.3e5) ) = 4.7619e-6.

So,

v1 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 = 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, K2 is 0.04 Angstroms.

v2 = 3e8 * (0.04e-10) / (6300e-10) = 3e8 * 0.04 /6300 = 3e8 * 4e-3 /6300 = 3e8 * (4 /630000) ) = 3e8 * (4 /6.3e5) )= 3e8 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1899.99 m/s.

So K1=1428.57, K2=1900. So K1/K2≈ 0.752.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact ratio of a1 and a2 using the K equation.

We have K1/K2 = (7/5 )^(1/3) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.752 ≈ (1.4 )^(1/3 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Compute 1.4^(1/3) accurately.

The cube of 1.4 is 2.744, so the cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.119.

So,

0.752 = 1.119 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.752 / 1.119 ≈ 0.672.

So,

a2/a1 = (0.672)^2 ≈ 0.4515.

So,

a1 = a2 / 0.4515 ≈ 2.214 a2.

So, a1 is approximately 2.214 times a2.

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/2.214 ) = sqrt(0.4515) ≈ 0.672.

Hmm, so 0.672, which is about 0.67.

But looking again, the options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

None match 0.67. Did I miss a step in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse ratio. Because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 is larger than a2, T_eq1 is smaller than T_eq2. So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is 0.67.

But 0.67 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Let me think: the formula for equilibrium temperature assumes a circular orbit, which the problem states, so that's correct.

Wait, did I forget to account for the star's luminosity or radius in the equilibrium temperature formula? Let me recheck.

The formula includes R_star and T_star, which are given.

Star's T_eff =6300 K, radius 1.2 R_sun.

So, the star is hotter than the Sun (T_sun ~5778 K), but R is 1.2 times the Sun's radius.

But in our calculation of the equilibrium temperature ratio, the R_star and T_star terms cancel out because they are the same for both planets.

So the ratio only depends on a1 and a2.

Wait, unless I messed up the formula for a in terms of K.

Wait, perhaps instead of using the RV semi-amplitude, I should use the transit data to find the planet's radius and hence their distance via the transit method. But the transit method tells us the planet's radius compared to the star, but not the distance. But maybe with the RV data, we can find the distance.

Wait, the transit method gives the planet's radius as R_p = (R_star) * (depth of transit)^(1/2). But without the transit depth, perhaps I can't get R_p from it. So, perhaps the transit method doesn't directly help here.

Wait, but the problem gives masses via RV and radii via transit, I think.

Wait, the problem says: "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods." So, transit gives radius, RV gives mass.

So for each planet, we have mass and radius.

But in the problem, what's needed is the equilibrium temperature, which depends on a, which isn't given. So perhaps the RV data is needed to find a.

So, perhaps I should relate the RV semi-amplitude to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (P ) )^(1/3) ) / c

But assuming e is small (circular orbit, as stated), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

K = ( (2 pi G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But without knowing P or a, I can’t directly compute a. But perhaps if I can relate a1 and a2 using the ratio of K1 and K2.

Alternatively, since both planets are detected, their a can be found using their K values.

Wait, but I already tried that, and I think the a ratio is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the transit method gives the planet's radius, and if I can find the star's luminosity, I can find the equilibrium temperature without knowing a. But no, because equilibrium temperature depends on a, which is unknown.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The Doppler shift is inversely proportional to the distance from the star. No, wait, that's not correct. It's more complicated because it's also dependent on the planet's mass.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the mass-distance relationship.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (v ) ) = ( ( G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) a (1 - e²) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3) )

But since e is zero, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So, P = (4 pi² a³ / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K ≈ [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ) )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute [2 pi / P ]^(1/3 )

P = (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So,

2 pi / P = 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2) )

= 2 pi * (G M_star / (4 pi² a³ ))^(-1/2 )

= 2 pi * ( (G M_star )^(-1/2) (4 pi² a³ )^(1/2) ) )

= 2 pi * ( (G M_star )^(-0.5) ) * (4 pi² )^(0.5) a^(3/2) )

= 2 pi * ( (4 pi² )^(0.5) ) * a^(3/2) ) * (G M_star )^(-0.5 )

Simplify:

4 pi²^(1/2) is 2 pi.

So,

2 pi * 2 pi * a^(3/2) / ( sqrt( G M_star ) )

= 4 pi² a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M_star )

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more carefully. Let me take it slowly.

So,

[ 2 pi / P ] = 2 pi / [ (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2) )

= 2 pi * (G M_star a^-3 )^(1/2) / (4 pi² )^(1/2 )

= 2 pi * sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2) / (2 pi )

Because sqrt(4 pi²) is 2 pi.

So,

[2 pi / P ] = [ 2 pi * sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2) ] / (2 pi )

= sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2 )

So,

[ 2 pi / P ]^(1/3 ) = [ sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2) ]^(1/3 )

= (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Now, substitute back into K:

K ≈ [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/3 ) * (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Simplify exponents.

First, expand each term:

[ (G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/3 ) = G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) a^(-1/3 )

Multiply by (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

So,

G^(1/3) * M_p^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/3) * a^(-1/3 ) * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Combine exponents:

G: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = 1/2.

M_p: 1/3.

M_star: (-1/3 + 1/6 ) = (-2/6 +1/6 )= -1/6.

a: (-1/3 -1/2 ) = (-2/6 -3/6 )= -5/6.

So,

K ≈ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-5/6 )

But G^(1/2) can be written as sqrt(G).

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me see if I can express a in terms of K.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of K1 and K2 can be expressed in terms of a1 and a2.

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ G^(1/2) ( M_p1 )^(1/3) ( M_star )^(-1/6) a1^(-5/6) ) ] / [ G^(1/2) ( M_p2 )^(1/3) ( M_star )^(-1/6) a2^(-5/6) ) ]

Simplify:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(5/6 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(5/6 )

But earlier, we had another equation for K1/K2 involving sqrt(a2/a1 ). I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I can solve for a2/a1.

We have K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(5/6 )

We have K1/K2 ≈ 0.752, M_p1/M_p2=7/5=1.4.

So,

0.752 = (1.4 )^(1/3 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(5/6 )

Compute (1.4 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.119.

So,

0.752 = 1.119 * ( a2/a1 )^(5/6 )

Divide both sides by 1.119:

( a2/a1 )^(5/6 ) ≈ 0.752 / 1.119 ≈ 0.672.

Take both sides to the power of 6/5:

a2/a1 ≈ (0.672 )^(6/5 )

Compute 0.672^(6/5):

0.672^(1.2) ≈ ?

Hmm, 0.672^1 = 0.672.

0.672^0.2: since 0.672 ≈ 0.7^1. So 0.7^0.2 ≈ 0.912.

Wait, perhaps better to compute using logarithms.

ln(0.672) ≈ -0.400.

Multiply by 6/5: -0.400 * 1.2 = -0.48.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.48) ≈ 0.616.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.616.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ 1/0.616 ≈ 1.623.

Wait, this is a different ratio than before. So earlier, using the first approach, we had a2/a1 ≈0.45, but with this more accurate approach, a2/a1≈ 0.616.

Hmm, which is it? I'm getting conflicting results because I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, let me see. The first approach relied on an approximate formula, perhaps missing the correct exponents, whereas this approach uses the more accurate expression, but leads to a different a ratio.

This is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a1 and a2 from the RV data, using the formula:

K = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) a (1 - e^2 ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) )

But without knowing P, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the velocities to the distances using K = (v) = (G M_p )/(a) )^(1/3) * (something).

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a formula that directly relates K, M_p, and a.

Yes, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (P (1 - e²) ) )^(1/3 ) )

But again, without P, it's difficult.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, P² ≈ (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So,

P = (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / ( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the second term:

[ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / ( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 pi * ( G M_star a^-3 )^(1/2) / ( sqrt(4 pi²) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 pi * (G M_star )^(1/2) a^(-3/2) / (2 pi) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (G M_star )^(1/2) a^(-3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Now, substitute back into K:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a ) ]^(1/3) * (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Simplify each part:

First term: [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) a^(-1/3) ]

Second term: G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Multiply them together:

G^(1/3 +1/6) = G^(1/2 )

M_p^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/3 +1/6 ) = M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6 )

a^(-1/3 -1/2 ) = a^(-5/6 )

So,

K = G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-5/6 )

We can express a in terms of K:

a = [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) / K ]^(-6/5 )

= [ ( G^(1/2) ) / K ) * M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) ]^(-6/5 )

= K^(-6/5 ) * G^(-3/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So,

a ∝ K^(-6/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So for each planet, a is proportional to K^(-6/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So for Planet1:

a1 ∝ K1^(-6/5) * M_p1^(-2/5) * M_star^(1/5 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ K2^(-6/5) * M_p2^(-2/5) * M_star^(1/5 )

So, the ratio a1/a2 is:

( K2/K1 )^(6/5) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/5 )

Since M_star is same for both.

So,

a1/a2 = (K2/K1 )^(6/5) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/5 )

We have K1=1428.57, K2=1904.7.

So K2/K1≈ 1904.7/1428.57 ≈ 1.333.

So,

(1.333 )^(6/5 ) ≈ let me compute that. 6/5 is 1.2.

Calculate 1.333^1.2.

We know that 1.333^1=1.333.

1.333^0.2: let's approximate.

Take natural log of 1.333: ln(1.333)≈0.28768.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.057536.

Exponentiate: e^0.057536≈1.059.

So,

1.333^1.2 ≈ 1.333 * 1.059 ≈ 1.411.

Next, ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/5 ) = (5/7 )^(2/5 )

5/7≈0.7143.

Compute 0.7143^(2/5).

Let me compute ln(0.7143)≈-0.3365.

Multiply by 2/5: -0.1346.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.1346)≈0.873.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ 1.411 * 0.873 ≈ 1.23.

So, a1 = 1.23 a2.

So, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is about 1.23 times that of Planet2.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/1.23 ) ≈ sqrt(0.813) ≈ 0.902.

Hmm, about 0.90, which is close to option A) ~0.98, but not exactly. But wait, perhaps my approximations are a bit off.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

First, K2/K1 = 1904.7 / 1428.57 ≈1.333333.

(1.333333)^(6/5) = e^( (6/5) * ln(1.333333) )

ln(1.333333)=0.28768207.

(6/5)*0.28768207=0.3452185.

e^0.3452185≈1.412.

(5/7 )^(2/5 )

5/7 ≈0.714286.

ln(0.714286)=−0.33647.

(2/5)*(-0.33647)=−0.134588.

e^(-0.134588)=≈0.8735.

So,

a1/a2≈1.412 * 0.8735≈1.233.

a2/a1≈1/1.233≈0.811.

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(0.811 )≈0.90.

So, about 0.90, which is closer to option A) ~0.98, but not exactly.

Hmm, but in the options, A is ~0.98, which is higher than 0.90.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio more accurately.

Let me compute (1.3333 )^(6/5 ) more accurately.

6/5 =1.2.

Using logarithms:

ln(1.3333)=0.28768207.

Multiply by 1.2: 0.28768207 *1.2=0.34521848.

e^0.34521848= e^0.34521848.

e^0.345218≈ 1.412 (since e^0.345≈1.412).

Now, (5/7 )^(2/5 ) = (0.7142857 )^(0.4 )

Compute ln(0.7142857)= -0.3364722.

Multiply by 0.4: -0.1345889.

e^(-0.1345889)= approx 0.8735.

So,

a1/a2=1.412 *0.8735≈1.233.

So, a1=1.233 a2.

So, a2/a1=0.8106.

T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.8106 )=0.90.

Hmm, which is about 0.90, but none of the options are exactly 0.90.

Looking at the options, the closest is A) ~0.98, which is about 0.98, but that's higher than 0.90.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me try using the exact formula for a in terms of K.

We have a = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( K ( M_star )^(1/3) ) )^(6/5 )

Wait, perhaps I should write the expressions correctly.

Wait, earlier, we found that a ∝ K^(-6/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So,

a1 / a2 = [ ( K2 / K1 )^6 * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^2 * ( M_star1 / M_star2 ) ]^(1/5 )

But since M_star1 = M_star2, that term is 1.

So,

a1/a2= [ (K2/K1 )^6 * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^2 ]^(1/5 )

= ( ( (K2/K1 )^3 )^2 * ( (M_p2/M_p1 ) )^2 )^(1/5 )

= [ ( (K2/K1 * M_p2/M_p1 )^2 ) ]^(1/5 )

= ( K2/K1 * M_p2/M_p1 )^(2/5 )

Wait, perhaps that's a better way.

So,

a1/a2= ( (K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

Substituting the values:

K2=1904.7, M_p2=5;

K1=1428.57, M_p1=7.

So,

( (1904.7 *5 ) / (1428.57 *7 ) ) = (9523.5 ) / (9999.99 )= approx 0.95235.

So,

a1/a2= (0.95235 )^(2/5 )

Compute ln(0.95235 )= -0.04879.

Multiply by 2/5: -0.019516.

e^(-0.019516 )= approx 0.9808.

So,

a1/a2≈0.9808.

So, a1=0.9808 a2.

Wait, that's a different result! So, a1/a2≈0.9808, meaning a1 is slightly smaller than a2? That contradicts earlier findings.

Wait, no, because according to this, a1 is 0.98 times a2, which means a1 is closer to the star than a2. But earlier, from K1 and K2, higher K would imply closer planet.

Wait, but K is higher for Planet2 (K2=1904.7 > K1=1428.57), which would imply a closer orbit because K is inversely related to a (from K ∝ a^(-5/6 ) ).

Wait, perhaps this is correct.

So, with a1/a2=0.9808, that means a2= a1 /0.9808≈1.0195 a1.

So, Planet2 is slightly farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, but its K is higher, which fits with that because K is inversely proportional to a. So, higher K for Planet2 would imply closer a? Or farther?

Wait, no, if a is smaller (closer), then K is higher, as K ∝ a^(-5/6 ), which is approximately a^(-0.833 ). So, as a decreases, K increases.

So, since K2>K1, a2<a1, so Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Which makes sense. So, a2 = a1 *0.9808.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong.

Wait, a1/a2=0.9808, so a1=0.9808 a2. So a2= a1 /0.9808≈1.0195 a1.

So, a2 is about 1.95% larger than a1, meaning Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, that seems correct because Planet2 has a higher K, so it's closer. But according to this, a2 is larger than a1, which would mean Planet2 is farther, which contradicts the idea that higher K implies closer planet.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the ratio a1/a2.

We have:

a1/a2= ( (K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

K2=1904.7, M_p2=5.

K1=1428.57, M_p1=7.

So,

(K2 * M_p2 )/( K1 * M_p1 )= (1904.7 *5 ) / (1428.57 *7 ) = (9523.5 ) / (9999.99 )= ~0.95235.

So,

a1/a2= (0.95235 )^(2/5 )

Compute ln(0.95235 )= ln(1 -0.04765 )≈ -0.04765 - (0.04765^2)/2 - ... ≈ -0.04765 - 0.00114 ≈ -0.04879.

Multiply by 2/5: -0.04879 * 0.4= -0.019516.

e^(-0.019516 )= approx 0.9808.

So, a1/a2≈0.9808, so a1=0.9808 a2.

Which means a2= a1 / 0.9808≈ a1 * 1.0195.

So, a2 is about 1.95% larger than a1, meaning Planet2 is farther from the star.

But earlier, from K1 and K2, we thought Planet1 was farther, but that's not correct.

Wait, a higher K implies a smaller a. Because K ∝ a^(-5/6 ), so if a is smaller, K is larger.

So, since K2>K1, a2<a1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

But according to this calculation, a2 is larger than a1 (a2=1.0195 a1 ), which implies that Planet2 is farther, which would contradict the higher K. So this must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a1/a2.

Wait, the formula I used was:

a1/a2= ( ( K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

But perhaps I should have a2/a1= ( ( K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

Wait, no, no. Let me rederive.

We have a ∝ K^(-6/5 ) M_p^(-2/5 ) M_star^(1/5 )

So,

a1/a2= [ ( K2 / K1 )^6 ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^2 ( M_star1 / M_star2 ) ]^(1/5 )

Since M_star1 = M_star2, it's 1.

So,

a1/a2= [ ( K2^6 M_p2^2 ) / ( K1^6 M_p1^2 ) ) ]^(1/5 )

= [ ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^6 ]^(1/5 )

= ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^(6/5 )

Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.

So, the correct formula is:

a1/a2= ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^(6/5 )

Earlier, I used 2/5, which was incorrect.

So, let's recalculate.

( K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 )= (1904.7 *5 )/(1428.57 *7 )= (9523.5 )/(9999.99 )= ~0.95235.

So,

a1/a2= (0.95235 )^(6/5 )

Compute ln(0.95235 )= -0.04879.

Multiply by 6/5=1.2: -0.04879 *1.2 = -0.05855.

e^(-0.05855 )≈0.943.

So,

a1/a2≈0.943.

So, a2= a1 /0.943≈1.061 a1.

So, Planet2's semi-major axis is about 6.1% larger than Planet1's.

Which means Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1.061 )≈1.03.

Which is approximately 1.03, so the ratio is about 1.03, which would be closest to option D) ~1.05.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

So, 1.03 is very close to option D) ~1.05.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.03, which is approximately 1.05.

Wait, but why earlier approaches gave different results. I think the main mistake was in the exponent when deriving a1/a2.

So, the correct approach is to use a1/a2= ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^(6/5 ).

Which gives a1/a2≈0.943, so a2/a1≈1.061.

Thus, T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1.061 )≈1.03, which rounds to ~1.05, option D.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident due to the multiple approaches and possible calculation errors. But considering the accurate method, the correct ratio is closest to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant formulas. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating RV semi-amplitudes to semi-major axes
The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), semi-major axis \(a\), and the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{5/6}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their semi-major axes can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{K_2 \cdot M_{p,2}}{K_1 \cdot M_{p,1}}\right)^{6/5}
\]

Given:
- \(K_1 = 1428.57 \, \text{m/s}\), \(K_2 = 1904.7 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(M_{p,1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_{p,2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1904.7 \cdot 5}{1428.57 \cdot 7}\right)^{6/5}
\]

First, compute the ratio:

\[
\frac{K_2 \cdot M_{p,2}}{K_1 \cdot M_{p,1}} = \frac{1904.7 \cdot 5}{1428.57 \cdot 7} = \frac{9523.5}{9999.99} \approx 0.95235
\]

Now raise this to the power \(6/5\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = (0.95235)^{6/5}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(0.95235) \approx -0.04879
\]

Multiply by \(6/5\):

\[
\ln\left((0.95235)^{6/5}\right) = -0.04879 \cdot \frac{6}{5} = -0.05855
\]

Exponentiate:

\[
(0.95235)^{6/5} \approx e^{-0.05855} \approx 0.943
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.943 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.943} \approx 1.061
\]

### Step 2: Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{1.061}
\]

Calculate the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1.061} \approx 1.03
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated ratio \(T_{\text{eq,1}} / T_{\text{eq,2}} \approx 1.03\) is closest to option D (\( \sim 1.05 \)).

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. There are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think means their reflectivity is the same, so that might not factor into the calculation directly.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but wait, how do I find the distance? The problem gives some information about the Doppler shifts, so I think that relates to the RV method which gives the mass and the distance. Hmm, not entirely sure, maybe I need to derive the period or the distance from that data.

Wait, the problem says both planets induce Doppler shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1's shift is up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2's is 0.04 Å. I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity. So the RV method measures the velocity of the star as it moves due to the planet's orbit.

The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c. So delta lambda is the shift, and velocity is the star's velocity. So for each planet, we can find the velocity by delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. Wait, wait, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03e-10 m (since 1 Å is 1e-10 m). Wait, no, wait, 0.03 Å is 0.03 * 1e-10 m = 3e-12 m. The wavelength is 6300 Å which is 6300e-10 m or 6.3e-7 m.

The Doppler formula is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. So v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). So for Planet1: v1 = 3e8 m/s * (3e-12 m / 6.3e-7 m). Wait, let me calculate that.

Wait, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m. Lambda is 6300e-10 m. So delta_lambda/lambda = 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 1 / 210,000 ≈ 4.76e-6.

So v1 = c * 4.76e-6. c is about 3e8 m/s, so v1 = 3e8 * 4.76e-6 = approximately 1428 m/s. Wait, that seems high. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.03 / 6300. 0.03 is 3e-2. 6300 is 6.3e3. So 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476 * 1e-5 = 4.76e-6.

So v1 ≈ 3e8 * 4.76e-6 = 3e8 * 4.76e-6. Let me compute that. 3e8 *4.76e-6 = 3 *4.76 * 1e2 = 14.28 *1e2= 1428 m/s. Hmm, that's a pretty high velocity, but maybe that's correct. Similarly for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 Å. So:

v2 = c * (0.04 / 6300) = 3e8 * (0.04 /6300) = 3e8 * (4e-2 / 6.3e3) = 3e8 * (4 / 630 ) * 1e-3 = 3e8 * (0.0063492) ≈ 1899 m/s.

Wait, but wait. The Doppler shift gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbit. The formula I remember is v = (G*M_p / (a*(M_star + M_p))) )^(1/3) * ... wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2πG) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the planet's orbital period and distance. Alternatively, another approach: Since the RV method gives the mass function, but perhaps for this problem, since both planets are detected, their velocities are related to their masses and distances. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but maybe I can find the distance (semi-major axis) of each planet from the star using the RV data. Because the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + m_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Another approach: the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P yr) / (M_star / M_sun) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-2/3) )

But perhaps I can find a simpler way. Alternatively, knowing that the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (a (1 - e²) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π)/(P) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (M_star) )

Wait, I'm not very confident about that. Let me think. Wait, perhaps a better approach is the following: because both planets are detected via RV, their velocity semi-amplitudes (K) are given by the Doppler shifts. So K1 is 0.03 Å and K2 is 0.04 Å? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Doppler shift is the actual velocity of the star. So for Planet1, the star's velocity is up to 0.03 Å shift, which we calculated as ~1428 m/s. Similarly for Planet2, 0.04 Å gives ~1899 m/s.

Wait, no, wait. The velocity semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So K1 is 1428 m/s, and K2 is 1899 m/s.

Wait, but how does K relate to the planet's orbital distance? The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (a (1 - e²) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π)/(P) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (M_star) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me recall that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler formula that relates K, the planet's orbital period (P), and the semi-major axis (a). Oh wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) a³. But if M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

But how does this help with K?

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (G M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ) / (c * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a relation between K and a (semi-major axis).

Wait, another approach: since the problem gives the Doppler shifts, which relate to K, and we can express K in terms of the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. So perhaps I can set up a ratio between the two planets to find the ratio of their distances.

Wait, for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (a (M_star)^(1/3)) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π/(P))^(1/3) ) / c

But wait, perhaps it's better to express K as:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

Hmm. Alternatively, I can express a in terms of P using Kepler's third law and then relate K to a.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 for the two planets. Since both have the same star, and same sin i (assuming i is the same, which I think the problem implies), perhaps I can find a ratio of their a's.

Wait, but no, because K depends on both M_p and a. So let's write the equation for K for each planet.

For Planet1:

K1 = (v1) = ( (G * M_p1) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/(P1))^(1/3) ) / c

Similarly, for Planet2:

K2 = (v2) = ( (G * M_p2) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π/(P2))^(1/3) ) / c

But since it's the same star, M_star is the same for both. So let me take the ratio K1 / K2:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )

But wait, from Kepler's third law, the period P is related to a. So P^2 = (4π² G M_star )^(-1) a^3. So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (M_star)^(1/2). So P1/P2 = (a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2) * (M_star same) ) ?

Wait, let me think again.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So, P² ∝ a³ / M_star. Since M_star is the same for both planets, P² ∝ a³.

Therefore, P1 / P2 = (a1 / a2 )^(3/2 )

So, substituting back into the K ratio:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

But P2 / P1 = (a2 / a1 )^(3/2 )

So, substituting:

K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 )

Simplify the exponents: (3/2)*(1/3) = 1/2.

So,

K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Hmm, but I'm trying to find a ratio of a1 and a2, but I don't know a1 or a2. But the problem gives K1 and K2. Wait, K1 is the velocity for Planet1 (1428 m/s), K2 is that for Planet2 (1899 m/s). So K1=1428, K2=1899. Let me compute the ratio K1/K2.

K1/K2 ≈ 1428 / 1899 ≈ 0.752.

So,

0.752 = (7/5 )^(1/3) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So M_p1/M_p2=7/5.

Let me compute (7/5)^(1/3). Let's see, 7/5 is 1.4. The cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.12 (since 1.12^3 is about 1.405, which is close enough).

So,

0.752 ≈ 1.12 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.12:

0.752 / 1.12 ≈ sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.752 / 1.12 ≈ 0.671.

Then, square both sides:

a2/a1 ≈ (0.671)^2 ≈ 0.45.

So, a2 ≈ 0.45 a1, which implies that a1 is about twice a2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, a2 is about 0.45 a1, so a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

But wait, I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me double-check:

We have K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2)^(1/3) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

(7/5)^(1/3) is approximately 1.12, as before.

So,

0.752 ≈ 1.12 * (a2/a1 )^(0.5)

Divide 0.752 by 1.12:

≈ 0.752 / 1.12 ≈ 0.671.

So,

sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.671.

Squaring both sides: a2/a1 = ~0.450.

So a1 = a2 / 0.450 ≈ 2.222 a2.

So Planet1 is about 2.22 times farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think if I messed up any exponents.

Wait, in the equation, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, if a2 is smaller than a1 (so a2/a1 <1), then sqrt of that would be less than 1, which would make K1/K2 smaller, which is what we have (K1 is smaller than K2). So yes, that seems correct.

So, a1 is about 2.22 times a2.

Now, the next part: equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, wait, no. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. The equilibrium temperature for a planet is:

T_eq = ( ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π sigma a² ) )^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, and a is the semi-major axis.

Alternatively, since L = 4π R_star² sigma T_star^4, substituting:

T_eq = ( (4 π R_star² sigma T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 π sigma a² ) )^(1/4 )

Simplify the terms:

= ( (4 R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 a² ) )^(1/4 )

= ( ( R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a² ) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star² / (4 a² ) )^(1/4 ) * ( T_star^4 )^(1/4 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * T_star * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Which can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( ( R_star/(2a1) ) / ( R_star/(2a2) ) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because R_star/(2a1) divided by R_star/(2a2) is (a2/a1).

So, T_eq_ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Earlier, we found a2/a1 ≈ 0.45, so:

T_eq_ratio = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.670.

Wait, that's approximately 0.67. So Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 0.67 times that of Planet2.

Wait, so T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.67.

Looking at the options:

Option C) ~0.53

Option A) ~0.98

Option D) ~1.05

Option B) ~1.30

Wait, 0.67 isn't exactly any of the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the a2/a1 ratio.

Earlier, K1/K2 is approximately 0.752, and (7/5)^(1/3) is approximately 1.12.

So 0.752 = 1.12 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So, sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.752 / 1.12 ≈ 0.671.

Which squares to a2/a1 ≈ 0.671^2 ≈ 0.45.

Wait, that's correct.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

But none of the options match 0.67. Hmm, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for K. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's model the Doppler shift as being due to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P yr) / (M_star / M_sun) ) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, I think that's another version of the formula. So K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3) ) / (M_star)^(1/3)

So, K = (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_jup) * ( (P yr) / (M_star / M_sun) ) )^(-1/3 )

But sin i is taken as 1 (edge-on orbit) for maximum Doppler shift.

So, perhaps I can write K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P1 / P2 )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_star2 / M_star1 ) )^(1/3 )

But in our case, M_star is same for both, so that term is 1.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's law, P² is proportional to a³ / M_star. Since M_star is same,

P1² / P2² = (a1³ / a2³ )

=> (P1 / P2 ) = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2/P1 ) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )

Substituting back,

K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3 )

= (M_p1/M_p2 ) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

Which brings us back to the same equation as before. So, same result.

Hmm. So, the ratio of a2/a1 is 0.45, so T_eq ratio is sqrt(0.45)= ~0.67.

But the options don't have 0.67. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.

Wait, let's recalculate K1 and K2. The Doppler shift is given as delta_lambda in Angstroms. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Angstroms. The star's line is at 6300 Angstroms.

The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.

So,

v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )

Where c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

But delta_lambda is 0.03 Angstroms = 0.03e-10 m.

Lambda is 6300 Angstroms = 6300e-10 m.

So,

v1 = 3e8 m/s * (0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m )

= 3e8 * (0.03 / 6300 )

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3 / 6300) * 1e-1 = 0.00047619 * 1e-1 = 4.7619e-5.

So,

v1 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-5 = ?

3e8 *4.7619e-5 = 3 * 4.7619e3 = 14,285.7 m/s.

Wait, that's 14.2857 km/s. That's a very high velocity. That can't be right. Because the star's velocity due to a planet is usually in the m/s range, not km/s. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, 0.03 Angstroms is 0.03e-10 m. 6300 Angstroms is 6300e-10 m.

So the ratio delta_lambda/lambda is 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03/6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3e-5 / 630 = 3/(630 * 1e5) ?

Wait, 0.03/6300 is 0.0000047619, which is 4.7619e-6.

So,

v1 = c * 4.7619e-6 = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 = 3 * 4.7619e2 = 1428.57 m/s.

Ah, okay, that makes more sense. So v1 is about 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04 Angstroms.

v2 = 3e8 * (0.04 / 6300 ) = 3e8 * (4e-2 / 6.3e3 ) = 3e8 * (4 / 630 ) * 1e-3 = ?

Wait, 4/630 is approximately 0.006349.

v2 = 3e8 * 0.006349e-3 = 3e8 * 6.349e-6 = 3 * 6.349 * 1e2 = 1904.7 m/s.

So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.7 m/s.

So K1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1904.7 ≈ 0.750.

So, same as before.

So, same as before, K1/K2 ≈ 0.75.

So, the same ratio as before.

Which leads to a2/a1 ≈ 0.45.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

But this isn't one of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Because the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 is larger than a2, T_eq1 is smaller than T_eq2.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.67.

So, the question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1 / T2 = 0.67.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's quite a bit lower than 0.67. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio more accurately. Let's recalculate.

We have K1/K2 = (7/5)^(1/3) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

Compute (7/5)^(1/3) exactly:

7/5 = 1.4.

The cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.119 (since 1.119^3 ≈ 1.4).

So,

0.75 = 1.119 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

=> sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 / 1.119 ≈ 0.671.

Which squared is a2/a1 = 0.450.

So, a1 = a2 / 0.45 ≈ 2.222 a2.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

But none of the options match. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for equilibrium temperature.

Wait, the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But I think I might have missed a factor. Let me recheck.

The correct formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (Lstar/(16 pi sigma a²)) )^(1/4 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me rederive it.

The equilibrium temperature is calculated by setting the power absorbed equal to the power radiated. The absorbed power is (L (1 - A) ) / (4 pi a²), because the star emits L over 4 pi a² area, and the planet reflects A fraction.

The planet radiates as a blackbody: sigma T_eq^4 * 4 pi R_p^2.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is:

( L (1 - A) ) / (4 pi a²) ) = sigma T_eq^4 * 4 pi R_p^2 / (4 )

Wait, because the planet radiates from its entire surface, but the cross-section is pi R_p², so the absorbed is (L (1-A) )/(4 pi a² ) * pi R_p² = L (1-A) R_p²/(4 a² )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look it up mentally.

The correct formula is:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

Because the star's luminosity is spread over a sphere of radius a, so the flux at distance a is L/(4 pi a²). The planet intercepts a cross-sectional area of pi R_p², so the power absorbed is (L/(4 pi a² )) * pi R_p² (1 - A) = L (1 - A) R_p²/(4 a² )

The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4 pi R_p², so the power is 4 pi R_p² sigma T_eq^4.

Setting them equal:

L (1 - A) R_p²/(4 a² ) = 4 pi R_p² sigma T_eq^4.

Simplify:

L (1 - A) / (4 a² ) = 4 pi sigma T_eq^4.

Solve for T_eq:

T_eq^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 pi sigma a² )

T_eq = [ L (1 - A) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ] ^ (1/4 )

But L = 4 pi R_star² sigma T_star^4.

Substituting:

T_eq = [ (4 pi R_star² sigma T_star^4 ) (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (4 pi R_star² sigma T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ (4 R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 a² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ ( R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) ) / (4 a² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

= ( R_star²/(4 a² ) )^(1/4 ) * ( T_star^4 )^(1/4 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

= ( R_star/(2a) )^(1/2 ) * T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4 )

So the formula is correct as before.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67, which is approximately 0.67.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is C) ~0.53, but that's about 0.53, which is about 0.53, significantly less than 0.67.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial K calculation.

Wait, let me recheck K1 and K2 in more precise terms.

K1 = 0.03 Angstroms shift.

v1 = c * delta_lambda / lambda

c = 3e8 m/s.

delta_lambda = 0.03 Angstrom = 0.03e-10 m.

lambda = 6300 Angstrom = 6300e-10 m.

So,

v1 = 3e8 m/s * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m )

= 3e8 * (0.03 / 6300 ) m/s.

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3/6.3e5) ) = 4.7619e-6.

So,

v1 = 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 = 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, K2 is 0.04 Angstroms.

v2 = 3e8 * (0.04e-10) / (6300e-10) = 3e8 * 0.04 /6300 = 3e8 * 4e-3 /6300 = 3e8 * (4 /630000) ) = 3e8 * (4 /6.3e5) )= 3e8 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1899.99 m/s.

So K1=1428.57, K2=1900. So K1/K2≈ 0.752.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact ratio of a1 and a2 using the K equation.

We have K1/K2 = (7/5 )^(1/3) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.752 ≈ (1.4 )^(1/3 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Compute 1.4^(1/3) accurately.

The cube of 1.4 is 2.744, so the cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.119.

So,

0.752 = 1.119 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.752 / 1.119 ≈ 0.672.

So,

a2/a1 = (0.672)^2 ≈ 0.4515.

So,

a1 = a2 / 0.4515 ≈ 2.214 a2.

So, a1 is approximately 2.214 times a2.

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/2.214 ) = sqrt(0.4515) ≈ 0.672.

Hmm, so 0.672, which is about 0.67.

But looking again, the options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

None match 0.67. Did I miss a step in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse ratio. Because T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if a1 is larger than a2, T_eq1 is smaller than T_eq2. So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is 0.67.

But 0.67 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Let me think: the formula for equilibrium temperature assumes a circular orbit, which the problem states, so that's correct.

Wait, did I forget to account for the star's luminosity or radius in the equilibrium temperature formula? Let me recheck.

The formula includes R_star and T_star, which are given.

Star's T_eff =6300 K, radius 1.2 R_sun.

So, the star is hotter than the Sun (T_sun ~5778 K), but R is 1.2 times the Sun's radius.

But in our calculation of the equilibrium temperature ratio, the R_star and T_star terms cancel out because they are the same for both planets.

So the ratio only depends on a1 and a2.

Wait, unless I messed up the formula for a in terms of K.

Wait, perhaps instead of using the RV semi-amplitude, I should use the transit data to find the planet's radius and hence their distance via the transit method. But the transit method tells us the planet's radius compared to the star, but not the distance. But maybe with the RV data, we can find the distance.

Wait, the transit method gives the planet's radius as R_p = (R_star) * (depth of transit)^(1/2). But without the transit depth, perhaps I can't get R_p from it. So, perhaps the transit method doesn't directly help here.

Wait, but the problem gives masses via RV and radii via transit, I think.

Wait, the problem says: "Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods." So, transit gives radius, RV gives mass.

So for each planet, we have mass and radius.

But in the problem, what's needed is the equilibrium temperature, which depends on a, which isn't given. So perhaps the RV data is needed to find a.

So, perhaps I should relate the RV semi-amplitude to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (P ) )^(1/3) ) / c

But assuming e is small (circular orbit, as stated), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

K = ( (2 pi G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But without knowing P or a, I can’t directly compute a. But perhaps if I can relate a1 and a2 using the ratio of K1 and K2.

Alternatively, since both planets are detected, their a can be found using their K values.

Wait, but I already tried that, and I think the a ratio is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the transit method gives the planet's radius, and if I can find the star's luminosity, I can find the equilibrium temperature without knowing a. But no, because equilibrium temperature depends on a, which is unknown.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The Doppler shift is inversely proportional to the distance from the star. No, wait, that's not correct. It's more complicated because it's also dependent on the planet's mass.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the mass-distance relationship.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (v ) ) = ( ( G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) a (1 - e²) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3) )

But since e is zero, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So, P = (4 pi² a³ / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K ≈ [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ) )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute [2 pi / P ]^(1/3 )

P = (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So,

2 pi / P = 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2) )

= 2 pi * (G M_star / (4 pi² a³ ))^(-1/2 )

= 2 pi * ( (G M_star )^(-1/2) (4 pi² a³ )^(1/2) ) )

= 2 pi * ( (G M_star )^(-0.5) ) * (4 pi² )^(0.5) a^(3/2) )

= 2 pi * ( (4 pi² )^(0.5) ) * a^(3/2) ) * (G M_star )^(-0.5 )

Simplify:

4 pi²^(1/2) is 2 pi.

So,

2 pi * 2 pi * a^(3/2) / ( sqrt( G M_star ) )

= 4 pi² a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M_star )

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more carefully. Let me take it slowly.

So,

[ 2 pi / P ] = 2 pi / [ (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2) )

= 2 pi * (G M_star a^-3 )^(1/2) / (4 pi² )^(1/2 )

= 2 pi * sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2) / (2 pi )

Because sqrt(4 pi²) is 2 pi.

So,

[2 pi / P ] = [ 2 pi * sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2) ] / (2 pi )

= sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2 )

So,

[ 2 pi / P ]^(1/3 ) = [ sqrt( G M_star ) a^(-3/2) ]^(1/3 )

= (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Now, substitute back into K:

K ≈ [ (G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/3 ) * (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Simplify exponents.

First, expand each term:

[ (G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/3 ) = G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) a^(-1/3 )

Multiply by (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

So,

G^(1/3) * M_p^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/3) * a^(-1/3 ) * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Combine exponents:

G: (1/3 + 1/6 ) = 1/2.

M_p: 1/3.

M_star: (-1/3 + 1/6 ) = (-2/6 +1/6 )= -1/6.

a: (-1/3 -1/2 ) = (-2/6 -3/6 )= -5/6.

So,

K ≈ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-5/6 )

But G^(1/2) can be written as sqrt(G).

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me see if I can express a in terms of K.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of K1 and K2 can be expressed in terms of a1 and a2.

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ G^(1/2) ( M_p1 )^(1/3) ( M_star )^(-1/6) a1^(-5/6) ) ] / [ G^(1/2) ( M_p2 )^(1/3) ( M_star )^(-1/6) a2^(-5/6) ) ]

Simplify:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(5/6 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(5/6 )

But earlier, we had another equation for K1/K2 involving sqrt(a2/a1 ). I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I can solve for a2/a1.

We have K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) * ( a2 / a1 )^(5/6 )

We have K1/K2 ≈ 0.752, M_p1/M_p2=7/5=1.4.

So,

0.752 = (1.4 )^(1/3 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(5/6 )

Compute (1.4 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.119.

So,

0.752 = 1.119 * ( a2/a1 )^(5/6 )

Divide both sides by 1.119:

( a2/a1 )^(5/6 ) ≈ 0.752 / 1.119 ≈ 0.672.

Take both sides to the power of 6/5:

a2/a1 ≈ (0.672 )^(6/5 )

Compute 0.672^(6/5):

0.672^(1.2) ≈ ?

Hmm, 0.672^1 = 0.672.

0.672^0.2: since 0.672 ≈ 0.7^1. So 0.7^0.2 ≈ 0.912.

Wait, perhaps better to compute using logarithms.

ln(0.672) ≈ -0.400.

Multiply by 6/5: -0.400 * 1.2 = -0.48.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.48) ≈ 0.616.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.616.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ 1/0.616 ≈ 1.623.

Wait, this is a different ratio than before. So earlier, using the first approach, we had a2/a1 ≈0.45, but with this more accurate approach, a2/a1≈ 0.616.

Hmm, which is it? I'm getting conflicting results because I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, let me see. The first approach relied on an approximate formula, perhaps missing the correct exponents, whereas this approach uses the more accurate expression, but leads to a different a ratio.

This is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a1 and a2 from the RV data, using the formula:

K = (v ) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) a (1 - e^2 ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) )

But without knowing P, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the velocities to the distances using K = (v) = (G M_p )/(a) )^(1/3) * (something).

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a formula that directly relates K, M_p, and a.

Yes, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (P (1 - e²) ) )^(1/3 ) )

But again, without P, it's difficult.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G (M_star + M_p ) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, P² ≈ (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So,

P = (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a ) ]^(1/3) * [ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / ( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the second term:

[ 2 pi / ( (4 pi² a³ / ( G M_star ))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 pi * ( G M_star a^-3 )^(1/2) / ( sqrt(4 pi²) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 pi * (G M_star )^(1/2) a^(-3/2) / (2 pi) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (G M_star )^(1/2) a^(-3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Now, substitute back into K:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) a ) ]^(1/3) * (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Simplify each part:

First term: [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) a^(-1/3) ]

Second term: G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Multiply them together:

G^(1/3 +1/6) = G^(1/2 )

M_p^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/3 +1/6 ) = M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6 )

a^(-1/3 -1/2 ) = a^(-5/6 )

So,

K = G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) a^(-5/6 )

We can express a in terms of K:

a = [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) / K ]^(-6/5 )

= [ ( G^(1/2) ) / K ) * M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) ]^(-6/5 )

= K^(-6/5 ) * G^(-3/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So,

a ∝ K^(-6/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So for each planet, a is proportional to K^(-6/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So for Planet1:

a1 ∝ K1^(-6/5) * M_p1^(-2/5) * M_star^(1/5 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ K2^(-6/5) * M_p2^(-2/5) * M_star^(1/5 )

So, the ratio a1/a2 is:

( K2/K1 )^(6/5) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/5 )

Since M_star is same for both.

So,

a1/a2 = (K2/K1 )^(6/5) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/5 )

We have K1=1428.57, K2=1904.7.

So K2/K1≈ 1904.7/1428.57 ≈ 1.333.

So,

(1.333 )^(6/5 ) ≈ let me compute that. 6/5 is 1.2.

Calculate 1.333^1.2.

We know that 1.333^1=1.333.

1.333^0.2: let's approximate.

Take natural log of 1.333: ln(1.333)≈0.28768.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.057536.

Exponentiate: e^0.057536≈1.059.

So,

1.333^1.2 ≈ 1.333 * 1.059 ≈ 1.411.

Next, ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(2/5 ) = (5/7 )^(2/5 )

5/7≈0.7143.

Compute 0.7143^(2/5).

Let me compute ln(0.7143)≈-0.3365.

Multiply by 2/5: -0.1346.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.1346)≈0.873.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ 1.411 * 0.873 ≈ 1.23.

So, a1 = 1.23 a2.

So, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is about 1.23 times that of Planet2.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/1.23 ) ≈ sqrt(0.813) ≈ 0.902.

Hmm, about 0.90, which is close to option A) ~0.98, but not exactly. But wait, perhaps my approximations are a bit off.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

First, K2/K1 = 1904.7 / 1428.57 ≈1.333333.

(1.333333)^(6/5) = e^( (6/5) * ln(1.333333) )

ln(1.333333)=0.28768207.

(6/5)*0.28768207=0.3452185.

e^0.3452185≈1.412.

(5/7 )^(2/5 )

5/7 ≈0.714286.

ln(0.714286)=−0.33647.

(2/5)*(-0.33647)=−0.134588.

e^(-0.134588)=≈0.8735.

So,

a1/a2≈1.412 * 0.8735≈1.233.

a2/a1≈1/1.233≈0.811.

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(0.811 )≈0.90.

So, about 0.90, which is closer to option A) ~0.98, but not exactly.

Hmm, but in the options, A is ~0.98, which is higher than 0.90.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio more accurately.

Let me compute (1.3333 )^(6/5 ) more accurately.

6/5 =1.2.

Using logarithms:

ln(1.3333)=0.28768207.

Multiply by 1.2: 0.28768207 *1.2=0.34521848.

e^0.34521848= e^0.34521848.

e^0.345218≈ 1.412 (since e^0.345≈1.412).

Now, (5/7 )^(2/5 ) = (0.7142857 )^(0.4 )

Compute ln(0.7142857)= -0.3364722.

Multiply by 0.4: -0.1345889.

e^(-0.1345889)= approx 0.8735.

So,

a1/a2=1.412 *0.8735≈1.233.

So, a1=1.233 a2.

So, a2/a1=0.8106.

T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.8106 )=0.90.

Hmm, which is about 0.90, but none of the options are exactly 0.90.

Looking at the options, the closest is A) ~0.98, which is about 0.98, but that's higher than 0.90.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me try using the exact formula for a in terms of K.

We have a = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( K ( M_star )^(1/3) ) )^(6/5 )

Wait, perhaps I should write the expressions correctly.

Wait, earlier, we found that a ∝ K^(-6/5) M_p^(-2/5) M_star^(1/5 )

So,

a1 / a2 = [ ( K2 / K1 )^6 * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^2 * ( M_star1 / M_star2 ) ]^(1/5 )

But since M_star1 = M_star2, that term is 1.

So,

a1/a2= [ (K2/K1 )^6 * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^2 ]^(1/5 )

= ( ( (K2/K1 )^3 )^2 * ( (M_p2/M_p1 ) )^2 )^(1/5 )

= [ ( (K2/K1 * M_p2/M_p1 )^2 ) ]^(1/5 )

= ( K2/K1 * M_p2/M_p1 )^(2/5 )

Wait, perhaps that's a better way.

So,

a1/a2= ( (K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

Substituting the values:

K2=1904.7, M_p2=5;

K1=1428.57, M_p1=7.

So,

( (1904.7 *5 ) / (1428.57 *7 ) ) = (9523.5 ) / (9999.99 )= approx 0.95235.

So,

a1/a2= (0.95235 )^(2/5 )

Compute ln(0.95235 )= -0.04879.

Multiply by 2/5: -0.019516.

e^(-0.019516 )= approx 0.9808.

So,

a1/a2≈0.9808.

So, a1=0.9808 a2.

Wait, that's a different result! So, a1/a2≈0.9808, meaning a1 is slightly smaller than a2? That contradicts earlier findings.

Wait, no, because according to this, a1 is 0.98 times a2, which means a1 is closer to the star than a2. But earlier, from K1 and K2, higher K would imply closer planet.

Wait, but K is higher for Planet2 (K2=1904.7 > K1=1428.57), which would imply a closer orbit because K is inversely related to a (from K ∝ a^(-5/6 ) ).

Wait, perhaps this is correct.

So, with a1/a2=0.9808, that means a2= a1 /0.9808≈1.0195 a1.

So, Planet2 is slightly farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, but its K is higher, which fits with that because K is inversely proportional to a. So, higher K for Planet2 would imply closer a? Or farther?

Wait, no, if a is smaller (closer), then K is higher, as K ∝ a^(-5/6 ), which is approximately a^(-0.833 ). So, as a decreases, K increases.

So, since K2>K1, a2<a1, so Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Which makes sense. So, a2 = a1 *0.9808.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong.

Wait, a1/a2=0.9808, so a1=0.9808 a2. So a2= a1 /0.9808≈1.0195 a1.

So, a2 is about 1.95% larger than a1, meaning Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, that seems correct because Planet2 has a higher K, so it's closer. But according to this, a2 is larger than a1, which would mean Planet2 is farther, which contradicts the idea that higher K implies closer planet.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the ratio a1/a2.

We have:

a1/a2= ( (K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

K2=1904.7, M_p2=5.

K1=1428.57, M_p1=7.

So,

(K2 * M_p2 )/( K1 * M_p1 )= (1904.7 *5 ) / (1428.57 *7 ) = (9523.5 ) / (9999.99 )= ~0.95235.

So,

a1/a2= (0.95235 )^(2/5 )

Compute ln(0.95235 )= ln(1 -0.04765 )≈ -0.04765 - (0.04765^2)/2 - ... ≈ -0.04765 - 0.00114 ≈ -0.04879.

Multiply by 2/5: -0.04879 * 0.4= -0.019516.

e^(-0.019516 )= approx 0.9808.

So, a1/a2≈0.9808, so a1=0.9808 a2.

Which means a2= a1 / 0.9808≈ a1 * 1.0195.

So, a2 is about 1.95% larger than a1, meaning Planet2 is farther from the star.

But earlier, from K1 and K2, we thought Planet1 was farther, but that's not correct.

Wait, a higher K implies a smaller a. Because K ∝ a^(-5/6 ), so if a is smaller, K is larger.

So, since K2>K1, a2<a1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

But according to this calculation, a2 is larger than a1 (a2=1.0195 a1 ), which implies that Planet2 is farther, which would contradict the higher K. So this must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a1/a2.

Wait, the formula I used was:

a1/a2= ( ( K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

But perhaps I should have a2/a1= ( ( K2 * M_p2 ) / ( K1 * M_p1 ) )^(2/5 )

Wait, no, no. Let me rederive.

We have a ∝ K^(-6/5 ) M_p^(-2/5 ) M_star^(1/5 )

So,

a1/a2= [ ( K2 / K1 )^6 ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^2 ( M_star1 / M_star2 ) ]^(1/5 )

Since M_star1 = M_star2, it's 1.

So,

a1/a2= [ ( K2^6 M_p2^2 ) / ( K1^6 M_p1^2 ) ) ]^(1/5 )

= [ ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^6 ]^(1/5 )

= ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^(6/5 )

Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.

So, the correct formula is:

a1/a2= ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^(6/5 )

Earlier, I used 2/5, which was incorrect.

So, let's recalculate.

( K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 )= (1904.7 *5 )/(1428.57 *7 )= (9523.5 )/(9999.99 )= ~0.95235.

So,

a1/a2= (0.95235 )^(6/5 )

Compute ln(0.95235 )= -0.04879.

Multiply by 6/5=1.2: -0.04879 *1.2 = -0.05855.

e^(-0.05855 )≈0.943.

So,

a1/a2≈0.943.

So, a2= a1 /0.943≈1.061 a1.

So, Planet2's semi-major axis is about 6.1% larger than Planet1's.

Which means Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(1.061 )≈1.03.

Which is approximately 1.03, so the ratio is about 1.03, which would be closest to option D) ~1.05.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

So, 1.03 is very close to option D) ~1.05.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.03, which is approximately 1.05.

Wait, but why earlier approaches gave different results. I think the main mistake was in the exponent when deriving a1/a2.

So, the correct approach is to use a1/a2= ( (K2 M_p2 )/( K1 M_p1 ) )^(6/5 ).

Which gives a1/a2≈0.943, so a2/a1≈1.061.

Thus, T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(1.061 )≈1.03, which rounds to ~1.05, option D.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident due to the multiple approaches and possible calculation errors. But considering the accurate method, the correct ratio is closest to option D.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant formulas. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating RV semi-amplitudes to semi-major axes
The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), semi-major axis \(a\), and the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{5/6}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their semi-major axes can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{K_2 \cdot M_{p,2}}{K_1 \cdot M_{p,1}}\right)^{6/5}
\]

Given:
- \(K_1 = 1428.57 \, \text{m/s}\), \(K_2 = 1904.7 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(M_{p,1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_{p,2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1904.7 \cdot 5}{1428.57 \cdot 7}\right)^{6/5}
\]

First, compute the ratio:

\[
\frac{K_2 \cdot M_{p,2}}{K_1 \cdot M_{p,1}} = \frac{1904.7 \cdot 5}{1428.57 \cdot 7} = \frac{9523.5}{9999.99} \approx 0.95235
\]

Now raise this to the power \(6/5\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = (0.95235)^{6/5}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(0.95235) \approx -0.04879
\]

Multiply by \(6/5\):

\[
\ln\left((0.95235)^{6/5}\right) = -0.04879 \cdot \frac{6}{5} = -0.05855
\]

Exponentiate:

\[
(0.95235)^{6/5} \approx e^{-0.05855} \approx 0.943
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.943 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.943} \approx 1.061
\]

### Step 2: Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{1.061}
\]

Calculate the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1.061} \approx 1.03
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated ratio \(T_{\text{eq,1}} / T_{\text{eq,2}} \approx 1.03\) is closest to option D (\( \sim 1.05 \)).

ANSWER: D
