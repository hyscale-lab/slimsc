Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'll walk through my thought process step by step. Let me break down each reaction and figure out what the products are, then determine the NMR signals for the final product.

The first step: acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with a halogen like Br2 in the presence of pyridine and an acid anhydride, it's probably undergoing a bromination. Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. Oh wait, bromine might be acting as an electrophile here. Oh! I think this is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, wait. Acetic acid itself doesn't have aromatic rings. Oh wait, maybe the acetic anhydride is acting as a catalyst or as a reagent. No, wait, Friedel-Crafts is for aromatic compounds. Maybe it's a different kind of bromination. Oh, wait, another possibility: the reaction could be introducing a bromine atom. Because acetic acid has an -OH group. So, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH. The OH is in a carboxylic acid, which is less reactive than alcohols. Or maybe it's an acetyl bromide formation? Wait, another thought: bromine and pyridine might be used in a bromination via an acylium ion formation. Oh, wait, maybe it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which brominates the alpha position of carboxylic acids. Oh, yes, that's right! The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction adds bromine to the alpha carbon of a carboxylic acid. So, in this case, acetic acid has one alpha carbon (the methyl group attached to the carbonyl). So, adding Br to that position would give bromoacetic acid. Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction would add a bromine to the adjacent carbon, which is the methyl group. So, the product would be CH2BrCOOH, right? Or maybe it's CH2BrCOO^- something, but I think the product is bromoacetic acid. So product 1 is bromoacetic acid.

Second step: product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. So, product 1 is bromoacetic acid. Heating with ethanol and H2SO4... sounds like an acid-catalyzed substitution. Since the Br is adjacent to the COOH group, perhaps it's an elimination or a substitution. Wait, in the presence of ethanol and acid, maybe it's an SN1 or SN2 reaction. Alternatively, it might be a nucleophilic substitution where ethanol acts as a nucleophile. But wait, bromoacetic acid has a Br on the alpha carbon. So, in acid conditions, perhaps it's more about forming an acylium ion again, but maybe the Br leaves, and ethanol comes in. So, the OH from ethanol would attack the adjacent carbon, leading to substitution. So, the product 2 would be ethyl ester of acetic acid? Wait, no. Wait, if we have bromoacetic acid (CH2BrCOOH) reacting with ethanol in acid, it's more likely an esterification. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the bromine is on the CH2 of the acetic acid. So, the reaction could be a nucleophilic substitution where the Br is replaced by an OEt group from ethanol. So, the product would be CH2OEtCOOH? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the OH from ethanol attacks the carbon where Br was, leading to substitution. Wait, but bromoacetic acid is CH2BrCOOH, so substituting Br with OEt would give CH2OEtCOOH, which is ethyl ester of acetic acid. But wait, wait. No, the substitution would actually form CH2OEtCOOH, which is actually the same as ethyl acetoacetate? No, wait, that's different. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is replaced by an ethoxide group. So, product 2 would be CH2OEtCOOH, which is the ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, but under acidic conditions with ethanol, substitution is more likely. So, product 2 is CH2-OEt-COOH, which is the ethyl ester. Wait, but wait, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, but this product 1 is CH2BrCOOH. So substitution would give CH2-OEt-COOH, but that's not an ester because the ester has the structure R-O-CO-R'. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the Br is on the CH2 adjacent to the COOH, substituting OEt would give CH2-OEt-COOH, which is an ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but wait, the COOH is still present. So, perhaps product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate? No, that's when the Br is on the ester. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first step. Let me think again. Oh, wait, in the first step, maybe the reaction is different. Maybe it's a bromination of the acetic acid to form acetyl bromide. Wait, but acetic acid is CH3COOH. If you add Br2 and pyridine, perhaps it's a substitution of the hydroxyl group to make an acyl bromide. Because pyridine can act as a base, absorbing the HBr. So, maybe product 1 is CH3COBr, acetyl bromide. Oh! That's possible. Because if you have acetic acid treated with Br2 and pyridine, it's a common way to make acyl bromides. So, product 1 is acetyl bromide, CH3COBr.

Then, product 1 is heated with ethanol and H2SO4. So, acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacting with ethanol in acid. That's an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution. The ethanol's O- would attack the carbonyl, leading to substitution of Br. So, product 2 would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOEt. That makes sense.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). So, ethyl acetate reacting with NaCN. Hmm, what reaction occurs when an ester reacts with CN-? Well, under certain conditions, esters can undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. So, perhaps the CN- attacks the carbonyl, leading to substitution of the OR group. So, the product would be CH3CONCN, acetylnitrile. Or wait, let me think: the ester is CH3COOEt. When it reacts with CN-, it would substitute the OEt group with CN, forming CH3COCN. But wait, wait, no. Let me get the structures right. Ethyl acetate is CH3COOEt, where Et is CH2CH3. When NaCN is added, in a nucleophilic substitution, CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. So, the mechanism would form an intermediate where the oxygen is negative, and then the leaving group (OEt-) leaves. So, product 3 would be CH3COCN, which is acetylnitrile.

Then, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. So, acetylnitrile (CH3COCN) reacting with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride is a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide. So, perhaps this is an alkylation reaction. But wait, the nitrile group is a good electron-withdrawing group, making the alpha carbons acidic. So, under strong basic conditions, the nitrile's alpha hydrogen (the CH3 group) might be deprotonated. But wait, the nitrile is CH3COCN. So, the alpha position is the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. So, when treated with NaH, which is a strong base, the H on CH3 is abstracted, forming a carbanion. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, which can undergo elimination or substitution. But wait, with excess NaH, perhaps the dihalide is used to perform an alkylation via a double substitution. Alternatively, the carbanion could attack a bromide in an SN2 reaction.

Wait, let me think again. The nitrile is CH3COCN. So, when NaH is added, the alpha H (from CH3) is removed, giving a carbanion: [CH2-]COCN. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane (which is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br) is present. So, each Br is a leaving group. The carbanion could attack one of the bromides in an SN2 reaction. But with excess NaH, perhaps both alpha positions are deprotonated, and each can attack a bromide. But wait, the nitrile group is only on one side. Let me think: the starting material is CH3COCN. The alpha position is CH3. So, the base deprotonates this to CH2^-COCN. Then, when 1,5-dibromopentane is present, perhaps the carbanion attacks each Br in turn, leading to alkylation.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, wait. 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, the molecule is CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br.

So, when the carbanion from the nitrile attacks, it attacks one of the CH2Br groups. But since the molecule is symmetric, perhaps both ends are the same, leading to similar products. Alternatively, each Br could be replaced by the carbanion.

Wait, but we have excess NaH, so perhaps two equivalents of the carbanion are generated, each attacking a Br in 1,5-dibromopentane.

So, the first substitution would give CH2-COCN attached to a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group? Hmm, no, perhaps the structure is more like:

The nitrile is CH3COCN. After deprotonation, it's CH2^-COCN. Then, attacking the 1,5-dibromopentane's CH2Br group. So, in an SN2 attack, the CH2^- would attack the carbon adjacent to Br, pushing the Br out.

Wait, perhaps the first substitution would form CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN. No, wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The nitrile's CH2- attacks one end of the dihalide. So, the first substitution would give CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN? Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider that each CH2Br in 1,5-dibromopentane is a leaving group, and the carbanion from the nitrile attacks each in turn. So, each substitution would add a CH2CH2CH2CH2 group to the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the structure in more detail.

The nitrile is CH3COCN. Deprotonation gives CH2^-COCN. This attacks the CH2Br in 1,5-dibromopentane. The SN2 attack would form a bond between the CH2- (from nitrile) and the adjacent CH2 (since the Br is a leaving group). So, the product after first substitution would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the dihalide as Br-(CH2)4-Br. So, each end has a Br. So, the carbanion from the nitrile attacks one end, say, the left Br: Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

The attack would occur on the first CH2 (the one attached to Br), so the structure after substitution would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCN, but with the CH2 connected to the nitrile. Wait, the carbanion would attack the carbon next to the Br, pushing Br out. So, the first substitution would add a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group to the nitrile? No, wait, the dihalide is five carbons, so 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, when the carbanion attacks one end, it would form a bond to the first carbon, leading to a chain of CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 attached to the nitrile. So, the product after one substitution would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution wrong. The carbanion (CH2^-) attacks the carbon adjacent to Br in 1,5-dibromopentane. So, the structure becomes CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2Br connected to the nitrile. But then, the Br is still present on the other end. Hmm, but with excess NaH, perhaps another substitution occurs. So, the product after both Brs are replaced would have two CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups attached to the nitrile.

Wait, no, because 1,5-dibromopentane has two Brs on each end of a five-carbon chain. So, each substitution would add a five-carbon chain to the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double alkylation. So, the initial nitrile is CH3COCN. After deprotonation, the CH2^- attacks one end of the dihalide, adding a five-carbon chain. Then, another equivalent of nitrile-derived carbanion attacks the other end of the same dihalide molecule, leading to a bridged structure? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each Br is attacked by a carbanion, leading to two substituents on each end.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bis-alkylated nitrile. So, each Br in 1,5-dibromopentane is replaced by the CH2COCN group.

Wait, that would form a compound where the central three carbons (CH2CH2CH2) are flanked by two CH2COCN groups. So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2CH2CH2-CH2COCN. Wait, no, because 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each Br is on a CH2 at each end. So, replacing each Br with CH2COCN would give (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN). So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, but wait, that would be a ten-carbon molecule? No, because 1,5-dibromopentane is five carbons, so each substitution adds two carbons (CH2) from each end. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon chain but that would lead to a longer chain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. The reaction is between a nitrile (CH3COCN) and 1,5-dibromopentane in the presence of excess NaH. NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha H of the nitrile to form a carbanion (CH2^-COCN). Then, the carbanion (a strong nucleophile) attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction. The 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms at each end of a five-carbon chain. So, each Br is a good leaving group. The carbanion can attack either end of the dihalide.

Wait, but with excess NaH, perhaps two equivalents of the carbanion are present. So, each Br in the dihalide could be replaced by the CH2COCN group. So, the product would be a molecule where the five-carbon chain (from 1,5-dibromopentane) is now flanked by two CH2COCN groups. So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. No, wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs on each end, adding a CH2 group from each substitution. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each Br is on a terminal CH2. So, when the carbanion attacks each Br, it would replace each Br with a CH2COCN group.

So, the product would be CH2COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2COCN. Wait, that makes a molecule where two CH2COCN groups are attached to each end of a three-carbon chain? No, wait, the middle part is three CH2 groups? Let me count: the dihalide is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, replacing each Br with CH2COCN gives CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. But that would be a molecule with a five-carbon chain (from the dihalide) between two CH2COCN groups. So, the structure would be:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

Wait, but that would be a 7-carbon molecule, with two CH2COCN groups on each end and a five-carbon chain in between? No, because the dihalide has five carbons (including the two Brs on either end). So, after substitution, each Br is replaced by a CH2COCN group. So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN, which is a molecule where two CH2COCN groups are attached to each end of a three CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait: the dihalide is CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br. So, when each Br is replaced by CH2COCN, the structure becomes CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. That's 2 CH2COCN groups attached to each end of a five-carbon chain (but wait, the central part is three CH2s between the two CH2COCN groups). Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN). So, that would be a molecule where two CH2COCN groups are attached to the ends of a five-carbon chain (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2). So, the structure is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN? No, that can't be right because the dihalide is only five carbons. Let me count again.

The dihalide is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br (five carbons in total). Each Br is replaced by a CH2COCN group. So, each CH2Br becomes CH2COCN. So, the product becomes CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. Wait, that's 2 CH2COCN groups connected by a five-carbon chain, but that would require six carbons between them, which doesn't add up. I think I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Wait, no, nitriles don't typically undergo conjugate additions. Alternatively, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is acting as a di-alkylating agent. So, each Br is replaced by the CH2COCN group, leading to a molecule with two CH2COCN groups connected by a three-carbon chain. Because 1,5-dibromopentane is five carbons, so when each Br is replaced, the product would have two CH2COCN groups attached to the ends of a three-carbon chain. So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-COCNCH2? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the product is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN, which would be a seven-carbon molecule with two CH2COCN groups on each end, connected by a five-carbon chain. But wait, that would require the dihalide to have five carbons, and each substitution adds one carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing it right. Maybe the product is a di-substituted nitrile where each substitution adds a four-carbon chain? I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should move on and think about the NMR.

Wait, maybe I should try to draw this out. The starting nitrile is CH3COCN. After deprotonation, it's [CH2-]COCN. Now, attacking 1,5-dibromopentane (CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br) in an SN2 reaction, the [CH2-] would attack one of the CH2Br groups. So, each substitution would add a CH2CH2CH2CH2 group to the nitrile. Wait, that's four CH2 groups. So, the product after one substitution would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN. But then, with excess NaH, another substitution could occur. So, the second substitution would add another CH2CH2CH2CH2 group on the other side. So, the final product 4 would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would imply a structure like CH2CH2CH2CH2-COCN-CH2CH2CH2CH2, which isn't possible because the nitrile is a single group. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a CH2 group, making a longer chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product is a di-substituted nitrile, where each substitution adds a four-carbon chain from each end, leading to a molecule like (CH2CH2CH2CH2COCN)2 connected by a single carbon? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal di-substitution, but that would require the same carbon to have two substituents, which isn't feasible in this case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 1,5-dibromopentane is used as a dihalide in a double alkylation. So, the nitrile's alpha carbon is deprotonated twice, and each Br in the dihalide is replaced by the nitrile-derived carbanion. So, the product would be a molecule where the nitrile's CH2 is connected to both ends of the dihalide's CH2 groups, leading to a structure where the nitrile is attached to a five-carbon chain, with each end being CH2COCN. So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. So, the molecule is a five-carbon chain (from the dihalide) with two nitrile groups attached to each end.

Wait, but that would make the structure (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN). So, the molecule would have two CH2COCN groups attached to each end of a five-carbon chain. So, the structure would be:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN

Wait, that's seven carbons in total, with two CH2COCN groups at each end. So, the molecule is a symmetrical di-alkylated nitrile.

Now, the question is about the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR of product 4.

Let me think about the structure. The molecule is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. Wait, that can't be right because 1,5-dibromopentane is five carbons, so after substitution, each end would have a CH2COCN group.

So, the structure is:

CH2COCN - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 - COCN

No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN

So, the molecule is (CH2COCN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(COCN)-CH2.

Wait, no, the dihalide is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. Replacing each Br with CH2COCN would give (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN). So, the structure is:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, that's a seven-carbon chain, with each end being CH2COCN, connected by a five-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

So, the molecule would have symmetry, as the two ends are mirror images. So, the NMR would show certain equivalent hydrogens.

Let me count the distinct hydrogen environments.

Looking at the molecule:

The structure is:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

Wait, no, because the dihalide is five carbons, so after substitution, each end has a CH2COCN attached. So, the structure is:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - COCN

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

So, the molecule is a five-carbon chain with CH2COCN groups on each end.

So, the structure is:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN

Wait, that's a seven-carbon chain, but no, because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons, so the substituted product would have two CH2COCN groups attached to a three-carbon chain. No, wait, perhaps it's:

Each substitution adds a CH2 group from the dihalide. So, the product would have a structure where each CH2Br in the dihalide is replaced by a CH2COCN group, leading to a molecule with two CH2COCN groups connected by a three-carbon chain. So, structure would be:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN

Wait, that's a five-carbon chain, with two CH2COCN groups at each end.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me approach it differently. Let me imagine the molecule as having a central three-carbon chain, with two CH2COCN groups on each end.

So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

So, the molecule is symmetric around the central three CH2 groups.

Now, in the NMR, I need to count the distinct hydrogen environments.

Let's break it down:

1. The CH2 groups attached to the nitrile (CH2COCN) groups. These are on both ends, but due to symmetry, they are equivalent. So, each of these CH2 groups has the same environment. So, this is one signal.

2. The CH2 groups next to the central three. Let's see: each end has a CH2 connected to the COCN, then a CH2 connected to the next CH2, etc. Wait, the structure is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. So, the central part is three CH2 groups. So, the four CH2 groups are as follows:

- The two terminal CH2 groups (attached to COCN): each is CH2COCN-CH2.

- The next two CH2 groups are in the middle: each is CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. So, the four CH2 groups are:

1. The two terminal CH2 groups (each attached to COCN): each is CH2-CO-CN.

2. The next two CH2 groups are in the middle: each is CH2 connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to label each set:

Looking at the molecule as:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

Wait, no, that's a five-carbon chain, but I think I'm getting the substituents wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2COCN)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2-COCN.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible symmetry.

Assuming the molecule is symmetric, the NMR would show fewer signals.

Let me think about the possible distinct environments:

1. The two terminal CH2 groups (each attached to COCN): these are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. So, their protons are equivalent, giving one signal.

2. The two CH2 groups adjacent to the terminal CH2 groups: these are also equivalent, so another signal.

3. The middle CH2 group: this is unique as it's between two equivalent CH2 groups. So, another signal.

So, in total, three signals from the CH2 groups.

Additionally, the COCN group's CH2 has its own protons, but wait, earlier steps: in product 4, the COCN is attached to CH2 groups. So, the CH2COCN groups would have their own CH2, which are equivalent on both ends, as the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, but the COCN is attached to a CH2, which is part of the longer chain. So, each CH2COCN has a CH2 group attached to the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

So, the molecule is a six-carbon chain, with CH2COCN groups at each end, and four CH2 groups in between.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons. So, when each Br is replaced, each end adds a CH2, making the chain longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic compound, but I don't think so because the reaction conditions don't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think about the actual structure again.

The reaction is CH3COCN treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH deprotonates the nitrile's alpha H, forming a carbanion. This carbanion attacks each Br in 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to substitution. So, each substitution adds a CH2 group from the dihalide.

Each substitution would add a CH2 group to the nitrile's alpha position.

Wait, no, perhaps the substitution adds a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted nitrile where each CH2Br in 1,5-dibromopentane is replaced by CH2COCN.

So, the structure would be (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN). So, the molecule is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Which would be a seven-carbon chain with CH2COCN groups on each end.

So, the molecule is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. Now, looking at the NMR:

The molecule is symmetric, so the left and right ends are mirror images.

Let's list the different types of protons:

1. The CH2 groups attached to the nitrile (CH2COCN): each of these has two protons. Due to symmetry, both ends are equivalent, so this is one signal.

2. The next CH2 group (second from each end): these are equivalent, so another signal.

3. The middle CH2 group: this is in the center and is unique, so another signal.

Wait, but how many CH2 groups are there in total? Let's count:

The structure is:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

Wait, that's seven carbons in total. So, each end is CH2COCN, then there are five CH2 groups in between. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me correct the structure again.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the substitution. Each Br in 1,5-dibromopentane is replaced by CH2COCN. So, the dihalide (CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br) becomes (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN). So, the structure is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN, which is a seven-carbon chain with CH2COCN at each end.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the molecule is:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

So, the molecule has seven carbons, with the two ends being CH2COCN and the middle five being CH2 groups.

Wait, no, wait: the dihalide is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, after substitution, each Br is replaced by CH2COCN. So, the structure becomes CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. So, the molecule is (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(COCN)CH2? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The dihalide has five carbons: Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

After substitution, each Br is replaced by CH2COCN, giving:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

So, the structure is CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN. Now, the molecule is a five-carbon chain (since the dihalide was five carbons, each substitution adds a CH2 group on each end, making it seven carbons in total? Or is it five? I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a seven-carbon chain with two nitrile groups at each end, connected by a five-carbon chain.

Regardless, perhaps the key is to determine the number of distinct H environments.

Let me imagine the structure as:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

So, the molecule is symmetric. Now, the H environments would be:

1. The terminal CH2 groups (each attached to COCN): each has two Hs. These are equivalent, so one signal.

2. The next CH2 group (second from each end): each has two Hs. These are equivalent, so another signal.

3. The middle CH2 group (third from each end): each has two Hs. These are equivalent, so another signal.

Wait, but if the molecule has seven carbons, then there are six CH2 groups. Wait no, perhaps it's a six-carbon chain. Let me count again.

If the dihalide is five carbons, each substitution adds a CH2 group at each end. So, the total number of carbons would be 5 + 2 (from each substitution) = 7? Or perhaps each substitution adds one carbon, making it 5 + 2 =7.

But perhaps it's better to think of the structure as (CH2COCN)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2(CH2COCN), which is seven carbons in total. So, the structure is:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

In this molecule, the symmetry would mean that the two terminal CH2 groups are equivalent, the two next CH2 groups are equivalent, the two middle CH2 groups are equivalent, and the central CH2 group may be unique. Wait, but in a seven-carbon chain, the middle would be the fourth carbon. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so the environments mirror each other.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the molecule as:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

So, the chain is seven carbons long, with the nitrile groups on each end.

The H environments would be as follows:

1. The two terminal CH2 groups (each attached to COCN): these are equivalent, so one signal.

2. The CH2 groups adjacent to the terminal ones: each has two Hs. These are equivalent on both ends, so another signal.

3. The next CH2 groups: each has two Hs. Again, equivalent on both ends, another signal.

4. The central CH2 group: this is in the middle of the chain. Due to symmetry, perhaps it's equivalent on both sides, but wait, in a seven-carbon chain, the middle is the fourth carbon. So, each side has three CH2 groups beyond the middle.

Wait, no, because the structure is symmetric. So, the CH2 groups on each side are mirrors. So, the environments would be:

- First and seventh carbon: CH2COCN-CH2.

- Second and sixth carbon: CH2-CH2.

- Third and fifth carbon: CH2-CH2.

- Fourth carbon: central CH2.

Wait, that's four distinct environments. So, four signals from the CH2 groups.

Additionally, the nitrile's CH2 group is part of the terminal CH2 groups, which we've already accounted for.

Wait, but wait: the nitrile group itself doesn't have any protons, right? Because it's COCN, so no H there.

So, all the Hs are on the CH2 groups along the chain.

So, four distinct CH2 environments, each giving a separate NMR signal.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the middle CH2 is unique and doesn't have a mirror image. Let me think: in a seven-carbon chain, the middle would be the fourth carbon. So, the chain is:

1: CH2COCN

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2

6: CH2

7: CH2COCN

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the chain would start and end with CH2COCN. So, the structure would be:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

So, seven carbons in total. The middle is the fourth carbon, and it's a CH2 group. Each side from the middle is symmetrical. So, the environments would be:

- Position 1 and 7: CH2COCN-CH2.

- Position 2 and 6: CH2-CH2.

- Position 3 and 5: CH2-CH2.

- Position 4: CH2 (central).

Wait, but positions 2 and 6 are each CH2 groups connected to a CH2 and another CH2 group. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are CH2 connected to two CH2 groups. So, their environments are the same as their counterparts on the other side. So, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. Only the central position (4) is unique.

So, the distinct H environments are:

1. Positions 1 and 7: terminal CH2 groups.

2. Positions 2 and 6: next CH2 groups.

3. Positions 3 and 5: next CH2 groups.

4. Position 4: central CH2.

So, four signals.

But wait, considering the molecule's symmetry, maybe some of these are equivalent. For example, positions 2 and 6 might be in the same environment, as each is adjacent to a CH2 group that's part of the terminal CH2COCN group. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 would each be adjacent to a CH2 group that's part of the middle structure.

So, four signals in total.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the terminal CH2, the next CH2, and the middle CH2 would each give a signal. That's three. But now I'm seeing four.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:

The molecule is symmetric, so the first and seventh CH2 are equivalent. The second and sixth CH2 are equivalent. The third and fifth CH2 are equivalent. The fourth CH2 is unique. So, that's four signals.

So, four signals from the CH2 groups.

But wait, the CH2 groups in positions 2 and 6 are each connected to a CH2 group (position 1 or 7) and another CH2 (position 3 or 5). So, they have the same environment as their counterparts on the other side. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are each connected to a CH2 (position 2 or 6) and another CH2 (position 4). So, they are equivalent. Position 4 is connected to two CH2 groups (positions 3 and 5), so it's unique.

So, four signals in total.

Wait, but I'm trying to think if any of these are split into multiple signals, but in the NMR, each environment would be a singlet if the neighboring groups are identical. However, in reality, coupling between adjacent CH2 groups would cause splitting, but the question is about the number of chemically distinct signals, not splitting.

So, the four CH2 environments would give four signals.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think again. Maybe each substitution adds a four-carbon chain, leading to a longer chain with six CH2 groups. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a six-membered ring, but I don't think so because the reaction conditions don't suggest ring formation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of distinct H types again. Let me imagine the structure as:

(CH2COCN)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Which is six carbons, with the two COCN groups at each end.

In this case, the chain has five CH2 groups between the two COCN groups. So, the structure is:

CO-C-N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the chain as:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

So, the molecule is a five-carbon chain with COCN groups on each end. So, the chain is:

COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

Wait, that's a five-carbon chain, but with COCN on each end. So, the chain is:

COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN.

So, that's five CH2 groups, making the total chain seven carbons (including the COCN groups). But perhaps I'm missing something.

In any case, regardless of the exact structure, the key is to count the distinct H environments.

Assuming the molecule is symmetric, the number of distinct H signals would be determined by the number of unique CH2 groups in the chain.

If the chain has four CH2 groups, with two on each end being equivalent, and two in the middle being equivalent, then:

- Each end's CH2: 1 signal.

- The next CH2 from each end: 1 signal.

- The middle CH2: 1 signal.

Total: 3 signals.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were four. I'm getting conflicting conclusions.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain has five CH2 groups, leading to three distinct environments.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the product is a di-substituted nitrile where the two substituents are four-carbon chains.

Wait, but perhaps the product is a 1,5-diacetyl cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-dimethyl nitrile, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the actual product is a five-membered ring, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a molecule where the nitrile's CH2 is connected to a five-carbon chain, making a single substitution. But that would require only one substitution, which doesn't fit with the use of excess NaH.

Another approach: perhaps the product is a bis-alkylated nitrile, with each substitution adding a four-carbon chain. So, the structure would be CH2COCN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2COCN, which is a seven-carbon chain with nitrile groups on each end.

In this structure, the H environments would be:

1. The two terminal CH2 groups (positions 1 and 7): each has two Hs, equivalent → 1 signal.

2. The two CH2 groups next to the terminals (positions 2 and 6): each has two Hs, equivalent → 1 signal.

3. The two CH2 groups in the middle (positions 3 and 5): each has two Hs, equivalent → 1 signal.

4. The central CH2 group (position 4): has two Hs, unique → 1 signal.

So, four signals in total.

But wait, the molecule has seven carbons, so the chain would be:

CH2COCN - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2COCN.

Which is seven carbons in total. So, positions 1-7.

But wait, positions 1 and 7 are CH2COCN.

Positions 2 and 6 are CH2.

Positions 3 and 5 are CH2.

Position 4 is CH2.

So, four distinct environments, as discussed.

But perhaps I'm mistaken, and the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic structure, but I don't think so because the reaction doesn't involve conditions that would favor ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dimer, but that doesn't fit the reaction steps.

Given all this confusion, perhaps I should accept that the molecule has four distinct H environments, leading to four signals. But looking at the answer options, the options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

Wait, none of the options match four. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Alternative approach: perhaps the final product is a tertiary alcohol or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are different. Let me recap:

1. Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating → product 1.

Alternative possibility: maybe it's an acetylation of bromine? No, more likely Friedel-Crafts acylation, but acetic acid doesn't have an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination of acetic acid's methyl group via electrophilic substitution. Acetic acid's alpha carbon is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, earlier I thought product 1 is CH2BrCOOH (bromoacetic acid), but another possibility is that the reaction is acetylation of bromine, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing a Br into the acetic acid, making CH2BrCOOH.

Then, step 2: product 1 (CH2BrCOOH) + ethanol, H2SO4 → substitution, making CH2OEtCOOH (ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid? No, wait, CH2OEtCOOH would be ethyl bromoacetate? Or perhaps it's ethyl ester with Br on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate: CH2BrCOOEt.

Then, step 3: product 2 (CH2BrCOOEt) + NaCN → substitution, replacing Br with CN.

So, product 3 would be CH2CNCOOEt.

Then, step 4: product 3 (CH2CNCOOEt) treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane.

Wait, but NaH is a strong base and would deprotonate the alpha H (the CH2 group attached to the CN). So, the CH2CN would become a carbanion. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane would undergo substitution, adding a five-carbon chain.

Wait, but perhaps the product after substitution would have the structure CH2Br-COOEt → CH2CN-COOEt after substitution with CN-, then CH2CN-COOEt treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane would form a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the initial steps, leading to a different product structure.

This is getting too complicated, and I'm probably not getting the correct structure, which is essential for determining the NMR signals.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, perhaps the correct answer is option B)5.

But wait, perhaps the structure after all steps is a di-substituted nitrile with four CH2 groups, leading to four signals. But none of the options match four. Alternatively, perhaps there are more substituents, leading to more signals.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has six distinct H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)5.

But honestly, I'm not confident with my structure, so I'm not certain about the NMR signals.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with acetic acid and ending with a final product whose $^1$H NMR spectrum is analyzed for distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown of the reaction sequence and the analysis:

---

### Reaction Sequence Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Acetic acid + Br₂, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating**  
   The reaction likely involves the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii bromination, where bromine is added to the alpha carbon of acetic acid. This forms **bromoacetic acid (CH₂BrCOOH)**.

2. **Step 2: Bromoacetic acid + ethanol, H₂SO₄**  
   Under acidic conditions, ethanol acts as a nucleophile, substituting the bromine atom in bromoacetic acid. This forms **ethyl bromoacetate (CH₂BrCOOEt)**, an ester.

3. **Step 3: Ethyl bromoacetate + NaCN**  
   Sodium cyanide substitutes the bromine atom in ethyl bromoacetate, forming **ethyl acetylnitrile (CH₂COCNEt)**.

4. **Step 4: Ethyl acetylnitrile + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane**  
   Sodium hydride deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the nitrile group, forming a carbanion. This carbanion undergoes two nucleophilic substitutions with 1,5-dibromopentane, replacing both bromine atoms. The final product is **bis-(4-pentyl)acetylnitrile**, a symmetric molecule with two nitrile groups attached to a five-carbon chain.

---

### NMR Analysis of the Final Product:

The final product, **bis-(4-pentyl)acetylnitrile**, has the structure:

**CH₂COCN-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂COCN**

This molecule is symmetric, with identical environments on both ends. The distinct hydrogen environments are as follows:

1. **Terminal CH₂ groups (positions 1 and 7):** These are equivalent due to symmetry, giving one signal.  
2. **CH₂ groups adjacent to the terminals (positions 2 and 6):** These are equivalent, giving another signal.  
3. **CH₂ groups in the middle (positions 3 and 5):** These are equivalent, giving another signal.  
4. **Central CH₂ group (position 4):** This is unique and gives a distinct signal.  

Thus, there are **4 distinct hydrogen signals** in the $^1$H NMR spectrum of the final product.

---

### Conclusion:

The number of distinct hydrogen signals in the $^1$H NMR spectrum of the final product is **4**. However, none of the provided answer options (A: 8, B: 5, C: 10, D: 12) match this result. Based on the reasoning and the closest match to the expected number of signals, the most plausible answer is **B: 5**.

Answer: B
