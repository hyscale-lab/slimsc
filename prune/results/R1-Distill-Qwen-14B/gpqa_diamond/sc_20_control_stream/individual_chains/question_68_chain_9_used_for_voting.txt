Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle. Initially, the magnetic moment is mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, so the particle has a magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S has components S_x, S_y, S_z. The magnetic moment is usually proportional to the spin, like mu = gamma S, but here it's specifically mu = gamma S_z, which is interesting. Wait, no, maybe that's a simplification. Or perhaps it's given that way for the initial state.

Wait, initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's magnetic moment will align with the field, right? Because in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field to minimize energy. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, probably. So the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z, which means its spin is either up or down along Z.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another is applied along Y. Oh, wait, but the problem says that both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, but when the field is turned off, does that mean the magnetic field becomes zero, and then another is applied along Y? Or does it switch from Z to Y direction, same strength? The problem says, "another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B." So I think that the initial B is in Z, then it's turned off, and a new B in Y is turned on. So the magnetic field changes from Z to Y direction.

But wait, what's the effect on the spin? Because when the magnetic field is applied, the spin will precess around the direction of the magnetic field. So initially, the spin is aligned with Z, then when the field is turned off, perhaps the spin starts to precess or change? Or wait, no, when the field is turned off, the spin isn't experiencing a torque, so maybe it's in a state that's no longer an eigenstate of S_z? Or perhaps, when the field is suddenly changed, the spin state doesn't change immediately, but the Hamiltonian does.

Wait, the particle's magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B_initial. Since the field is along Z, H_initial is proportional to S_z. So the eigenstates of the initial Hamiltonian are the spin-up and spin-down along Z.

When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero. Then, when the field is turned on in the Y direction, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B_y, which is proportional to S_y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but the spin state right after the field is turned off along Z and on along Y is the same as before, but the Hamiltonian changes. So the state of the spin might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time under the new Hamiltonian, causing the expectation values to oscillate.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So we're looking at <mu_z> as a function of time. Since mu_z is gamma times S_z, the average <mu_z> is gamma times <S_z>, so the frequency of <S_z> oscillation will determine the answer.

So, I think the key is to find the time dependence of <S_z> after the Hamiltonian changes.

Let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is changed, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the time evolution will be governed by H = omega * S_y, where omega is some frequency related to B and gamma.

Wait, let's be precise. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S_z. The Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B is H = - mu · B. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma S_y * B. So H = - gamma B S_y.

We can write this as H = (gamma B) (- S_y) = (gamma B) (i/2)(S_+ - S_-), because S_y = (S_+ - S_-)/(2i). Wait, let me recall the relation:

S_+ = (S_x + i S_y)/2
S_- = (S_x - i S_y)/2

So S_y = (S_+ - S_-)/(2i)

So H = - gamma B * (S_+ - S_-)/(2i)

But perhaps it's easier to think of H as proportional to S_y, so we can write H = (gamma B) * (i (S_+ - S_-)/2). Hmm, or maybe I can just think of H in terms of the ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go into the energy eigenbasis. The initial state is |+z> or |-z>, let's assume it's |+z>. After the field is turned on in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, whose eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is eigenstate with S_x = +hbar/2 (but wait, spin-1/2, so S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but in terms of units, if we're using S in units of ħ, then S_x has eigenvalues ±1/2, but perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, the spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z are all proportional to the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2, S_x = (ħ/2) sigma_x, same for S_y and S_z. So for S_y, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2) respectively.

But our initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of S_y. So under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the state will evolve in time. The time evolution is given by the time evolution operator U = exp(-i H t / ħ).

Wait, but in our case, H is proportional to S_y, which itself is proportional to sigma_y. So perhaps it's better to write H in terms of sigma_y.

Let me define H = - gamma B S_y.

Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, substituting:

H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H = (- gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The energy eigenvalues for sigma_y are ±1, so the energies for H are E_+ = (- gamma B ħ / 2)(1) = - gamma B ħ / 2 and E_- = (+ gamma B ħ / 2) (wait, wait, wait, because sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so H eigenvalues would be (- gamma B ħ/2)(+1) and (- gamma B ħ/2)(-1) ), which gives E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2), E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2).

But the initial state is |+z>, which in terms of sigma_y eigenstates is a superposition. Let me express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The state |+y> is (|+z> + i |−z>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - i |−z>)/sqrt(2).

So |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Because, if |+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2), then |+z> = (|+y> + i |-y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, let me compute:

Let me compute |+y> + |-y>:

(|+z> + i|−z> + |+z> - i|−z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) |+z>.

So |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Yes, that's correct.

So the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

The time evolution under H is given by each eigenstate evolving with its energy. So,

|psi(t)> = ( exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> + exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Let me compute E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 )
E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2 )

So,

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B/2) t )
exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t )

So,

|psi(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ]

I can write this as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |-y> ] where theta = (gamma B/2) t.

Now, I need to compute <S_z> as a function of time. Since mu_z = gamma S_z, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So, let's find <S_z(t)> = <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>.

But S_z is the operator with eigenstates |+z> and |−z>, so perhaps it's easier to express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y, which is a different operator, I need to find S_z in this basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_z> directly.

Let me note that |+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's plug these into |psi(t)>.

So,

|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)  + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Simplify inside:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i|−z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i|−z>) ) ]

So 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) is 1/2.

So,

= (1/2) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i|−z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i|−z>) ) ]

Now, group terms:

= (1/2) [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + i (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |−z> ) ]

Using Euler's formula:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta)

So,

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + i (2i sin(theta)) |−z> ]

Simplify:

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> - 2 sin(theta) |−z> )

= [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z> )

So, |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z>.

Wait, that's interesting. So the state is a combination of |+z> and |−z> with coefficients cos(theta) and -sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B/2 ) t.

Now, let's compute <S_z>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z> and S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

So,

<S_z> = <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>

= [ cos(theta)* < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z> ]

Let me compute this:

= cos(theta) [ cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z> ] + cos(theta)*(- sin(theta)) < +z | S_z | -z> 

+ (- sin(theta)) [ cos(theta) < -z | S_z |+z> ] + (- sin(theta))*(- sin(theta)) < -z | S_z | -z> 

But < +z | S_z | -z> = 0 because S_z |+z> and |−z> are orthogonal.

So,

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2) 

= [ (cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ] * (ħ/2 )

Using the double-angle identity, cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

So,

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

Since theta = (gamma B/2 ) t, 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the question is about the average of mu_z, which is gamma * S_z.

So,

< mu_z(t) > = gamma * < S_z(t) > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but mu is given as gamma S_z. So S_z is in units of hbar/2, so the product gamma S_z would have units of energy, but perhaps I need to double-check the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression for the Hamiltonian is slightly different in terms of the actual energy. Wait, the initial H was H = - mu · B. So the energy is proportional to B and mu.

But perhaps an alternative approach is to think about the energy levels. The energy levels would be determined by the eigenvalues of H. The energy difference between the two states (E_+ and E_-) is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So the energy difference is gamma B ħ. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant.

In quantum mechanics, the transition frequency between two energy levels is (E_2 - E_1)/ħ. So here, the energy difference is (gamma B ħ/2) - ( - gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, that seems too straightforward. But in the expression for <S_z>, the oscillation is at gamma B.

Wait, looking back, the expression I got for <mu_z(t)> is gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but let's think about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma B, so the average mu_z would oscillate at gamma B.

Hmm, but wait in our calculation, <mu_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

But let me think again. The energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2 ). The energy difference is gamma B ħ.

The time period comes from the phase difference between the two states. The time evolution of |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B/2) t )

The time evolution of |-y> is exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t )

So the relative phase between the two components is 2*(gamma B/2) t ) = gamma B t.

The interference between the two terms leads to oscillations in the expectation value. So the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the expression for <mu_z> oscillates at gamma B. So the average's oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but looking back at the calculation, the <S_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

But wait, in the expression I found earlier, <S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ), so the amplitude is ħ/2, and frequency is gamma B.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z = gamma S_z, so the average is gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the average <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the time evolution of |psi(t)> is governed by H. The frequency of oscillation in expectation values is often given by the energy splitting divided by ħ.

In this case, the energy splitting is 2 * (gamma B ħ / 2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B. So that's consistent.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check whether I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I computed <S_z> I found it to be ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t). But wait, the initial state was |+z>. So, when the field is turned off and the new field is applied along Y, the spin starts to precess around Y. The expectation value of S_z should oscillate, but the frequency depends on the energy splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Hamiltonian in terms of raising and lowering operators. H is proportional to S_y, which is (S_+ - S_-) / 2i. So H = (gamma B ħ/2) (S_+ - S_- ) / (2i) )? Wait, let me think. S_y = (S_+ - S_- )/(2i), so H = - gamma B S_y = - gamma B (S_+ - S_- )/(2i) = (gamma B (S_- - S_+ )) / (2i )

Hmmm, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Another approach: the time evolution of the expectation value <S_z> can be found using the Heisenberg equation of motion.

The Heisenberg equation is dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_z]

Since H = - gamma B S_y.

Compute [H, S_z] = [ - gamma B S_y, S_z ] = - gamma B [ S_y, S_z ]

We know that [ S_y, S_z ] = i ħ S_x.

So,

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) (- gamma B)( i ħ S_x ) ) = (i)(-gamma B) (i S_x ) )

i * i = -1, so this becomes:

dS_z/dt = (i)(-gamma B) (i S_x) ) = (- gamma B) ( -1 ) S_x = gamma B S_x.

So dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.

Similarly, we can write the equation for dS_x/dt.

[H, S_x] = [ - gamma B S_y, S_x ] = - gamma B [ S_y, S_x ] = - gamma B ( -i ħ S_z )

So,

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ) ( - gamma B (-i ħ S_z ) )

= (i) ( gamma B ) (i S_z ) )

i * i = -1, so:

dS_x/dt = (i)(i gamma B S_z ) ) = - gamma B S_z.

So now, we have the coupled differential equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z

This is a system of ODEs. Let me write them as:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z

We can write this as a matrix equation:

d/dt [ S_z; S_x ] = gamma B [ 0 1; -1 0 ] [ S_z; S_x ]

The solution to this is a rotation, leading to oscillations.

Let me assume that the initial condition is S_z(0) = ħ/2 (since the initial state is |+z> ), and S_x(0) = 0.

We can solve these equations. Let me set A = gamma B.

The equations become:

dS_z/dt = A S_x

dS_x/dt = -A S_z

Differentiating the first equation:

d^2 S_z/dt^2 = A dS_x/dt = A ( -A S_z ) = - A^2 S_z.

So,

d²S_z/dt² + A² S_z = 0

The solution is S_z(t) = C cos(A t) + D sin(A t)

At t=0, S_z(0)= ħ/2 = C

dS_z/dt at t=0 is A S_x(0) = 0 => D A = 0 => D=0.

So,

S_z(t) = (ħ/2 ) cos( A t )

So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with frequency A = gamma B.

Thus, the frequency is gamma B.

So the average mu_z = gamma S_z(t) = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Therefore, the oscillation frequency of mu_z is gamma B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and another field is applied along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$ (either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$). The initial Hamiltonian is $H_{\text{initial}} = -\mu \cdot B$, proportional to $S_z$. When the magnetic field is turned off and then re-applied along $+Y$, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H_{\text{final}} = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The new Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$ governs the time evolution of the spin state. Since $S_y$ is proportional to the Pauli matrix $\sigma_y$, the eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$, so the state evolves over time.

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The time evolution of the state leads to oscillations in the expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$. Using the Heisenberg equation of motion or directly solving the Schrödinger equation, it is shown that $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)$. Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the average $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates with the same frequency as $\langle S_z \rangle$. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle. Initially, the magnetic moment is mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is in the +Z direction.

So the state of the spin might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time under the new Hamiltonian, causing the expectation values to oscillate.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So we're looking at <mu_z> as a function of time. Since mu_z is gamma times S_z, the average <mu_z> is gamma times <S_z>, so the frequency of <S_z> oscillation will determine the answer.

So, I think the key is to find the time dependence of <S_z> after the Hamiltonian changes.

Let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is changed, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the time evolution will be governed by H = omega * S_y, where omega is some frequency related to B and gamma.

Wait, let's be precise. The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S_z. The Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B is H = - mu · B. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma S_y * B. So H = - gamma B S_y.

We can write this as H = (gamma B) (- S_y) = (gamma B) (i/2)(S_+ - S_-), because S_y = (S_+ - S_-)/(2i). Wait, let me recall the relation:

S_+ = (S_x + i S_y)/2
S_- = (S_x - i S_y)/2

So S_y = (S_+ - S_-)/(2i)

So H = - gamma B * (S_+ - S_-)/(2i)

But perhaps it's easier to think of H as proportional to S_y, so we can write H = (gamma B) * (i (S_+ - S_-)/2). Hmm, or maybe I can just think of H in terms of the ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go into the energy eigenbasis. The initial state is |+z> or |-z>, let's assume it's |+z>. After the field is turned on in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, whose eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is eigenstate with S_x = +hbar/2 (but wait, spin-1/2, so S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but in terms of units, if we're using S in units of ħ, then S_x has eigenvalues ±1/2, but perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, the spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z are all proportional to the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2, S_x = (ħ/2) sigma_x, same for S_y and S_z. So for S_y, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2) respectively.

But our initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of S_y. So under the new Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the state will evolve in time. The time evolution is given by the time evolution operator U = exp(-i H t / ħ).

Wait, but in our case, H is proportional to S_y, which itself is proportional to sigma_y. So perhaps it's better to write H in terms of sigma_y.

Let me define H = - gamma B S_y.

Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, substituting:

H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H = (- gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The energy eigenvalues for sigma_y are ±1, so the energies for H are E_+ = (- gamma B ħ / 2)(1) = - gamma B ħ / 2 and E_- = (+ gamma B ħ / 2) (wait, wait, wait, because sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so H eigenvalues would be (- gamma B ħ/2)(+1) and (- gamma B ħ/2)(-1) ), which gives E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2), E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2).

But the initial state is |+z>, which in terms of sigma_y eigenstates is a superposition. Let me express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The state |+y> is (|+z> + i |−z>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - i |−z>)/sqrt(2).

So |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Because, if |+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2), then |+z> = (|+y> + i |-y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, let me compute:

Let me compute |+y> + |-y>:

(|+z> + i|−z> + |+z> - i|−z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) |+z>.

So |+z> = ( |+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Yes, that's correct.

So the initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

The time evolution under H is given by each eigenstate evolving with its energy. So,

|psi(t)> = ( exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> + exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Let me compute E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 )
E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2 )

So,

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B/2) t )
exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t )

So,

|psi(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp(i (gamma B/2) t ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B/2) t ) |-y> ]

I can write this as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |-y> ] where theta = (gamma B/2) t.

Now, I need to compute <S_z> as a function of time. Since mu_z = gamma S_z, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So, let's find <S_z(t)> = <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>.

But S_z is the operator with eigenstates |+z> and |−z>, so perhaps it's easier to express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y, which is a different operator, I need to find S_z in this basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_z> directly.

Let me note that |+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's plug these into |psi(t)>.

So,

|psi(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)  + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Simplify inside:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i|−z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i|−z>) ) ]

So 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) is 1/2.

So,

= (1/2) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + i|−z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - i|−z>) ) ]

Now, group terms:

= (1/2) [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + i (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |−z> ) ]

Using Euler's formula:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin(theta)

So,

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + i (2i sin(theta)) |−z> ]

Simplify:

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> - 2 sin(theta) |−z> )

= [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z> )

So, |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z>.

Wait, that's interesting. So the state is a combination of |+z> and |−z> with coefficients cos(theta) and -sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B/2 ) t.

Now, let's compute <S_z>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z> and S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

So,

<S_z> = <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>

= [ cos(theta)* < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z> ]

Let me compute this:

= cos(theta) [ cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z> ] + cos(theta)*(- sin(theta)) < +z | S_z | -z> 

+ (- sin(theta)) [ cos(theta) < -z | S_z |+z> ] + (- sin(theta))*(- sin(theta)) < -z | S_z | -z> 

But < +z | S_z | -z> = 0 because S_z |+z> and |−z> are orthogonal.

So,

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2) 

= [ (cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ] * (ħ/2 )

Using the double-angle identity, cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

So,

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

Since theta = (gamma B/2 ) t, 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the question is about the average of mu_z, which is gamma * S_z.

So,

< mu_z(t) > = gamma * < S_z(t) > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but mu is given as gamma S_z. So S_z is in units of hbar/2, so the product gamma S_z would have units of energy, but perhaps I need to double-check the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression for the Hamiltonian is slightly different in terms of the actual energy. Wait, the initial H was H = - mu · B. So the energy is proportional to B and mu.

But perhaps an alternative approach is to think about the energy levels. The energy levels would be determined by the eigenvalues of H. The energy difference between the two states (E_+ and E_-) is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So the energy difference is gamma B ħ. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant.

In quantum mechanics, the transition frequency between two energy levels is (E_2 - E_1)/ħ. So here, the energy difference is (gamma B ħ/2) - ( - gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, that seems too straightforward. But in the expression for <S_z>, the oscillation is at gamma B.

Wait, looking back, the expression I got for <mu_z(t)> is gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but let's think about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma B, so the average mu_z would oscillate at gamma B.

Hmm, but wait in our calculation, <mu_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

But let me think again. The energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2 ). The energy difference is gamma B ħ.

The time period comes from the phase difference between the two states. The time evolution of |+y> is exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B/2) t )

The time evolution of |-y> is exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B/2) t )

So the relative phase between the two components is 2*(gamma B/2) t ) = gamma B t.

The interference between the two terms leads to oscillations in the expectation value. So the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the expression for <mu_z> oscillates at gamma B. So the average's oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but looking back at the calculation, the <S_z> oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

But wait, in the expression I found earlier, <S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ), so the amplitude is ħ/2, and frequency is gamma B.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z = gamma S_z, so the average is gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the average <mu_z> oscillates at frequency gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the time evolution of |psi(t)> is governed by H. The frequency of oscillation in expectation values is often given by the energy splitting divided by ħ.

In this case, the energy splitting is 2 * (gamma B ħ / 2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B. So that's consistent.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check whether I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I computed <S_z> I found it to be ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t). But wait, the initial state was |+z>. So, when the field is turned off and the new field is applied along Y, the spin starts to precess around Y. The expectation value of S_z should oscillate, but the frequency depends on the energy splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Hamiltonian in terms of raising and lowering operators. H is proportional to S_y, which is (S_+ - S_-) / 2i. So H = (gamma B ħ/2) (S_+ - S_- ) / (2i) )? Wait, let me think. S_y = (S_+ - S_- )/(2i), so H = - gamma B S_y = - gamma B (S_+ - S_- )/(2i) = (gamma B (S_- - S_+ )) / (2i )

Hmmm, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Another approach: the time evolution of the expectation value <S_z> can be found using the Heisenberg equation of motion.

The Heisenberg equation is dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_z]

Since H = - gamma B S_y.

Compute [H, S_z] = [ - gamma B S_y, S_z ] = - gamma B [ S_y, S_z ]

We know that [ S_y, S_z ] = i ħ S_x.

So,

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) (- gamma B)( i ħ S_x ) ) = (i)(-gamma B) (i S_x ) )

i * i = -1, so this becomes:

dS_z/dt = (i)(-gamma B) (i S_x) ) = (- gamma B) ( -1 ) S_x = gamma B S_x.

So dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.

Similarly, we can write the equation for dS_x/dt.

[H, S_x] = [ - gamma B S_y, S_x ] = - gamma B [ S_y, S_x ] = - gamma B ( -i ħ S_z )

So,

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ) ( - gamma B (-i ħ S_z ) )

= (i) ( gamma B ) (i S_z ) )

i * i = -1, so:

dS_x/dt = (i)(i gamma B S_z ) ) = - gamma B S_z.

So now, we have the coupled differential equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z

This is a system of ODEs. Let me write them as:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z

We can write this as a matrix equation:

d/dt [ S_z; S_x ] = gamma B [ 0 1; -1 0 ] [ S_z; S_x ]

The solution to this is a rotation, leading to oscillations.

Let me assume that the initial condition is S_z(0) = ħ/2 (since the initial state is |+z> ), and S_x(0) = 0.

We can solve these equations. Let me set A = gamma B.

The equations become:

dS_z/dt = A S_x

dS_x/dt = -A S_z

Differentiating the first equation:

d^2 S_z/dt^2 = A dS_x/dt = A ( -A S_z ) = - A^2 S_z.

So,

d²S_z/dt² + A² S_z = 0

The solution is S_z(t) = C cos(A t) + D sin(A t)

At t=0, S_z(0)= ħ/2 = C

dS_z/dt at t=0 is A S_x(0) = 0 => D A = 0 => D=0.

So,

S_z(t) = (ħ/2 ) cos( A t )

So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with frequency A = gamma B.

Thus, the frequency is gamma B.

So the average mu_z = gamma S_z(t) = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Therefore, the oscillation frequency of mu_z is gamma B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and another field is applied along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$ (either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$). The initial Hamiltonian is $H_{\text{initial}} = -\mu \cdot B$, proportional to $S_z$. When the magnetic field is turned off and then re-applied along $+Y$, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H_{\text{final}} = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The new Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$ governs the time evolution of the spin state. Since $S_y$ is proportional to the Pauli matrix $\sigma_y$, the eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$, so the state evolves over time.

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The time evolution of the state leads to oscillations in the expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$. Using the Heisenberg equation of motion or directly solving the Schrödinger equation, it is shown that $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)$. Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the average $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates with the same frequency as $\langle S_z \rangle$. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
