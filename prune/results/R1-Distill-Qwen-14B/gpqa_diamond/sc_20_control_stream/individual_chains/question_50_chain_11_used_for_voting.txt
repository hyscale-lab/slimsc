Okay, so I've got this question here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says my colleague has a Feynman diagram with a size estimate written next to it. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the task is to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, I remember that in Feynman diagrams, the number of loops is related to the order of the process and the possible divergences. Each loop contributes a certain factor to the amplitude, which affects the overall scaling.

The expression given seems to be a dimensional analysis or an estimate of the magnitude of some amplitude or a term in the perturbation series. I think each loop brings in a factor of 1/(4π), or maybe something involving the loop integral. Oh, right, loop integrals typically involve factors of 1/(16π²) per loop in four-dimensional spacetime because of the integral over the loop momentum.

Wait, let's break down each part. The term 1/(4π)^6 is part of the expression. If each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^something factor, maybe that's a clue.

Alternatively, I remember that in dimensional regularization, each loop introduces a factor of 1/(16π²), which is (1/(4π))² per loop. So for each loop, you get a (1/(4π))² factor. So if the denominator has (4π)^6, that would be (1/(4π))^6. So (1/(4π))^6 equals (1/(4π)^2)^3, which would be three loops. Because each loop contributes (1/(4π)^2), so three loops would be (1/(4π)^2)^3 = 1/(4π)^6.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. Each loop contributes a factor of 1/(16π²) which is (1/(4π))². So three loops would contribute (1/(16π²))^3 = (1/(4π)^6). So yes, that's matching the 1/(4π)^6 term. So that suggests three loops.

Other parts of the expression: alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e²/(4π), right? And g is a coupling constant. But the exponents here are alpha^3 and g^2. Hmm, but the question is about the number of loops, which depends on the topology of the diagram, not the couplings directly.

So the key part is the 1/(4pi)^6. And each loop contributing (1/(4pi)^2), so 6 is 2 *3, so three loops.

Looking at the options, option D is 3. So the answer should be D.

To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2
\]

In quantum field theory, each loop in a Feynman diagram typically contributes a factor of \((1/(4\pi))^2\) due to the integration over loop momenta in four-dimensional spacetime. Therefore, the term \((1/(4\pi))^6\) in the expression corresponds to three loops, since \((1/(4\pi))^6 = \left((1/(4\pi))^2\right)^3\). 

The other terms in the expression, such as \(\alpha^3\), \(g^2\), and \((Q/M)^2\), are related to the coupling constants and external scales but do not directly affect the determination of the number of loops. Thus, the presence of \((1/(4\pi))^6\) indicates that the diagram contains three loops.
