Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which energy difference option allows them to be clearly resolved?

The options are A to D: 10^-9 eV, 10^-11 eV, 10^-4 eV, and 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy-time uncertainty principle plays a role here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, which is ħ. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π. But wait, sometimes people just approximate it as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, more accurately, the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the uncertainty in time. So, for a given Δt, the minimum detectable ΔE is about ħ/(2Δt).

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. I think the lifetime is the time uncertainty Δt for each state. So, for each energy level, their lifetimes are τ1 and τ2. Wait, but how does that relate to the energy difference between the two states?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. Let me think again. The energy difference ΔE between two states would determine the transition frequency, which relates to the photon emitted when the state decays. But how does the lifetime of each state affect the ability to distinguish them?

Wait, another approach. When you have two energy levels with different lifetimes, the key is whether the energy difference is such that the transitions (if any) can be distinguished spectroscopically. But wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is the uncertainty in energy measurement.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the energy difference is large enough to be resolved given the lifetimes. So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would determine the minimum ΔE we can distinguish between them.

Wait, the energy uncertainty for each state is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So for a state with a longer lifetime (larger Δt), the energy uncertainty is smaller. Conversely, a shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty.

So, let's compute the energy uncertainties for each state.

For E1 with τ1 = 1e-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1)
Similarly, for E2 with τ2 = 1e-8 s: ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2)

But wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is what's important. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties because otherwise, the overlap in energy distributions would make it hard to distinguish the two states.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to consider that the energy difference should be greater than the combination of the uncertainties in each state. But wait, the energy difference is the absolute value, so maybe we can model this by considering the minimum required ΔE to be above the sum of the two individual ΔE's.

Wait, let me get the exact numbers. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties for E1 and E2 are about 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV, respectively.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the absolute value is |E2 - E1| = ΔE. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than some value. I think the condition is that ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties (because each state has its own spread in energy), so that the two states don't overlap.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the uncertainties. So the minimum ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ) eV.

Calculating that: 3.29e-7 is 32.9e-8, plus 3.29e-8 is 36.19e-8, so 3.619e-7 eV. So ΔE must be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9, which is way smaller than 3.6e-7. So no, this isn't enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8, which is 1e-8. That's 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is less than 3.6e-7. So not enough.

Wait, but wait a second. So the condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So in this case, the required ΔE is about 3.6e-7 eV. So let's look at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that would satisfy the condition.

Options A and B are way too small. Option D is 1e-8, which is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is still less than 3.6e-7 eV (which is 0.00000036 eV). So option C is the only one that meets the condition.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy uncertainty for each state is about the uncertainty in their own energies. So if the energy difference between E2 and E1 is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then you can distinguish them. Because each state's energy is spread out by their own ΔE, but the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than the combined spread.

Wait, another way: the energy levels are not infinitely sharp. Each has a line width (or energy spread) of about ΔE. So the separation must be larger than the sum of the line widths to be resolved.

Hence, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the minimum required ΔE is approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So looking at the options, only option C is higher than that.

So the correct answer is option C. 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) are related by:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau_1 \) and \( \tau_2 \)) of the two states serve as the time uncertainties (\( \Delta t \)). The energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2}
\]

Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller. Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

For E1 with τ1 = 1e-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1)

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties for E1 and E2 are about 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV, respectively.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the absolute value is |E2 - E1| = ΔE. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than some value. I think the condition is that ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties (because each state has its own spread in energy), so that the two states don't overlap.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the uncertainties. So the minimum ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ) eV.

Calculating that: 3.29e-7 is 32.9e-8, plus 3.29e-8 is 36.19e-8, so 3.619e-7 eV. So ΔE must be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) are related by:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau_1 \) and \( \tau_2 \)) of the two states serve as the time uncertainties (\( \Delta t \)). The energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2}
\]

Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller. Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

Answer: C
