Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question involves two reactions, I and II, each starting with different compounds. Then, after both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks the chemist observes in each case.

First, I need to figure out the products of each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones. LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is (S) configuration. When LAH reduces the ketone, does the configuration change? Oh right, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives the (R) configuration if the starting ketone is prochiral. But in this case, the starting compound is already chiral because of the 5-methoxy group. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think: the ketone is in position 3, and the methoxy is in position 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: It's hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is at C3. The structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-. Wait, no, maybe it's (CH2)2-CO-CH(OCH3)-(CH2)2-CH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, another approach: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So, the carbonyl is at C3. The 5-position would be the fifth carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but perhaps it's better to focus on the reaction.

When treated with LAH (LiAlH4), the ketone (at C3) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5 (since it's 5-methoxy). When the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 will be formed. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent, the addition is typically with retention of configuration? Or no, because the starting ketone is not chiral at C3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, that's not correct. Let's think in terms of IUPAC naming.

Hexan-3-one has the carbonyl at C3. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or is it CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would be pentan-3-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but I think the exact structure might not matter for the product of the reaction. The key point is that the ketone is reduced to an alcohol.

So, Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. The stereochemistry of the starting material is S at the 5 position. When the ketone is reduced, does the new OH group at C3 affect the configuration elsewhere? No, because the reduction is at C3, which is not the same carbon as the methoxy group. So, the configuration at C5 remains S, and the new OH is added, making it a secondary alcohol at C3.

So, the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, it's (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 2 and 4 are the positions, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's hexane. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, carbons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So, it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, 2 and 4 can't be on a five-carbon chain. Oh wait, 2 and 4 would be carbons 2 and 4, with three carbons in between. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? That's five carbons. Wait, no, that's 2 and 4: positions are correct.

But I'm not sure, but perhaps another approach: pentane-2,4-dione is an diketone, so it has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, 2 and 4 are not adjacent. So, in pentane, positions 2 and 4 are separated by a CH2 group. So structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. So, yes: 2 and 4 are the ketone positions.

So pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)2COCH2COCH3, no, wait, perhaps more accurately: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, no, that would be six carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed.

Now, when treated with NaBH4. NaBH4 is a milder reducing agent than LAH, but it can reduce ketones. However, in the case of diketones, what happens?

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones. But how does it react here?

When a diketone is treated with a reducing agent like NaBH4, each ketone group can be reduced. However, NaBH4 is a selective reducing agent—wait, but wait, in this case, since both ketones are in the same molecule, both are reduced.

But wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough reductant for ketones, but in the presence of two ketone groups, it will reduce both.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? Or perhaps O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. I think I need to correct that. Let me think: pentane has five carbons, so positions 2 and 4 would be CO groups. So, the structure is CH2(COCH3)-CH2-COCH2CH3? No, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, but that would be five carbons? Let me count: the carbons are 1: O=C-, 2: CH2, 3: CH2, 4: CO, 5: CH3? No, that's five. So, structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, but NaBH4 reduces each ketone group. So, each ketone (at C2 and C4) is reduced to an alcohol. So, each O becomes an -OH group.

Wait, but when you have two ketone groups in a molecule, and you reduce both, you get two alcohol groups. So, pentane-2,4-dione would become pentane-2,4-diol. Wait, but wait: no, each ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol.

So, the product would have two secondary alcohol groups: at C2 and C4.

Wait, but wait: the structure would be HO-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So, each ketone is at C2 and C4.

After reduction with NaBH4, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait: Let me think again. The starting molecule is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. When both ketones are reduced, each becomes an -OH group, so the product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but wait, the original molecule is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, which is:

O=C-(CH2)2-CO-CH3. So, when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol, so the product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Or is it HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, the starting molecule is (I think) O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, so when you reduce each of the two ketones:

At C2: O=C becomes -CH2-OH? No, wait, no: reduction of a ketone R2CO becomes R2CH-OH. So, each ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, Reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait: pentane-2,4-dione would have the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. When each ketone is reduced, the product would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make it 2,4-pentanediol. So, the product of Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait a second. Does NaBH4 reduce both ketones in this case? Because NaBH4 is generally a good reducing agent for ketones, but sometimes in diketones, if the molecule is symmetrical, it might form a single product, but in this case, the molecule is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3—so it's symmetrical around the central CH2. So, when both ketones are reduced, the product is a diol where the two OH groups are on C2 and C4.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but what about the stereochemistry? Because each reduction could lead to the formation of a stereocenter. However, when the ketones are symmetrical, the reduction would give a racemic mixture, but in this case, the starting diketone is symmetrical, so the diol would have two identical stereocenters. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, let's think. The starting material is a symmetrical diketone, so when reduced, the diol would have two secondary alcohols on C2 and C4. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4, so if the OH groups are on the same side (R configuration), the compound would be a meso form.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones, but in the case of a symmetrical diketone like pentane-2,4-dione, the product would be a meso diol. Because the two OH groups would be mirror images of each other, leading to an internal plane of symmetry and thus no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a symmetrical diketone, do you get a single product (meso) or a racemic mixture? Because each ketone is symmetrical, so reducing each would lead to the same configuration on both sides. So, the diol would have two stereocenters, but they would be identical due to the symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, the product of Reaction II is meso-2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, wait. NaBH4 is a selective reductant. It can reduce ketones but not aldehydes. But in this case, both are ketones, so both are reduced. So, the product is meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Now, after both reactions, the products are combined. So, from Reaction I, we have (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. From Reaction II, we have meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait. Reaction I's product is a secondary alcohol, and Reaction II's product is a diol. So, when combined, we have two different products: the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Now, the products are run on HPLC columns: one normal-phase, and one chiral stationary phase.

The question is how many peaks are observed in each case.

First, normal-phase HPLC. Normal-phase is usually silica-based, which is polar. The mobile phase is less polar (like hexane/ethyl acetate). In normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. So, more polar compounds elute earlier.

Now, the two products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group. It's a chiral molecule.

2. meso-2,4-pentanediol: a diol, but it's a meso compound, so it's achiral. So, in the normal-phase HPLC, the meso diol would be a single peak because it's not chiral—its structure is symmetrical.

Wait, but wait. So, the two products are (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral) and meso-2,4-pentanediol (achiral). So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, each would have a different retention time. Because they have different structures, their polarity would be different.

So, normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks: one for the 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for the meso diol.

Wait, but wait. The products are from Reaction I and II. So, after combining, we have two compounds: each from their respective reactions. So, the normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks.

But wait, let me think again. Reaction I gives one product, and Reaction II gives another. So, when combined, the mixture contains two compounds. Each would have a distinct elution profile in normal-phase HPLC. So, normal-phase would show two peaks.

Now, what about the chiral HPLC column? Chiral columns separate enantiomers. So, for each chiral compound, it would show two peaks (enantiomers). But for achiral compounds, it would show a single peak.

In the mixture, we have (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a single enantiomer) and meso-2,4-pentanediol (which is achiral).

So, the chiral HPLC would separate:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: since it's a single enantiomer, it would present as a single peak.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no: no, in chiral HPLC, if the compound is chiral, it would have two peaks (R and S), but if the sample is a single enantiomer, it would give one peak. Because chiral columns can separate enantiomers. So, if you have a racemic mixture, you'd get two peaks. But if you have a single enantiomer, only one peak.

In this case, Reaction I's product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, it's a single enantiomer. Reaction II's product is meso, so it's achiral. So, when run on a chiral column:

- The (S) alcohol would give one peak.

- The meso diol is not chiral, so it would also elute as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. How does a chiral column interact with an achiral compound? The stationary phase is chiral, so an achiral compound may not be retained or might not have much interaction, leading to a single peak. Alternatively, it might not be separated if the column is designed for chiral compounds.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think. On a chiral column, molecules are separated based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase. Enantiomers would have opposite configurations and would elute at different times. But for an achiral compound, it doesn't have a chiral center, so it wouldn't interact in the same way. So, the meso diol would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. The meso diol is a diol with two stereocenters but with an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, in the chiral column, it would behave as an achiral molecule. So, it would not split into enantiomers and would elute as a single peak.

So, on the chiral column, the two products would give how many peaks? Let's see:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral, so on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak because it's a single enantiomer.

- meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral, so it elutes as a single peak.

So, total peaks in chiral HPLC: 2 peaks.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the meso diol is a diol, but is it a single peak on chiral column? Or would it interact differently?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol could have some interaction, but since it's achiral, it doesn't split. So, two peaks in total: one for the (S) alcohol and one for the diol.

Wait, but the diol is 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is a diol with two OH groups. Could the diol have another chiral center?

Wait, no. Because it's a meso compound, the two stereocenters are mirror images, making the molecule achiral.

So, in the chiral column, it would not split into enantiomers and would be a single peak.

So, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for the meso-2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, wait. The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so in the chiral column, it's one peak, and the diol is another peak, so total two.

But wait, no, the diol is a diol but achiral. So, in the normal-phase HPLC, how many peaks? Two, as each compound is a different molecule.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Because Reaction II's product is a diol, but when you have two OH groups, it's a diol, but is it a single compound or two isomers?

Wait, no, the diol is meso, so it's a single compound, not two.

So, combining Reaction I and II's products, we have two compounds: a chiral alcohol and an achiral diol.

So, normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks, and chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Looking at the options:

Option D says 3 peaks in both. Option B says 3 in chiral, 2 in normal. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is not just one compound. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the OH is added to C3. The configuration at C5 remains S because it's not involved in the reduction.

So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, it's a single enantiomer.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. We determined that the product is meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: after reduction, NaBH4 in excess might have a different effect.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone. NaBH4 can reduce each ketone group to an alcohol. So, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. But since the starting material is symmetrical, the product is a meso compound.

So, the product of Reaction II is a single compound, meso.

So, in the mixture after combining reactions I and II, we have two compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral) and meso-2,4-pentanediol (achiral).

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, each would be a separate peak, so 2 peaks.

When run on a chiral HPLC column: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral, so it would give one peak (since it's a single enantiomer). The meso diol is achiral, so it would also give one peak. So, total two peaks.

But looking at the options, none of the options have 2 peaks in both cases. The options are:

A) 5 and 4
B)3 and 2
C)4 and 2
D)3 and 3

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is not just (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but something else.

Wait, because the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is probably:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurately:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Or is it (S) configuration at C5? Hmm, perhaps the product's configuration could lead to another stereoisomer.

Wait, when the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 is the same as the starting carbonyl's configuration. Wait, no, the carbonyl is planar, so the reduction would lead to a new stereocenter.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to the (R) configuration in the product. Wait, because LAH adds the hydride from the less substituted side.

Wait, in the case of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the ketone is at C3. When reduced with LAH, the hydride would add from the less hindered side. But the configuration at C5 is (S), but that doesn't affect the configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Let me imagine the structure:

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is at C3. The structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3.

So, the (S) configuration is at C5: the methoxy is on C5.

When LAH reduces the ketone, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon (C3) from the less hindered side. Since the starting material has a methoxy group on C5, which is on the same side as the carbonyl, perhaps the addition of the hydride would occur from the opposite side, leading to the (R) configuration at C3.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5. How does that affect the configuration at C3 upon reduction?

Alternatively, perhaps in the starting material, the configuration at C5 is (S), but the reduction of the ketone at C3 would create a new chiral center. So, the product would be (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Or perhaps the configuration is retained.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about this. But perhaps I should accept that the product of Reaction I is a secondary alcohol with a new stereocenter at C3, which could be R or S. But since the starting material was S at C5, perhaps the new configuration is R.

Wait, perhaps the product would have R configuration at C3, making it (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But regardless, the product would be a chiral compound, either R or S.

So, the product from Reaction I is a single chiral alcohol.

Wait, but wait. If the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction adds an OH at C3, which is a new stereocenter, then the product would be a diastereomer, not an enantiomer. Because it has two stereocenters: C3 (new) and C5 (original S).

So, the product of Reaction I is a diastereomer, but in this case, it's a single diastereomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, the product is a single compound with two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reduction adds an OH group at C3, creating a new stereocenter. So, the product will have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

But the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, and the new configuration at C3 depends on the reduction. So, the product will have two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer.

Wait, but wait. The original starting material has a single stereocenter at C5. After reduction, it gains a new stereocenter at C3. So, the product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters.

So, the product of Reaction I is (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, assuming the new stereocenter is R.

But wait, the question is whether the product is a single compound or a racemic mixture. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single diastereomer.

So, the product of Reaction I is a single compound with two stereocenters: C3 (R or S) and C5 (S).

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Perhaps I should move on.

Now, after combining the products from Reaction I and II, we have two compounds: Reaction I gives a diastereomer with two stereocenters (so chiral), and Reaction II gives a meso compound (achiral).

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, each would be separated into a different peak, so two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, the diastereomers would be separated based on their chirality. Wait, but wait: the chiral column is for separating enantiomers. Diastereomers would not be separated on a chiral column because they have different physical properties and would elute at different times regardless of the column.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Chiral columns can separate enantiomers. Diastereomers, which are not mirror images, would still be separated based on their interaction with the stationary phase. So, if you have a diastereomer, it would elute at a different time than another diastereomer. But in this case, we have two different compounds: one is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, and the other is a meso compound.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC:

- Two different compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, two peaks.

Number of peaks in chiral HPLC:

- The meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak.

- The (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral but a single enantiomer, so it would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. The (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has two stereocenters. So, is it a single enantiomer or a diastereomer?

No, wait: it has two stereocenters, so it's a diastereomer, but in the context of the chiral column, each enantiomer would be separated. But if it's a single diastereomer, it would behave as a single entity on a chiral column. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two stereocenters. So, on a chiral column, it would be a single peak, and the meso diol would also be a single peak. So, two peaks on both columns.

But looking at the options, none of the options have two peaks in both cases. The options are:

A) 5 and 4
B)3 and 2
C)4 and 2
D)3 and 3

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the products.

Let me re-examine Reaction II.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. When NaBH4 is used, both ketones are reduced. So, both become secondary alcohols. So, product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: when you reduce a diketone, could you get something else? Or perhaps, in the case of a diketone, could the reducing agent cause a different reaction?

Wait, another possibility: the diketone could undergo a pinacol rearrangement, but that usually requires more forcing conditions, like acid. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, not acidic. So, probably no rearrangement; just reduction.

So, product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

So, the product of Reaction II is a single compound.

So, when combining the two products, we have two compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, normal-phase HPLC would have two peaks, and chiral HPLC would have two peaks.

But according to the options, that's not an option. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a pair of enantiomers, not a single compound. Let me think.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced with LAH, the ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent that tends to give the (R) configuration when reducing ketones because it adds the hydride from the less hindered side. But the starting material's configuration at C5 (S) may influence the approach of the hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, regardless, the product would be a single diastereomer with two stereocenters.

So, in the mixture, we have two compounds: a diastereomer (from Reaction I) and a meso compound (from Reaction II).

When run on normal-phase HPLC, each would have a different retention time, so two peaks.

When run on a chiral HPLC, the diastereomer would have two possible stereoisomers, but since it's a single diastereomer, it would give one peak. The meso compound would also give one peak. So, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe in Reaction II, the product is a pair of enantiomers, not a meso compound. But that would be the case if the starting diketone were not symmetrical.

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical. So, when reduced, the product is a meso compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So, perhaps the initial analysis is correct, and the answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the products are different. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So, combining the two products, we have two compounds, each contributing one peak in normal-phase HPLC. So, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC:

- The (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single enantiomer, so one peak.

- The meso diol is achiral, so one peak.

So, two peaks in both cases.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound. Let me think.

If the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, and it's reduced with NaBH4, which is a strong enough reductant, both ketones are reduced. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But if the starting material is not symmetrical, the product would be a pair of enantiomers. But wait, in this case, the starting material is symmetrical (O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3 is symmetrical). So, the product is a meso compound, leading to a single peak on normal-phase HPLC and a single peak on chiral HPLC.

But I'm back to the same conclusion, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers. No, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should be a single diastereomer, not a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a secondary alcohol with two stereocenters (C3 and C5). So, it's a diastereomer, but in this case, it's a single compound.

So, the products are:

1. (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single compound).

2. meso-2,4-pentanediol (single compound).

So, when run on HPLC columns:

Normal-phase: two peaks.

Chiral-phase: two peaks.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product. Let me recount.

Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

After reduction, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no, the starting material has a methoxy on C5, which is a stereocenter. The ketone is on C3. Upon reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter.

So, the product will have two stereocenters: C3 (new) and C5 (original). So, it's a diastereomer.

But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single diastereomer. So, it's a single compound, not a mixture.

So, in the mixture, two compounds: one with two stereocenters (but single compound) and one meso.

When run on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: the diastereomer is a single compound, so one peak, and the meso is another. So, two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing that the diol is a diastereomer and thus would separate into more than one peak on the chiral column.

Wait, another thought: maybe the diol is a pair of enantiomers. But no, because if the starting material is symmetrical, the diol would be a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a single compound and the alcohol is a single compound, giving two peaks in both cases.

But since the options don't have an option with two peaks in both cases, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. Because when you reduce a ketone, you can get a racemic mixture if the starting material is prochiral. Wait, but the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is not prochiral at C3. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is at C3, so the addition of the hydride would create a new chiral center, but the starting material's configuration at C5 affects the approach of the hydride.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

So, the product is (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single diastereomer.

So, in the mixture, we have two compounds: one diastereomer and one meso compound.

So, normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: how many peaks?

The diastereomer is a single compound with two stereocenters. On a chiral column, would it separate into two peaks? No, because it's a single compound. The meso diol is a single compound as well.

So, two peaks in both cases.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the number of products.

Wait, another angle: perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent. Could it reduce any other functional groups? The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. No other functional groups except the ketone. So, only one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → meso-2,4-pentanediol. Only one product.

So, combining, two products.

So, what's the correct number of peaks?

The options don't include two in both. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial analysis is wrong regarding the diol. Maybe the diol is not meso but a pair of enantiomers.

If the starting material were not symmetrical, the diol would be a pair of enantiomers. But in this case, the starting material is symmetrical, so the diol is meso.

So, perhaps I'm stuck because none of the options match my current analysis. But looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 peaks in both.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing compounds. Let me recount:

Wait, after Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

After Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, the mixture has two compounds: a chiral alcohol and a meso diol.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the products. Let me re-examine Reaction II.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

Wait, another possibility: NaBH4 does not reduce both ketones. Because NaBH4 is a milder reagent, perhaps it only reduces one ketone. But I thought NaBH4 can reduce both, but perhaps not. Wait, no, NaBH4 is a strong enough reagent to reduce ketones, and in the presence of excess, both would be reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is not a symmetrical molecule. Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the structure.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. That's a symmetrical molecule. So, upon reduction, it becomes meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, the product is a single compound.

So, the mixture has two compounds: Reaction I's product and Reaction II's product.

Thus, normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But none of the options match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's only possible if the starting material were not chiral. But the starting material is chiral, so the product would have a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, but that can't be because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer with two stereocenters, leading to a single compound, and the diol is a single compound. So, two compounds in the mixture.

Thus, two peaks in both columns.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 in both.

Wait, but why three?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, but it's actually two diastereomers. No, the starting material is a single compound, so the product would be a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is actually two diastereomers, but I don't think so because it's a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the TLC monitoring. The question states that the reactions are 100% completed, so no starting materials remain.

So, the products are as I thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product.

Let me think: the starting material has a chiral center at C5. Upon reduction, a new chiral center is formed at C3. So, the product has two chiral centers. So, it's a diastereomer but a single compound, not a racemic mixture.

So, the mixture has two compounds: one with two stereocenters (but single) and one meso.

So, on chiral column, each would be a single peak. So, two peaks.

But perhaps the meso diol would split into two peaks on the chiral column because it's a diol with two OH groups. No, because it's a meso compound, it's not chiral, so it would give one peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A)5 and4

B)3 and2

C)4 and2

D)3 and3

I think I must have made a mistake in the products. Let's re-examine Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, you produce a secondary alcohol. The LAH would add the hydride to the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the alcohol.

In this case, the starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction occurs at C3, so the configuration at C5 remains S. The new OH is added at C3, which becomes a new stereocenter. So, the product is (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So, the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. So, it's a single compound.

So, in the mixture, two compounds: one single diastereomer and one meso diol.

Thus, normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: the diastereomer would have two stereocenters, but since it's a single compound, it would give one peak. The meso diol would give another peak. So, two peaks.

But again, none of the options have two peaks in both cases.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the diol is not meso. Let me think again.

Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Upon reduction, both ketones are converted to OH groups, leading to HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, is that structure correct? Let me count the carbons: positions 1 to 5.

1: HO-CH2

2: CH2

3: CH(OH)

4: CH2

5: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-express it.

The structure of pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

After reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's 2,4-pentanediol.

But this structure has two OH groups on C2 and C4. So, each is a secondary alcohol.

Now, the configuration of the OH groups: since the starting material is symmetrical, the two OH groups would be on the same side, leading to the meso form.

So, the product is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound.

So, the mixture has two compounds: one with two stereocenters (single) and one meso.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a pair of enantiomers? No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the diol is a diastereomer, not a meso compound. But no, because the starting material is symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers because I made a mistake in its structure.

Wait, if the structure were O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CO-CH3, then the diol would not be meso. But the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical.

So, perhaps I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be two peaks in both cases, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. How?

Because when you reduce a chiral ketone with a strong reducing agent like LAH, you could get a racemic mixture. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, not a racemic mixture.

So, perhaps the correct answer is two peaks in both HPLC methods, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is D) 3 and3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the meso diol is actually two diastereomers. But no, it's a single compound.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a pair of diastereomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is not meso but a pair of enantiomers. But that's not possible because the starting material is symmetrical.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3 peaks in both.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers. But if the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be meso, not enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has only one stereocenter. No, because the product now has the OH at C3 and the methoxy at C5, both stereocenters.

So, two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer, but a single compound.

So, the mixture has two compounds: one with two stereocenters and one with none (meso).

Thus, normal-phase: two peaks.

Chiral: two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

Wait, how? If Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers, which would give two peaks on chiral HPLC and one on normal.

But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product can't be a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound, and Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers. But that's not possible because the diol is meso.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be two peaks in both cases, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D: three peaks in both.

Wait, but why three?

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. Let me think. Wait, no. The starting material is chiral, so the product would have a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the products are more than two. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I produces a diastereomer, which in turn could produce two diastereomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol has two stereocenters and is a meso compound, leading to two peaks on the chiral column because it's achiral. No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options. Since the correct analysis leads to two peaks in both cases, but that's not an option, I think I must have made a mistake in the number of products.

Wait, perhaps the diol is not a meso compound. Let's consider that the diol is a pair of enantiomers. But for that, the starting material would need to be unsymmetrical, which it isn't.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: three peaks in both.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral column and one on the normal phase.

But no, the starting material is symmetrical, so the diol is meso.

In that case, I think the correct answer is that in normal-phase, two peaks, and chiral, two peaks. But since that's not an option, I'm forced to choose the closest option, which is option D:3 peaks in both.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral and one on normal. So, the total would be three on chiral and two on normal.

Looking at the options, option B is 3 and 2.

Wait, so in normal-phase: two peaks (alcohol and diol).

Chiral: three peaks (the alcohol's two enantiomers and the diol).

But the alcohol is a single enantiomer, so it would give one peak on chiral, and the diol would give two peaks if it's a pair of enantiomers.

But the diol is a meso compound, so it would give one peak on chiral.

So, total on chiral: two peaks.

But that would be option C:4 and2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral, and one peak on normal.

Thus, normal-phase: two peaks (alcohol and diol).

Chiral: three peaks (alcohol and two diastereomers of diol).

But that doesn't fit either.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the available options, I'll choose option D:3 peaks in both.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC after combining the products.

### Reaction I:
- **Starting material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Reaction**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3. The configuration at C5 (S) remains unchanged.
- **Product**: (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, a single diastereomer with two stereocenters.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (reduces ketones).
- **Reaction**: Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols. The molecule is symmetrical, leading to the formation of a meso compound.
- **Product**: meso-2,4-pentanediol, a single achiral compound.

### Combined Products:
- After combining the products of both reactions, the mixture contains:
  1. (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a single chiral diastereomer with two stereocenters).
  2. meso-2,4-pentanediol (an achiral compound).

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separation is based on polarity. The two products are structurally distinct and have different polarities.
   - **Peaks**: 2 (one for (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for meso-2,4-pentanediol).

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separation is based on chirality. 
   - (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single chiral diastereomer, so it elutes as a single peak.
   - meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral and does not interact with the chiral stationary phase, so it also elutes as a single peak.
   - **Peaks**: 2 (one for (R,S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and one for meso-2,4-pentanediol).

### Conclusion:
The analysis predicts 2 peaks in both normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning and the closest match to the expected outcome, **Option D (3 peaks in both)** is selected as the answer, despite the inconsistency with the detailed analysis.

Answer: D
