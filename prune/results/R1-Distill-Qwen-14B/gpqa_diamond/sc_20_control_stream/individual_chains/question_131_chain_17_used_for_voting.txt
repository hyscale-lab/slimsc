Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR spectroscopy isn't my strongest suit. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: in the 1H spectrum, there's a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, I remember that in 13C NMR, carbonyl carbons like those in anhydrides usually appear around 165-200 ppm. The 137 ppm might be an sp² carbon, maybe part of the double bond.

Wait, the anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR. That suggests that all hydrogens in the molecule are equivalent. So, perhaps it's a symmetrical anhydride. Because a dicarboxylic acid would lose two water molecules when dehydrating, forming an anhydride. If the starting acid has a cis-alkene, the anhydride might have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are symmetrically placed around the double bond.

Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. I know that cyclopentadiene is a diene and can undergo Diels-Alder reactions with dienophiles. Anhydrides are good dienophiles. So, when the anhydride reacts with the diene, a Diels-Alder adduct forms. But wait, the question says it yields two products, major and minor. Maybe because there are two possible diastereomers or the reaction can proceed through different transition states?

The products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. Let's see: the anhydride would contribute some carbons and oxygens, and the diene contributes the rest. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, so its formula is C9H12. The anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(something)-COOH. Dehydration would form an anhydride O=C-(something)-C=O, but in a cyclic form. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a singlet at 7 ppm. In the 1H NMR, a peak around 7 ppm usually corresponds to aromatic protons. But wait, anhydrides can have neighboring groups, maybe. Alternatively, if the anhydride is cyclic, perhaps the protons near the carbonyl are deshielded. But wait, if the peak is a singlet, perhaps it's a pair of equivalent protons, like in a symmetric environment. Or maybe it's a geminal di-substitution? Or maybe it's a bridge structure.

Alternatively, maybe the protons on the alkene are showing up at 7 ppm? Wait, the alkene in the starting material is cis, but upon dehydration, maybe it's converted into a trans structure. Or perhaps the anhydride's structure makes the alkene protons equivalent?

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a single peak, which could be due to symmetry. So, if the anhydride has a structure where the two carbonyl groups are symmetrical, perhaps the alkene is in the middle, making the two protons equivalent. For example, like maleic anhydride, which has a structure where the two carbonyl groups are on either end of a double bond, making the protons equivalent. The 1H NMR of maleic anhydride shows a singlet for the two equivalent protons on the double bond. So that fits with the data given here.

So, the anhydride is likely something like maleic anhydride. Let's move on.

The reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: in the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (anhydride) react to form a six-membered cyclic adduct with two substituents from each reactant.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So, the cyclopentadiene rings have methyl groups on all four positions. So, the structure is:

      CH2CH2
      C   C
       \ /
CH2   C   C   CH2
       / \
  CH3   CH3

Wait, maybe it's:

The cyclopentadiene has five-membered ring with double bonds at 1,3 positions. All four positions (1, 2, 3, 4) have methyl groups. So, each of the double bonds (1-2 and 3-4) is substituted with methyl groups. So, when it reacts in Diels-Alder, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition, the diene would be the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is the anhydride.

So, the Diels-Alder adduct would form a six-membered ring, with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

But wait, the reaction forms two products, major and minor. That makes me think about exo and endo transition states. The endo rule states that the more substituted (endo) product is formed more favorably. So, the major product would be the endo transition state product, and the minor would be the exo.

Now, the NMR data for the products: both have the same molecular formula. The NOESY spectra show a cross-peak for the major product but not the minor. NOESY detects through-space interactions, not through-bond. So, if two protons are close in space, there's a cross-peak. So in the major product, which is the endo adduct, certain protons are closer together.

In the major product, which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak? The options give various possibilities.

Let me think about the structure of the adduct. The Diels-Alder adduct of maleic anhydride and a diene would have the substituents from the anhydride (the carbonyl groups) on the endo positions, and the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile's substituents (like the carbonyl groups) end up on the same face as the diene's substituents. So, the endo transition state leads to the substituents being on the same face, which can lead to specific NOE interactions.

In the major product (endo), the substituents (like methyl groups) from the diene and the dienophile's substituents (like the oxygen from the anhydride) would be on the same face of the ring. So, in the product, perhaps the bridgehead protons or certain substituent protons are close, leading to a NOE interaction.

Looking at the options, they describe different pairs of resonances.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. So perhaps a set of methyl groups and a proton somewhere else. Maybe the methyl groups are from the cyclopentadiene, and the 1H is a bridge proton.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H could be three equivalent methyl groups (so 3 groups x 2H each?), but that doesn't add up. Wait, 6H could be three methyl groups (each 2H), but that's not possible. Wait, no, each methyl group is 3H. So 6H would need two methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. That would imply two sets of equivalent methyl groups. Maybe the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene are split into two environments. For example, the endo product might have some methyl groups closer to the oxygen, causing a different environment.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H could be from an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or an ester. The doublet at 1.5 could be a proton next to a branching.

Wait, but the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY suggests that two protons are close in space. So, which two groups would have their protons near each other?

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state would position the substituents on the same face. So, the methyl groups from the diene and the groups from the dienophile (like the oxygen from the anhydride) would be on the same face.

But in the adduct structure, the bridge substituents from the dienophile (like the anhydride's oxygen) and the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face, leading to certain protons being close.

Wait, perhaps the two methyl groups from the diene (on carbons 2 and 3 of the cyclopentadiene) end up being adjacent in the adduct, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-peak connects a methyl group on the bridgehead to another proton that's on the same face.

Wait, perhaps the product has a bicyclic structure. When the Diels-Alder forms, the adduct could have a bridge, and the substituents (like the dienophile's oxygen) would be on the bridge.

So, the NOE cross-peak connects a methyl group (which is deshielded or in a certain environment) to another proton that's adjacent in space.

Alternatively, perhaps the two methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene that are on adjacent carbons in the diene end up being on the same face in the adduct, leading to the protons being close. Or maybe a methyl group is near an axial proton on the bridge.

Wait, but how does this relate to the NMR signals? Let's look at the options.

Option A: 6H singlet (maybe three equivalent methyl groups) and a 1H doublet. If the 1H is a bridgehead proton, and the 6H are methyl groups attached to another part, maybe they are close in space. But why a doublet? The bridgehead proton might have neighboring protons. Alternatively, perhaps the 1H is part of an axial position.

Option B: 6H at 1.7 ppm (maybe two methyl groups, each 3H), and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 2H could be from an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether. Wait, but in the Diels-Alder adduct, the dienophile becomes part of the six-membered ring. The anhydride would become a part of the ring as an ester or ketone? Or more accurately, the anhydride would form a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder reaction adds the dienophile (like maleic anhydride) to the diene, forming a bicyclic structure. The product would have the structure where the dienophile's carbonyl oxygens are now part of the ring as ester groups.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclo structure with two ester groups. The endo adduct would have the substituents on the same face, making certain protons close.

So, in the major product, perhaps the bridgehead has a substituent that is close to a methyl group from the diene. For example, a methyl group on the same face as the bridgehead substituent (like an oxygen) would have protons in close proximity, leading to a NOE cross-peak.

But wait, the cross-peak is between a 6H singlet and another group. Let me think: 6H singlet could be three equivalent methyl groups. Alternatively, two groups of 3H each.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So, in the adduct, each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) of the diene has a methyl group. But upon Diels-Alder reaction, the diene's substituents (the methyl groups) would be incorporated into the six-membered ring.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, two of the methyl groups (from the diene) would be at the end of the new six-membered ring, and the other two would be attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, perhaps in the structure, the substituents (methyl groups) are in positions that may be on the same face as the bridge substituent.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NOE cross-peak. It occurs between two protons that are close in space. So, in the major product, perhaps a methyl group is close to another proton that's part of an oxygen-containing group.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So two sets of 6H each. That might not make sense because the molecular formula is C13H16O3. The diene contributes 9 carbons (C9H12), the anhydride contributing 4 carbons (since the dicarboxylic acid would lose two water molecules, so the anhydride would be, say, HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH → O=C-(CH2)n-C=O as an anhydride. Wait, but for the reaction, the anhydride is reacting as the dienophile, which is four carbons (like maleic anhydride is four carbons). So, the product would have 9 (dien) +4 (anhydride) =13 carbons, which matches.

So, in the product, the substituents from the diene are the four methyl groups. But in the adduct, the diene's structure becomes a six-membered ring. The substituents (methyl groups) would be at specific positions.

In the endo product, the substituents (like the methyl groups) and the dienophile's substituents (like the oxygen bridge) are on the same face. So, the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face as the bridge.

So, maybe a methyl group from the diene is near the bridge, leading to a NOE interaction between the methyl protons and a proton adjacent to the bridge.

Wait, but the cross-peak connects two resonances, so perhaps a set of methyl protons (6H singlet) are close to a single proton (1H doublet at 1.5 ppm) or a 2H singlet.

Wait, maybe the 6H singlet is from three equivalent methyl groups. Or perhaps it's two methyl groups each contributing three protons, but that sums to six. Alternatively, maybe it's three methyl groups each with two protons, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from a cyclopropane ring or some other structure, but that's a stretch.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The dienophile (anhydride) would form an ester group in the adduct. The endo transition state would position these ester groups close to the diene's substituents.

So, perhaps in the major product, the two ester groups (from the anhydride) are on the same face as the methyl groups from the diene. This could lead to some protons being close in space.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead in the adduct has substituents (like the ester oxygen) that are near certain methyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about the NOE cross-peak. If the cross-peak is present in the major product, that suggests that two protons are close in space, which likely means they're on adjacent carbons or in a close arrangement.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet. The singlet suggests no neighboring protons, so that group is likely a set of equivalent protons, like methyl groups. The doublet implies two neighboring protons. So perhaps the 1H is a bridgehead proton, and the 6H are methyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Option B: 6H at 1.7 ppm (maybe another set of methyl groups) and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 2H singlet might be from an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or an ester. Maybe the 2H are part of a CH2 group next to an oxygen.

Option C: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. This would imply two distinct sets of six equivalent protons. But I'm not sure how that would happen in the product.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So, a single proton and a pair of equivalent protons. The doublet suggests coupling with another proton, perhaps a neighboring CH2 group.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize the Diels-Alder adduct.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. When it reacts with maleic anhydride (the dienophile), the product (endo) would have the substituents (methyl groups and the anhydride groups) on the same face.

The product would be a bicyclic structure with the two ester groups from the anhydride. The methyl groups from the diene would be attached to the new six-membered ring.

In the endo product, perhaps the methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of the diene end up being on the same face as the bridge oxygen, leading to some proximity.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead has an oxygen group (from the anhydride), and a methyl group is adjacent to it. So, the methyl protons would be close to the bridgehead protons.

Alternatively, maybe the bridgehead has a CH2 group, and a methyl group is close by, leading to their protons being close in space.

Wait, but the cross-peak is between which two groups? Let me think about the possible coupling.

If the major product has a cross-peak between a 6H singlet and, say, a 1H doublet, that 1H might be a bridgehead proton. The bridgehead is a quaternary carbon, so maybe it's a CH group. Wait, but in the adduct, the bridgehead would be a carbon with four bonds. Let's see: the Diels-Alder adduct forms a six-membered ring, with two carbons from the dienophile and four from the diene. The bridge would involve two of these carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead has a CH2 group, and a methyl group is attached nearby. So the CH2 group would have protons that are next to the methyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures and the NOE effect.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state places the substituents on the same face. So, any substituents on the diene (like methyl groups) and the dienophile (like the anhydride's oxygen) are on the same side. Thus, in the major product, the substituents from both reactants are on the same face, leading to certain protons being close.

If a methyl group is on one face, and a bridgehead substituent (like an oxygen) is on the same face, the methyl protons may be close to the bridgehead protons.

But the bridgehead is a carbon with two substituents from the dienophile. For example, the bridgehead would be a carbon attached to two carbonyl groups (from the anhydride) as esters.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead carbon is connected to two ester groups. So, the bridgehead would have two oxygen atoms attached via ester linkages. Then, the adjacent carbon would have the methyl group from the diene.

So, the methyl group attached to, say, carbon 1 of the diene would be next to the bridgehead (carbon 6 of the adduct). Therefore, the protons on the methyl group would be close to the bridgehead, but the bridgehead itself may not have any protons. Wait, bridgehead carbons are usually quaternary, so they don't have protons. So, the bridgehead wouldn't contribute any protons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another approach: the NOE cross-peak in the major product suggests that two groups of protons are close. Let's think about the options.

Option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet.
Option B: 6H at 1.7 ppm and 2H at 3.5 ppm.
Option C: 6H at 1 and 6H at 1.7.
Option D: 1H at 1.5 and 2H at 3.5.

In the product, the methyl groups from the diene might be at different environments, leading to different shifts. For example, some methyl groups are closer to electron-withdrawing groups (like the ester oxygen), causing downfield shifts. Others might be more shielded.

If the major product has a cross-peak between a methyl group and another proton, perhaps the methyl is near a proton that's part of the bridge or another substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H singlet is from the cyclopentadiene methyl groups. Wait, but when the diene reacts, the four methyl groups are part of the structure. Depending on their positions, two of them might be equivalent and give a 6H singlet, but that's only if they're in the same environment.

Wait, but each methyl group is a triplet of 3H. So, if two methyl groups are equivalent, their 3H each would add up to 6H. If they're in the same environment, their signals would overlap into a singlet.

So, perhaps in the major product, two methyl groups are equivalent, giving a 6H singlet. Then, another group of protons, perhaps a 1H doublet, is close to these methyl groups.

Wait, but a 1H doublet would mean it's split by one neighboring proton. So, perhaps it's a CH with two adjacent CH2 groups or something like that.

Alternatively, the 2H singlet in option B could be from an oxygen-bearing CH2 group. For example, if the adduct has an oxygen in the ring, there might be an adjacent CH2 group. The 2H singlet would imply that the two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let's think about the major and minor products. The minor product isn't showing the cross-peak, which suggests that in the minor product, those two protons aren't close, maybe because of a different stereochemistry.

Wait, the endo product would have the substituents on the same face, leading to proximity, whereas the exo product would have substituents on opposite faces, reducing the proximity.

So, in the major product (endo), the NOE cross-peak exists because the two groups are on the same face, whereas in the minor (exo), the groups are on opposite faces, so no cross-peak.

So, the cross-peak connects a set of protons that are in proximity due to the endo arrangement.

If the cross-peak is between a 6H singlet and another group, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three equivalent methyl groups. Wait, but each methyl group is 3H, so 6H would be two methyl groups. But two methyl groups would each be 3H, so a singlet of 6H would imply two equivalent methyl groups. So perhaps in the product, two methyl groups are in the same environment, giving a 6H singlet.

The other group could be a single proton (like a bridgehead CH) that's doublet. But bridgeheads are usually quaternary carbons, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the 6H could be from the three methyl groups attached to the same carbon. For example, maybe a carbon with three methyl groups attached, but that would be a 9H singlet, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the possible structures again.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. When it reacts with the anhydride, the product is a bicyclic structure, perhaps with two ester groups from the anhydride.

In the major product (endo), the substituents from the diene (methyl groups) are on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile (the oxygen bridge). So, the methyl groups are near the bridge, which has oxygen substituents.

If a methyl group is near a proton that's part of the oxygen bridge, their protons would be close, leading to a NOE effect.

Wait, but the oxygen bridge itself doesn't have protons. So, perhaps the protons are on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, the bridge might have a CH2 group adjacent to the ester oxygen. So, the CH2 group's protons would be near the methyl groups from the diene.

In that case, the CH2 protons would show up as a singlet if equivalent, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but the options include a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, which would deshield the protons, causing a downfield shift. The 1.7 ppm singlet could be methyl groups. So, if the 2H are from a CH2 next to oxygen, and the 6H are from methyl groups, perhaps these are connected through space.

Alternatively, the 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm could be a proton adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the 6H at 1.7 ppm are methyl groups adjacent to the bridge, and the 2H at 3.5 ppm are a CH2 group near the oxygen. If these two groups are on the same face (endo), their protons might be close, leading to a cross-peak in the major product.

So, in the major product, the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (CH2 near oxygen) might be close, leading to the NOE cross-peak.

Alternatively, if the 6H are from a set of methyl groups and the 2H are from a CH2, then the cross-peak would be between them if they're spatially close.

Looking at the options, option B says a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So, this would imply that those two groups are near each other in the major product.

In the minor product (exo), these groups would be on opposite faces, so the NOE cross-peak would be absent or weak.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. So, if one group is a 6H and another is a 1H, they're near each other.

But why would a 1H be a doublet? Perhaps it's a methine (CH) group with two neighboring protons. Or a bridgehead proton coupled to another proton.

Wait, but bridgehead protons are usually not present because the bridgehead is a quaternary carbon. So, maybe the 1H is part of a CH group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1H doublet is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to coupling.

Hmm, I'm still a bit stuck, but I'm starting to think that the correct answer is option B: a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet.

Wait, no, wait. Option B is a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. Option A is a 6H and a 1H doublet.

Wait, maybe the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups, but that would be 9H. No, that's not possible. So 6H must be two methyl groups (each 3H), but why would two methyl groups be equivalent? Perhaps because they're on symmetric positions in the molecule.

In the major product, two methyl groups from the diene are on the same face as the bridge, leading to their protons being in the same environment, giving a 6H singlet. The 2H singlet could be a CH2 group attached to the oxygen, which is also on the same face, leading them to be close.

So, in the major product, the 6H (two methyl groups) and the 2H (CH2) are close, giving a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.

Therefore, the correct option would be B: a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Wait, but wait! Let me check the options again.

Option B says: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So, if those two groups are close in the major product, that makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2H singlet is from a CH2 group adjacent to the ester oxygen, which would be deshielded, so around 3.5 ppm.

So, I'll go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of a dicarboxylic acid-derived anhydride with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major (endo) and a minor (exo). The major product exhibits a NOESY cross-peak between two resonances, while the minor product does not. The task is to identify which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**: The anhydride is symmetric, as indicated by the single peak in its $^1$H NMR spectrum (7 ppm) and two peaks in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This suggests the anhydride is likely similar to maleic anhydride, with a symmetrical structure.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**: The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (diene) forms a bicyclic adduct. The major product corresponds to the endo transition state, where substituents (methyl groups from the diene and oxygen atoms from the anhydride) are on the same face of the ring. The minor product corresponds to the exo transition state, where these groups are on opposite faces.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**: The NOESY spectrum detects through-space interactions between protons. In the major product (endo), the substituents are on the same face, leading to proximity between certain protons. This proximity results in a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum, which is absent or weak in the minor product (exo).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. The 6H singlet could represent equivalent methyl groups, but the 1H doublet does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet likely corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, while the 2H singlet could represent a CH$_2$ group adjacent to an oxygen atom. These groups are spatially close in the endo product, making this option plausible.
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This would require two distinct sets of six equivalent protons, which is unlikely given the molecular structure of the product.
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 1H doublet suggests coupling with another proton, but this arrangement does not align with the expected spatial proximity in the major product.

5. **Conclusion**: The major product's NOESY cross-peak is best explained by the spatial proximity of the 6H singlet (likely two equivalent methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (likely a CH$_2$ group near an oxygen atom) in the endo configuration.

ANSWER: B
