Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I remember that p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. So two electrons are each in a p orbital state. But wait, the question says to ignore their spin angular momentum, so I can focus just on the orbital part.

The problem gives a coupled angular momentum state as |1,1,2,-1>. Let me parse that. The first two numbers are l1 and l2, both 1, so each electron is in a p orbital. Then l is 2, which is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. And m is -1, which is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

Wait, but how does that state vector break down into the individual states? Oh right, I think when you have two particles, the total angular momentum is the sum of their individual angular momenta. So for two p electrons, l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l's can be l=2, 1, or 0. Because when adding angular momenta, the maximum is l1 + l2, and it decreases by 1 each time.

So the state given is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. I need to find the joint probability that measuring L1z and L2z both yield -ħ. Since each Lz has eigenvalues mħ, so m would be -1 for each if L1z and L2z are each measured to be -ħ.

Wait, but each electron's individual state contributes to the total. Let me think. Each L1z and L2z are the individual z-components of their respective angular momenta. So for particle 1, L1z eigenvalue is m1 * ħ, and for particle 2, m2 * ħ. We're looking for the case where both m1 and m2 are -1. So their product would be (m1 * ħ) and (m2 * ħ), and each would be -ħ.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. How does that relate to m1 and m2? The m for the total state is the sum of m1 and m2. So m_total = m1 + m2. In this case, m_total is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

We are to find the probability that m1=-1 and m2=-1, meaning their sum is -2. But wait, the total m is given as -1. So if m1=-1 and m2=-1, their sum would be -2, which doesn't match the given m=-1. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, that can't happen. So that's impossible. So the joint probability of both being -ħ would be zero because the sum would have to be -2, but the state has m=-1. Therefore, the probability is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the expansion of the coupled state into the product basis. The coupled state |l1,l2, l, m> can be expressed as a linear combination of |l1, m1> |l2, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m_total.

So for the given state, we have l=2 (so maximum m is 2, and the state is m=-1). The state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

Each term in the sum would correspond to a particular (m1, m2) pair. The question is whether the pair (m1=-1, m2=-1) is present in this sum. Because m1 + m2 = -2 in that case, which is not equal to -1. So this particular (m1, m2) pair isn't part of the state.

So when you measure L1z and L2z, and you get m1=-1 and m2=-1, their sum is -2, which would imply the total m is -2, but the state given has m=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where m1=-1 and m2=-1. Therefore, the probability is zero.

So the correct answer should be option D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where the coupled angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and its z-component, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are $m_1 \hbar$ and $m_2 \hbar$, respectively. For both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to yield $-\hbar$, it must be that $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The total z-component of angular momentum is $m = m_1 + m_2$. In this case, $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the given $m = -1$ in the state $|1,1,2,-1>$. 

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. Since $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ would result in $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, this particular combination is not part of the given state. Therefore, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where the coupled angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and its z-component, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are $m_1 \hbar$ and $m_2 \hbar$, respectively. For both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to yield $-\hbar$, it must be that $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The total z-component of angular momentum is $m = m_1 + m_2$. In this case, $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the given $m = -1$ in the state $|1,1,2,-1>$. 

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. Since $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ would result in $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, this particular combination is not part of the given state. Therefore, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.
