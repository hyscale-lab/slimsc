Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about a spacecraft traveling at an extremely high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens are from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they want to reach Earth. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Hmm, right. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) will be different from the time measured in the Earth's frame of reference.

Wait, so the question is about the astronaut's experienced time. So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey from their perspective.

First, I'll need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance, but I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Yeah, I remember that it's one of the closest galaxies but still way far away. So the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years.

The spacecraft's speed is given as 0.99999987*c. That's really close to the speed of light. So in terms of fractions, maybe I can approximate it as 0.9999999*c, but the exact value might matter for precise calculations.

Wait, but for the sake of this problem, maybe the exact distance isn't as important because the options are in terms of decades. So perhaps the calculation will show that the time experienced by the astronaut is significantly less than the time it would take from Earth's perspective.

Wait, let's think about the time dilation formula. The proper time τ (tau) is related to the time t in the Earth frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but wait, no—actually, the time experienced by the traveler is shorter. So the formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, t = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because from Earth's frame, the time t is longer than the proper time.

Wait, no. Let's get this straight. The proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. So, the proper time τ is the time measured in the moving frame (the spacecraft), while the Earth time t is measured in the stationary frame.

So, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving at v, so the time for the trip is t = D / v, where D is the distance. Then, the astronaut's proper time τ is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, since the spacecraft is moving at a high velocity, the distance will be length contracted in their frame. So from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is shorter. So, the distance D' is D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the time τ would be D' / v. Which would be (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Wait, yeah, that's another approach. So, I can compute τ in two ways. Either by using the Earth's frame measurements and applying time dilation, or by using the contracted distance and the astronaut's frame.

Let me try the first approach: calculate t from Earth's perspective, then multiply by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) to get the proper time.

Wait, but distance is a spatial measurement, so perhaps the second approach is better. Let me see.

So, the distance between the LMC and Earth is D = 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987 c.

So the time from Earth's perspective is t = D / v.

Let me compute that. Since D is in light-years and v is a fraction of c, the time t would be in years.

So, D = 163,000 ly, v = 0.99999987 c.

t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ ?

Well, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so t is approximately 163,000 / 1 = 163,000 years. But because v is a tiny bit less than c, the time would be a bit longer than 163,000 years.

Wait, let's compute 163,000 / 0.99999987.

0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013. So 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1 + 0.00000013 (using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x for small x). So t ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 0.00000013. The second term is 163,000 * 1.3e-7 = approx 0.02119. So t ≈ 163,000.021 years.

But that's a very small difference. So from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000 years.

But that's from Earth's perspective. The astronaut's proper time would be shorter. So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Compute sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v = 0.99999987 c, so v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ let's compute that. (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 0.99999974, because 2*(1.3e-7) is 2.6e-7. So 1 - 2.6e-7 ≈ 0.99999974. Wait, but wait, (a - b)^2 is a^2 - 2ab + b^2. So, 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1-2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14) ≈ approximately 0.99999974, since the last term is negligible.

So sqrt(0.99999974) ≈ ?

We can approximate sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x.

Here, x is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 / 2 = 1 - 0.00000013.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 0.99999974. Let's represent it as 1 - δ, where δ=0.00000026.

We need sqrt(1-δ) ≈ sqrt(1 - δ) ≈ 1 - (δ)/2 - (δ²)/(8) - ... 

So for small δ, the approximation is about 1 - δ/2.

So sqrt(1-0.00000026) ≈ 1 - 0.00000013 = 0.99999987.

Wait, that's interesting. So sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) is approximately 0.99999987, same as v/c. Wait, that can't be, can it? Because v is 0.99999987 c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 c²/c² = (0.9999997408) approximately.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - 0.9999997408) = sqrt(0.0000002592) ≈ sqrt(2.592e-7) ≈ let's compute that.

The square root of 2.592e-7: sqrt(2.592e-7) is about sqrt(2.592)*1e-3.5, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2.592e-7 is 2.592 *10^-7. The square root of 10^-7 is 10^-3.5, which is about 3.162e-4. The square root of 2.592 is approximately 1.61 (since 1.6^2 =2.56, 1.61^2≈2.5921). So the sqrt is approximately 1.61 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically. Let me think about it:

2.592e-7 = 0.0000002592.

What's the square root of that number?

Well, sqrt(2.592e-7) = sqrt(2.592) * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.001 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-4.

So sqrt(2.592) is approx 1.61, so 1.61 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.000509.

So that's the gamma factor's reciprocal, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1/0.000509 ≈ 1968. So gamma is about 1968.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate it accurately.

So, let's compute 0.99999987 c: v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612.

1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.000509.

So gamma is 1 / 0.000509 ≈ 1968. So approximately, gamma is about 1968.

So, tau = t / gamma.

Wait, no. Wait, the proper time tau is the time in the spaceship's frame. So, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t * 0.000509.

But wait, t is about 163,000 years from Earth's perspective. So tau = 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.000509 is approximately 5.09e-4.

163,000 * 5.09e-4 = let's compute 163,000 * 5.09e-4.

163,000 * 5e-4 = 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163,000 * 0.000009 = 1.467.

So 81.5 + 1.467 ≈ 82.967 years.

So, tau is approximately 83 years.

Wait, but wait, I approximated gamma as 1968, and then tau = t / gamma.

Wait, no, t is in Earth's frame. So, tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ 82.967 years. So about 83 years.

But wait, that can't be right because the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. So 83 is not an option, but the closest is 81, which is option C. But wait, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, another approach: calculate the Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.99999987 c.

Compute v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974080809.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974080809 = 0.00000025919191.

sqrt(0.00000025919191) ≈ let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute 0.00000025919191.

That's 2.5919191e-7.

sqrt(2.5919191e-7) = sqrt(2.5919191) * 1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.5919191) is approximately 1.61, because 1.61^2=2.5921, which is very close to 2.5919191.

So sqrt ≈ 1.61.

1e-3.5 is 3.16227766e-4.

So 1.61 * 3.16227766e-4 ≈ 5.090e-4.

So gamma is 1 / (5.090e-4) ≈ 1964.29.

Wait, that's more precise. So gamma ≈ 1964.29.

So Earth time t = D / v.

D is 163,000 ly, v = 0.99999987 c.

t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987).

Earlier, I approximated 1/0.99999987 as 1.00000013, but let's be precise.

Actually, 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + x^3 + ... So for x=1.3e-7, approx 1.3e-7 is very small, so 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x + x². x² is negligible, so approx 1 + 1.3e-7.

So t ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7.

163,000 * 1.3e-7 = 163,000 * 1.3 * 1e-7 = (163,000 * 1.3) * 1e-7.

163,000 *1.3 = 211,900.

211,900 * 1e-7 = 0.02119.

So t ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.02119 years.

Now, the proper time tau = t / gamma.

t is 163,000.02119 years; gamma is approx 1964.29.

So tau ≈ 163,000.02119 / 1964.29 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division.

Approximately, 163,000 / 1964 ≈ let's see.

Well, 1964 * 83 = ?

1964 *80 = 157,120.

1964 *3=5,892.

So 157,120 +5,892=163,012.

So 1964 *83 = 163,012.

But our numerator is 163,000.02119, which is a bit less than 163,012.

So 163,000.02119 ≈ 83 *1964 - (163,012 -163,000.02119) = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 163,000 / 1964.29.

So 163,000 / 1964.29 = ?

Let me compute 1964.29 *83 = 1964 *83 + 0.29 *83.

1964 *83 = (2000-36)*83 = 2000*83=166,000, minus 36*83=2,988 → 166,000 -2,988 =163,012.

0.29 *83 = approx 24.07.

So total is 163,012 +24.07 =163,036.07.

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to find what 1964.29 multiplied by what gives me 163,000.

Wait, perhaps I can approach it as 163,000 = 1964.29 * x → x = 163000 / 1964.29 ≈ 83.0.

Wait, but wait 1964.29 *83 = 163,012 as before. So 163,012 is larger than 163,000 by about 12. So 83 would give 163,012, which is 12 more than 163,000.

So x is 83 - (12/1964.29) → 83 - approx 0.0061 → x≈82.9939.

So, 163,000 /1964.29 ≈82.994 years.

So tau ≈82.994 years, which is about 83 years.

But the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. So 83 is not an option, but option C is 81, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximations are leading me astray.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the distance from the LMC to Earth is more accurately about 160,000 light-years. Wait, I thought it was about 163,000, but perhaps 160,000 is a better approximation.

Wait, let me double-check: the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. So I think my initial assumption is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that the speed is so close to c that the time from the astronaut's perspective is D/(v gamma), where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, maybe another approach is to calculate the distance as being length-contracted from the astronaut's perspective. Because from their frame, the distance is shorter by a factor of gamma.

So, D' = D / gamma.

So D' = 163,000 ly / 1964.29 ≈ 163,000 / 1964.29 ≈ 83 light-years.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v.

v is 0.99999987 c.

So, D' =83 ly.

Time τ = D' / v = 83 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 83 / 0.99999987 years.

Which is approximately 83 * (1/0.99999987) ≈83 *1.00000013≈83.0001 years.

So again, about 83 years.

Hmm, but none of the options is 83. The closest is option C) 81 years.

So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in either the distance or the speed.

Wait, the speed is given as 0.99999987 c, which is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. So that's 99.999987% the speed of light.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Lorentz factor more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with a different approach, such as using the approximation for v very close to c.

Wait, when v is very close to c, gamma is approximately c/(c-v), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that gamma is approximately 1/(sqrt(2*(1-v/c))), but that's not correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the consideration of the average lifetime of the aliens being 150 solar years. Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So, from Earth's perspective, they are 150 years old, but from their perspective, they'd age less. Wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time. So if the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, their age would be 22 +83=105, which is less than 150, so they'd survive.

But the options are about the time taken, not the age. So the time is about 83 years, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the distance is 160,000 ly. Let me recalculate with D=160,000 ly.

t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 *1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.208 years.

gamma is 1964.29.

tau = t_earth / gamma = 160,000.208 /1964.29 ≈ approx 81.3 years.

Ah, that's closer to 81 years, which is option C.

So perhaps the distance is approximately 160,000 ly, leading to about 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is 170,000 ly. Let me try with D=170,000.

t_earth = 170,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 *1.00000013 ≈ 170,000.221 years.

tau = 170,000.221 / 1964.29 ≈ approx 86.5 years.

That's not matching any option.

Hmm, maybe the problem uses a different distance. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, let me compute gamma with more precision.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = (1 -1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.5919191e-7.

Now, gamma is 1/ sqrt(2.5919191e-7) ≈ 1/ (5.090e-4) ≈1964.29.

But perhaps with more precise calculation, gamma is 1964.29. So tau = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth is D/(v) = D/(0.99999987 c) = D/(0.99999987) * (1 ly) / (c) * years. Since D is in light-years, t_earth is D/(v) in years.

So, with D=163,000 ly, t_earth is 163000 /0.99999987 ≈163000.021 years.

Tau = 163000.021 / 1964.29 ≈83.0 years.

But the options don't have 83. The closest option is C)81.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that for v ≈ c, gamma ≈ D/(v * tau).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula again.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = (D' )/v, where D' is the contracted distance.

D' = D / gamma.

So, tau = (D / gamma) / v = D/(gamma * v).

But since v is approximately c, gamma*v ≈ gamma c.

So, tau = D/(gamma c).

But D is in light-years, so D/(c) is the time in years for light to travel that distance.

Wait, so D/(c) is the time in years. So, tau = (D / gamma) /v = (D/(gamma)) * (1/v) = D/(gamma * v). Since v≈c, this becomes D/(gamma *c) = (D/c) / gamma.

But D/c is the time for light to travel, which is the distance in light-years, so D/c is D ly / c = D years.

Wait, so tau = D/(gamma * c) = D/(gamma * c) = (D/c) / gamma → D is in light-years, so D/c is D years. So tau = D / gamma.

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier analysis showed that tau is t_earth / gamma.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the approximation that for v ≈ c, gamma ≈ D / (v * tau).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for time dilation directly.

But I think the proper way is to compute tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Which with t_earth = D /v, and D=163,000 ly.

So, tau= (163,000 / 0.99999987 ) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

Which is (163,000.021) * (0.000509) ≈ 82.97 years.

So about 83 years.

But since the options don't include 83, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 170,000 ly. Let me compute with D=170,000.

tau = (170,000 /0.99999987 ) * 0.000509 ≈ (170,000.221) * 0.000509 ≈ 170,000 *0.000509 ≈86.53 years.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 150,000 light-years.

tau = 150,000 *0.000509 ≈76.35 years. So about 76 years. Closest option is D)77.

But my initial assumption was D=163,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approximation.

Wait another thought: perhaps using the approximation that for v very close to c, gamma ≈ (c)/(c-v).

Wait, v =0.99999987 c → c-v=1.3e-7 c.

gamma ≈ c/(c-v) → 1/(1.3e-7) ≈7.69e6. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gives gamma as about 1964.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation that for v close to c, gamma ≈ 1/(sqrt(2*(1-v/c))).

Wait, let's compute 1-v/c = 1-0.99999987= 1.3e-7.

So sqrt(2*(1.3e-7)) = sqrt(2.6e-7)= approx 5.099e-4.

So gamma ≈1/5.099e-4 ≈1960.

Which is similar to the earlier value of gamma=1964.29.

So, with gamma=1960, and D=163,000 ly:

t_earth=163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000.021 years.

tau=163,000.021 /1960 ≈83.17 years.

So still around 83 years.

So the problem must have a different figure for the distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed as 0.999999c, which would change things.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.999999c, not 0.99999987c. Let's see.

If v=0.999999c, then v²/c² = (0.999999)^2 = 0.999998.

So 1 -v²/c² =2e-6.

sqrt(2e-6) = sqrt(2)*1e-3 ≈1.4142e-3.

So gamma=1/(1.4142e-3) ≈707.1.

So then for D=163,000 ly.

t_earth=163,000 /0.999999 ≈163,000 *1.000001 ≈163,000.163 years.

tau=163,000.163 /707.1 ≈230.5 years.

But that's way beyond the astronaut's lifetime of 150 years. So the astronaut would die before reaching Earth.

But the options don't have that with the given speed in the problem.

Wait, but the initial speed in the problem is 0.99999987c, so very close to c.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to be done with the approximation that when v is extremely close to c, gamma is approximately (1e8) or something, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the approximation that for v=0.99999987c, the time experienced is roughly D / (v * gamma), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the time as D/(v * gamma), where gamma is about 1964, so D=163,000 ly.

So D/(v gamma) = 163,000 / (0.99999987 *1964) ≈163,000/(1964) ≈83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the astronaut's experienced time is D/(v * gamma), but wait, D is in light-years, v is in terms of c (so in ly/year), so D/(v) is time in years, then multiplied by sqrt(1 -v²/c²), which is 1/gamma.

So tau = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * (1/gamma) ) = D/(v gamma).

Which is the same as D/(v gamma) = D/(gamma v).

But since v is close to c, gamma is about 1964, v is 0.99999987, so gamma v ≈1964 *0.99999987 ≈1964.

So, tau= D/(gamma) ≈163,000 /1964 ≈83 years.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)77, but perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is so close to c that the time is approx D/(c) * (1 - (v/c)).

Wait, because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) ≈ t_earth * (1 - v²/(2c²)).

Hmm, perhaps using the approximation sqrt(1-x) ≈1 -x/2 for small x.

So, sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ≈1 - (v²)/(2c²).

So, tau = t_earth * [1 - (v²)/(2c²) ].

t_earth = D/(v) = 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000 years (approx).

Wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so v²/c² is approximately 1, so 1 - (v²)/(2c²) = 1 - (0.99999987^2)/2.

Wait, 0.99999987^2≈0.99999974.

So 1 - 0.99999974/2 = 1 - 0.49999987 = 0.50000013.

So tau ≈163,000 * 0.50000013 ≈81,500 years. No, that's way off. That can't be right.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective.

The distance they travel (in their frame) is contracted by gamma. So the distance is D' = D / gamma.

So, D'=163,000 /1964≈83 ly.

Time taken is D' / v = 83 ly / 0.99999987c ≈83 /0.99999987 years ≈83.0000009 years.

So about 83 years. So the astronaut would experience 83 years.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is given as 170,000 ly.

Wait, no, the problem says the LMC, so I think the actual distance is about 163,000 ly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect some decimal places, leading to an approximate 81 years.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use a calculator, but since I'm doing it manually, let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the gamma factor is computed as 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)).

Compute 0.99999987 squared: let's compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - 0.99999974 =0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = approx 0.0005099.

So gamma is 1/0.0005099 ≈1960.

So tau= t_earth / gamma ≈ (163000 /0.99999987) /1960 ≈ 163000.021/1960≈83.08 years.

Hmm, about 83 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to approximate gamma as 1960, leading to 163000 /1960 ≈83.

But the options don't have 83, so perhaps the intended answer is D)77 years, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the exact speed.

The speed is 0.99999987 c. So, let me compute v²/c² more accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute it precisely.

0.99999987 *0.99999987:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2

=1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

=1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

=0.99999974 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - v²/c²= 1 -0.99999974 -1.69e-14= 0.00000026 -1.69e-14 ≈0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026)= approximately 0.0005099.

So gamma=1/0.0005099≈1960.

So, tau=163000 /1960 ≈83.08 years.

If the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula tau = (D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²)) / v.

Which is same as tau= D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) /v.

So, D=163,000 ly.

sqrt(1 -v²/c²)=0.0005099.

So tau= 163000 *0.0005099 /0.99999987.

Compute numerator: 163000 *0.0005099= 163000 *0.0005=81.5, 163000 *0.0000099=1.6177. Total=83.1177.

Divide by 0.99999987: 83.1177 /0.99999987≈83.1177 *1.00000013≈83.12 years.

Again, 83 years.

But the options don't have 83.

Wait, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B)72

C)81

D)77.

So why is the correct answer not among the options? Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use D=170,000 ly.

But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approach, such as relativistic velocity addition, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is intended to use the gamma factor as approximately 125, leading to tau=163000/125≈130 years, but that's not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the speed is 0.999c, which would give a different gamma.

If v=0.999c, gamma= 22.029.

Then, tau=163,000 /22.029≈7393 years. No, that's way longer than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.998c, gamma=14.86.

Tau=163,000/14.86≈11,000 years. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99c, gamma=7.089.

Tau=163,000/7.089≈23,000 years. Still no.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the time as D/(v) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

D=163,000 ly, v=0.99999987c.

t_earth=163000/0.99999987≈163,000 years.

tau=163000 * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) =163000 *0.0005099≈82.7 years.

So, about 83 years.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation that sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (c^2 -v^2)/(c^2), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the hyperbolic functions approach, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to approximate the time as D/(c) * (1 -v/c), but that seems incorrect.

Wait, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

Which is D/(v) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = D * sqrt( (1 -v²/c²)/v² ) = D * sqrt( (c² -v²)/v² c² ) = D * sqrt( (c²-v²) ) / (v c).

Hmm, perhaps I can compute that.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to note that for such a high speed, the time experienced is so small that the astronaut would die before reaching, but that's not the case here because 83 years is less than the average lifetime of 150 years.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So 83 years later, they would be 105, which is still less than 150. So they would survive.

But option A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. But according to calculation, they would live.

Thus, option A is incorrect.

The options B, C, D are 72,81,77 years.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate gamma with more precise figures.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let me compute it precisely.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

= (1 - 1.3e-7) * (1 -1.3e-7) = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

So 1 -2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 = 0.99999974 + ... So approximately 0.99999974.

Thus, 1 - v²/c²=0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026)= approx 5.099e-4 (as before).

Gamma=1/5.099e-4≈1960.

So tau=163000/(gamma * v/c).

Wait, no, wait: v is 0.99999987c, so v/c=0.99999987.

So tau= (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (163000 /0.99999987) * 5.099e-4.

Compute 163000 /0.99999987= 163000 *1.00000013=163000.2119.

Multiply by 5.099e-4: 163000.2119 *5.099e-4 ≈ let's compute.

163000 *5.099e-4=163000 *0.0005099= 163000 *0.0005=81.5, 163000 *0.0000099≈1.6177. So total ≈83.1177 years.

So, approximately 83.12 years.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. Let me think: perhaps it's 162,000 ly.

Tau=162000/(1960)≈82.6 years.

Still no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses D=160,000 ly.

Tau=160000/1960≈81.63 years.

That's close to 81, which is option C.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

Therefore, the correct answer is C)81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using relativistic time dilation and length contraction principles. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth is approximately \( D = 163,000 \) light-years. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, \( \tau \)) is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \)) due to relativistic effects.

### Key Equations:
1. **Time in Earth's frame**:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v}
   \]
2. **Proper time experienced by the astronaut**:  
   \[
   \tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
3. **Lorentz factor**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Thus, \( \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} \).

### Calculations:
1. **Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}}
   \]
   Approximating \( (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974 \), we find:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099} \approx 1960
   \]

2. **Time in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \))**:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000.021 \, \text{years}
   \]

3. **Proper time (\( \tau \))**:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000.021}{1960} \approx 83.12 \, \text{years}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  The astronaut's average lifetime is 150 years, and the proper time for the journey is approximately 83 years. Since \( 83 < 150 \), the astronaut would survive the trip. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: \( 72 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is significantly lower than the calculated proper time of 83 years. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: \( 81 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is close to the calculated proper time of 83 years. Given potential approximations in the problem, this is the most reasonable choice.

- **Option D**: \( 77 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is also lower than the calculated proper time and less accurate than Option C. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The proper time for the astronaut's journey is approximately 83 years, but since this value is not among the options, the closest match is **Option C: 81 years**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about a spacecraft traveling at an extremely high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens are from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they want to reach Earth. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Hmm, right. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) will be different from the time measured in the Earth's frame of reference.

Wait, so the question is about the astronaut's experienced time. So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey from their perspective.

First, I'll need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance, but I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Yeah, I remember that it's one of the closest galaxies but still way far away. So the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years.

The spacecraft's speed is given as 0.99999987*c. That's really close to the speed of light. So in terms of fractions, maybe I can approximate it as 0.9999999*c, but the exact value might matter for precise calculations.

Wait, but for the sake of this problem, maybe the exact distance isn't as important because the options are in terms of decades. So perhaps the calculation will show that the time experienced by the astronaut is significantly less than the time it would take from Earth's perspective.

Wait, let's think about the time dilation formula. The proper time τ (tau) is related to the time t in the Earth frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but wait, no—actually, the time experienced by the traveler is shorter. So the formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, t = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because from Earth's frame, the time t is longer than the proper time.

Wait, no. Let's get this straight. The proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. So, the proper time τ is the time measured in the moving frame (the spacecraft), while the Earth time t is measured in the stationary frame.

So, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving at v, so the time for the trip is t = D / v, where D is the distance. Then, the astronaut's proper time τ is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, since the spacecraft is moving at a high velocity, the distance will be length contracted in their frame. So from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is shorter. So, the distance D' is D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the time τ would be D' / v. Which would be (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Wait, yeah, that's another approach. So, I can compute τ in two ways. Either by using the Earth's frame measurements and applying time dilation, or by using the contracted distance and the astronaut's frame.

Let me try the first approach: calculate t from Earth's perspective, then multiply by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) to get the proper time.

Wait, but distance is a spatial measurement, so perhaps the second approach is better. Let me see.

So, the distance between the LMC and Earth is D = 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987 c.

So the time from Earth's perspective is t = D / v.

Let me compute that. Since D is in light-years and v is a fraction of c, the time t would be in years.

So, D = 163,000 ly, v = 0.99999987 c.

t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ ?

Well, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so t is approximately 163,000 / 1 = 163,000 years. But because v is a tiny bit less than c, the time would be a bit longer than 163,000 years.

Wait, let's compute 163,000 / 0.99999987.

0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013. So 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1 + 0.00000013 (using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x for small x). So t ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 0.00000013. The second term is 163,000 * 1.3e-7 = approx 0.02119. So t ≈ 163,000.021 years.

But that's a very small difference. So from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000 years.

But that's from Earth's perspective. The astronaut's proper time would be shorter. So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Compute sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v = 0.99999987 c, so v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ let's compute that. (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 0.99999974, because 2*(1.3e-7) is 2.6e-7. So 1 - 2.6e-7 ≈ 0.99999974. Wait, but wait, (a - b)^2 is a^2 - 2ab + b^2. So, 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1-2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14) ≈ approximately 0.99999974, since the last term is negligible.

So sqrt(0.99999974) ≈ ?

We can approximate sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x.

Here, x is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 / 2 = 1 - 0.00000013.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 0.99999974. Let's represent it as 1 - δ, where δ=0.00000026.

We need sqrt(1-δ) ≈ sqrt(1 - δ) ≈ 1 - (δ)/2 - (δ²)/(8) - ... 

So for small δ, the approximation is about 1 - δ/2.

So sqrt(1-0.00000026) ≈ 1 - 0.00000013 = 0.99999987.

Wait, that's interesting. So sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) is approximately 0.99999987, same as v/c. Wait, that can't be, can it? Because v is 0.99999987 c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 c²/c² = (0.9999997408) approximately.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - 0.9999997408) = sqrt(0.0000002592) ≈ sqrt(2.592e-7) ≈ let's compute that.

The square root of 2.592e-7: sqrt(2.592e-7) is about sqrt(2.592)*1e-3.5, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2.592e-7 is 2.592 *10^-7. The square root of 10^-7 is 10^-3.5, which is about 3.162e-4. The square root of 2.592 is approximately 1.61 (since 1.6^2 =2.56, 1.61^2≈2.5921). So the sqrt is approximately 1.61 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically. Let me think about it:

2.592e-7 = 0.0000002592.

What's the square root of that number?

Well, sqrt(2.592e-7) = sqrt(2.592) * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.001 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-4.

So sqrt(2.592) is approx 1.61, so 1.61 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.000509.

So that's the gamma factor's reciprocal, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1/0.000509 ≈ 1968. So gamma is about 1968.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate it accurately.

So, let's compute 0.99999987 c: v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612.

1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.000509.

So gamma is 1 / 0.000509 ≈ 1968. So approximately, gamma is about 1968.

So, tau = t / gamma.

Wait, no. Wait, the proper time tau is the time in the spaceship's frame. So, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t * 0.000509.

But wait, t is about 163,000 years from Earth's perspective. So tau = 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.000509 is approximately 5.09e-4.

163,000 * 5.09e-4 = let's compute 163,000 * 5.09e-4.

163,000 * 5e-4 = 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163,000 * 0.000009 = 1.467.

So 81.5 + 1.467 ≈ 82.967 years.

So, tau is approximately 83 years.

Wait, but wait, I approximated gamma as 1968, and then tau = t / gamma.

Wait, no, t is in Earth's frame. So, tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ 82.967 years. So about 83 years.

But wait, that can't be right because the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. So 83 is not an option, but the closest is 81, which is option C. But wait, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, another approach: calculate the Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.99999987 c.

Compute v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974080809.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974080809 = 0.00000025919191.

sqrt(0.00000025919191) ≈ let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute 0.00000025919191.

That's 2.5919191e-7.

sqrt(2.5919191e-7) = sqrt(2.5919191) * 1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.5919191) is approximately 1.61, because 1.61^2=2.5921, which is very close to 2.5919191.

So sqrt ≈ 1.61.

1e-3.5 is 3.16227766e-4.

So 1.61 * 3.16227766e-4 ≈ 5.090e-4.

So gamma is 1 / (5.090e-4) ≈ 1964.29.

Wait, that's more precise. So gamma ≈ 1964.29.

So Earth time t = D / v.

D is 163,000 ly, v = 0.99999987 c.

t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987).

Earlier, I approximated 1/0.99999987 as 1.00000013, but let's be precise.

Actually, 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + x^3 + ... So for x=1.3e-7, approx 1.3e-7 is very small, so 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x + x². x² is negligible, so approx 1 + 1.3e-7.

So t ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7.

163,000 * 1.3e-7 = 163,000 * 1.3 * 1e-7 = (163,000 * 1.3) * 1e-7.

163,000 *1.3 = 211,900.

211,900 * 1e-7 = 0.02119.

So t ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.02119 years.

Now, the proper time tau = t / gamma.

t is 163,000.02119 years; gamma is approx 1964.29.

So tau ≈ 163,000.02119 / 1964.29 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division.

Approximately, 163,000 / 1964 ≈ let's see.

Well, 1964 * 83 = ?

1964 *80 = 157,120.

1964 *3=5,892.

So 157,120 +5,892=163,012.

So 1964 *83 = 163,012.

But our numerator is 163,000.02119, which is a bit less than 163,012.

So 163,000.02119 ≈ 83 *1964 - (163,012 -163,000.02119) = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 163,000 / 1964.29.

So 163,000 / 1964.29 = ?

Let me compute 1964.29 *83 = 1964 *83 + 0.29 *83.

1964 *83 = (2000-36)*83 = 2000*83=166,000, minus 36*83=2,988 → 166,000 -2,988 =163,012.

0.29 *83 = approx 24.07.

So total is 163,012 +24.07 =163,036.07.

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to find what 1964.29 multiplied by what gives me 163,000.

Wait, perhaps I can approach it as 163,000 = 1964.29 * x → x = 163000 / 1964.29 ≈ 83.0.

Wait, but wait 1964.29 *83 = 163,012 as before. So 163,012 is larger than 163,000 by about 12. So 83 would give 163,012, which is 12 more than 163,000.

So x is 83 - (12/1964.29) → 83 - approx 0.0061 → x≈82.9939.

So, 163,000 /1964.29 ≈82.994 years.

So tau ≈82.994 years, which is about 83 years.

But the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. So 83 is not an option, but option C is 81, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximations are leading me astray.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the distance from the LMC to Earth is more accurately about 160,000 light-years. Wait, I thought it was about 163,000, but perhaps 160,000 is a better approximation.

Wait, let me double-check: the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. So I think my initial assumption is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that the speed is so close to c that the time from the astronaut's perspective is D/(v gamma), where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, maybe another approach is to calculate the distance as being length-contracted from the astronaut's perspective. Because from their frame, the distance is shorter by a factor of gamma.

So, D' = D / gamma.

So D' = 163,000 ly / 1964.29 ≈ 163,000 / 1964.29 ≈ 83 light-years.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v.

v is 0.99999987 c.

So, D' =83 ly.

Time τ = D' / v = 83 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 83 / 0.99999987 years.

Which is approximately 83 * (1/0.99999987) ≈83 *1.00000013≈83.0001 years.

So again, about 83 years.

Hmm, but none of the options is 83. The closest is option C) 81 years.

So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in either the distance or the speed.

Wait, the speed is given as 0.99999987 c, which is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. So that's 99.999987% the speed of light.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Lorentz factor more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with a different approach, such as using the approximation for v very close to c.

Wait, when v is very close to c, gamma is approximately c/(c-v), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that gamma is approximately 1/(sqrt(2*(1-v/c))), but that's not correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the consideration of the average lifetime of the aliens being 150 solar years. Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So, from Earth's perspective, they are 150 years old, but from their perspective, they'd age less. Wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time. So if the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, their age would be 22 +83=105, which is less than 150, so they'd survive.

But the options are about the time taken, not the age. So the time is about 83 years, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the distance is 160,000 ly. Let me recalculate with D=160,000 ly.

t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 *1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.208 years.

gamma is 1964.29.

tau = t_earth / gamma = 160,000.208 /1964.29 ≈ approx 81.3 years.

Ah, that's closer to 81 years, which is option C.

So perhaps the distance is approximately 160,000 ly, leading to about 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is 170,000 ly. Let me try with D=170,000.

t_earth = 170,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 *1.00000013 ≈ 170,000.221 years.

tau = 170,000.221 / 1964.29 ≈ approx 86.5 years.

That's not matching any option.

Hmm, maybe the problem uses a different distance. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, let me compute gamma with more precision.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = (1 -1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.5919191e-7.

Now, gamma is 1/ sqrt(2.5919191e-7) ≈ 1/ (5.090e-4) ≈1964.29.

But perhaps with more precise calculation, gamma is 1964.29. So tau = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth is D/(v) = D/(0.99999987 c) = D/(0.99999987) * (1 ly) / (c) * years. Since D is in light-years, t_earth is D/(v) in years.

So, with D=163,000 ly, t_earth is 163000 /0.99999987 ≈163000.021 years.

Tau = 163000.021 / 1964.29 ≈83.0 years.

But the options don't have 83. The closest option is C)81.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that for v ≈ c, gamma ≈ D/(v * tau).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula again.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = (D' )/v, where D' is the contracted distance.

D' = D / gamma.

So, tau = (D / gamma) / v = D/(gamma * v).

But since v is approximately c, gamma*v ≈ gamma c.

So, tau = D/(gamma c).

But D is in light-years, so D/(c) is the time in years for light to travel that distance.

Wait, so D/(c) is the time in years. So, tau = (D / gamma) /v = (D/(gamma)) * (1/v) = D/(gamma * v). Since v≈c, this becomes D/(gamma *c) = (D/c) / gamma.

But D/c is the time for light to travel, which is the distance in light-years, so D/c is D ly / c = D years.

Wait, so tau = D/(gamma * c) = D/(gamma * c) = (D/c) / gamma → D is in light-years, so D/c is D years. So tau = D / gamma.

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier analysis showed that tau is t_earth / gamma.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the approximation that for v ≈ c, gamma ≈ D / (v * tau).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for time dilation directly.

But I think the proper way is to compute tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Which with t_earth = D /v, and D=163,000 ly.

So, tau= (163,000 / 0.99999987 ) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

Which is (163,000.021) * (0.000509) ≈ 82.97 years.

So about 83 years.

But since the options don't include 83, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 170,000 ly. Let me compute with D=170,000.

tau = (170,000 /0.99999987 ) * 0.000509 ≈ (170,000.221) * 0.000509 ≈ 170,000 *0.000509 ≈86.53 years.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 150,000 light-years.

tau = 150,000 *0.000509 ≈76.35 years. So about 76 years. Closest option is D)77.

But my initial assumption was D=163,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approximation.

Wait another thought: perhaps using the approximation that for v very close to c, gamma ≈ (c)/(c-v).

Wait, v =0.99999987 c → c-v=1.3e-7 c.

gamma ≈ c/(c-v) → 1/(1.3e-7) ≈7.69e6. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gives gamma as about 1964.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation that for v close to c, gamma ≈ 1/(sqrt(2*(1-v/c))).

Wait, let's compute 1-v/c = 1-0.99999987= 1.3e-7.

So sqrt(2*(1.3e-7)) = sqrt(2.6e-7)= approx 5.099e-4.

So gamma ≈1/5.099e-4 ≈1960.

Which is similar to the earlier value of gamma=1964.29.

So, with gamma=1960, and D=163,000 ly:

t_earth=163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000.021 years.

tau=163,000.021 /1960 ≈83.17 years.

So still around 83 years.

So the problem must have a different figure for the distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed as 0.999999c, which would change things.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.999999c, not 0.99999987c. Let's see.

If v=0.999999c, then v²/c² = (0.999999)^2 = 0.999998.

So 1 -v²/c² =2e-6.

sqrt(2e-6) = sqrt(2)*1e-3 ≈1.4142e-3.

So gamma=1/(1.4142e-3) ≈707.1.

So then for D=163,000 ly.

t_earth=163,000 /0.999999 ≈163,000 *1.000001 ≈163,000.163 years.

tau=163,000.163 /707.1 ≈230.5 years.

But that's way beyond the astronaut's lifetime of 150 years. So the astronaut would die before reaching Earth.

But the options don't have that with the given speed in the problem.

Wait, but the initial speed in the problem is 0.99999987c, so very close to c.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to be done with the approximation that when v is extremely close to c, gamma is approximately (1e8) or something, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the approximation that for v=0.99999987c, the time experienced is roughly D / (v * gamma), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the time as D/(v * gamma), where gamma is about 1964, so D=163,000 ly.

So D/(v gamma) = 163,000 / (0.99999987 *1964) ≈163,000/(1964) ≈83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the astronaut's experienced time is D/(v * gamma), but wait, D is in light-years, v is in terms of c (so in ly/year), so D/(v) is time in years, then multiplied by sqrt(1 -v²/c²), which is 1/gamma.

So tau = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * (1/gamma) ) = D/(v gamma).

Which is the same as D/(v gamma) = D/(gamma v).

But since v is close to c, gamma is about 1964, v is 0.99999987, so gamma v ≈1964 *0.99999987 ≈1964.

So, tau= D/(gamma) ≈163,000 /1964 ≈83 years.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)77, but perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is so close to c that the time is approx D/(c) * (1 - (v/c)).

Wait, because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) ≈ t_earth * (1 - v²/(2c²)).

Hmm, perhaps using the approximation sqrt(1-x) ≈1 -x/2 for small x.

So, sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ≈1 - (v²)/(2c²).

So, tau = t_earth * [1 - (v²)/(2c²) ].

t_earth = D/(v) = 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000 years (approx).

Wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so v²/c² is approximately 1, so 1 - (v²)/(2c²) = 1 - (0.99999987^2)/2.

Wait, 0.99999987^2≈0.99999974.

So 1 - 0.99999974/2 = 1 - 0.49999987 = 0.50000013.

So tau ≈163,000 * 0.50000013 ≈81,500 years. No, that's way off. That can't be right.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective.

The distance they travel (in their frame) is contracted by gamma. So the distance is D' = D / gamma.

So, D'=163,000 /1964≈83 ly.

Time taken is D' / v = 83 ly / 0.99999987c ≈83 /0.99999987 years ≈83.0000009 years.

So about 83 years. So the astronaut would experience 83 years.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is given as 170,000 ly.

Wait, no, the problem says the LMC, so I think the actual distance is about 163,000 ly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect some decimal places, leading to an approximate 81 years.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use a calculator, but since I'm doing it manually, let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the gamma factor is computed as 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)).

Compute 0.99999987 squared: let's compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - 0.99999974 =0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = approx 0.0005099.

So gamma is 1/0.0005099 ≈1960.

So tau= t_earth / gamma ≈ (163000 /0.99999987) /1960 ≈ 163000.021/1960≈83.08 years.

Hmm, about 83 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to approximate gamma as 1960, leading to 163000 /1960 ≈83.

But the options don't have 83, so perhaps the intended answer is D)77 years, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the exact speed.

The speed is 0.99999987 c. So, let me compute v²/c² more accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute it precisely.

0.99999987 *0.99999987:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2

=1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

=1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

=0.99999974 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - v²/c²= 1 -0.99999974 -1.69e-14= 0.00000026 -1.69e-14 ≈0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026)= approximately 0.0005099.

So gamma=1/0.0005099≈1960.

So, tau=163000 /1960 ≈83.08 years.

If the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula tau = (D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²)) / v.

Which is same as tau= D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) /v.

So, D=163,000 ly.

sqrt(1 -v²/c²)=0.0005099.

So tau= 163000 *0.0005099 /0.99999987.

Compute numerator: 163000 *0.0005099= 163000 *0.0005=81.5, 163000 *0.0000099=1.6177. Total=83.1177.

Divide by 0.99999987: 83.1177 /0.99999987≈83.1177 *1.00000013≈83.12 years.

Again, 83 years.

But the options don't have 83.

Wait, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B)72

C)81

D)77.

So why is the correct answer not among the options? Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use D=170,000 ly.

But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approach, such as relativistic velocity addition, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is intended to use the gamma factor as approximately 125, leading to tau=163000/125≈130 years, but that's not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the speed is 0.999c, which would give a different gamma.

If v=0.999c, gamma= 22.029.

Then, tau=163,000 /22.029≈7393 years. No, that's way longer than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.998c, gamma=14.86.

Tau=163,000/14.86≈11,000 years. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99c, gamma=7.089.

Tau=163,000/7.089≈23,000 years. Still no.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the time as D/(v) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

D=163,000 ly, v=0.99999987c.

t_earth=163000/0.99999987≈163,000 years.

tau=163000 * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) =163000 *0.0005099≈82.7 years.

So, about 83 years.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation that sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (c^2 -v^2)/(c^2), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the hyperbolic functions approach, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to approximate the time as D/(c) * (1 -v/c), but that seems incorrect.

Wait, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

Which is D/(v) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = D * sqrt( (1 -v²/c²)/v² ) = D * sqrt( (c² -v²)/v² c² ) = D * sqrt( (c²-v²) ) / (v c).

Hmm, perhaps I can compute that.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to note that for such a high speed, the time experienced is so small that the astronaut would die before reaching, but that's not the case here because 83 years is less than the average lifetime of 150 years.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So 83 years later, they would be 105, which is still less than 150. So they would survive.

But option A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. But according to calculation, they would live.

Thus, option A is incorrect.

The options B, C, D are 72,81,77 years.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate gamma with more precise figures.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let me compute it precisely.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

= (1 - 1.3e-7) * (1 -1.3e-7) = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

So 1 -2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 = 0.99999974 + ... So approximately 0.99999974.

Thus, 1 - v²/c²=0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026)= approx 5.099e-4 (as before).

Gamma=1/5.099e-4≈1960.

So tau=163000/(gamma * v/c).

Wait, no, wait: v is 0.99999987c, so v/c=0.99999987.

So tau= (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (163000 /0.99999987) * 5.099e-4.

Compute 163000 /0.99999987= 163000 *1.00000013=163000.2119.

Multiply by 5.099e-4: 163000.2119 *5.099e-4 ≈ let's compute.

163000 *5.099e-4=163000 *0.0005099= 163000 *0.0005=81.5, 163000 *0.0000099≈1.6177. So total ≈83.1177 years.

So, approximately 83.12 years.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. Let me think: perhaps it's 162,000 ly.

Tau=162000/(1960)≈82.6 years.

Still no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses D=160,000 ly.

Tau=160000/1960≈81.63 years.

That's close to 81, which is option C.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

Therefore, the correct answer is C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using relativistic time dilation and length contraction principles. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth is approximately \( D = 163,000 \) light-years. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, \( \tau \)) is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \)) due to relativistic effects.

### Key Equations:
1. **Time in Earth's frame**:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v}
   \]
2. **Proper time experienced by the astronaut**:  
   \[
   \tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
3. **Lorentz factor**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Thus, \( \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} \).

### Calculations:
1. **Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}}
   \]
   Approximating \( (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974 \), we find:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099} \approx 1960
   \]

2. **Time in Earth's frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \))**:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000.021 \, \text{years}
   \]

3. **Proper time (\( \tau \))**:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000.021}{1960} \approx 83.12 \, \text{years}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  The astronaut's average lifetime is 150 years, and the proper time for the journey is approximately 83 years. Since \( 83 < 150 \), the astronaut would survive the trip. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: \( 72 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is significantly lower than the calculated proper time of 83 years. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: \( 81 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is close to the calculated proper time of 83 years. Given potential approximations in the problem, this is the most reasonable choice.

- **Option D**: \( 77 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is also lower than the calculated proper time and less accurate than Option C. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The proper time for the astronaut's journey is approximately 83 years, but since this value is not among the options, the closest match is **Option C: 81 years**.
