Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved in orbital periods, but I'm not exactly sure how all the details fit together here.

So the problem states that there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe it's not super relevant for solving this problem. 

The given data points are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So, if I denote the equilibrium temperatures as T1, T2, T3, then T1/T2 ≈ 1.4 and T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. That means T1 is higher than T2, and T2 is higher than T3.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is T = [(L/(16πσ d²))^(1/4)], where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T ∝ (L)^(1/4) / d^(1/2). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), or d is proportional to 1/(T)^2.

Wait, no, let's think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = (L * (1 - a) / (16 * π * σ * d²))^(1/4). Here, a is the albedo. Oh, right, the problem says all planets have the same albedo, 0.3, so a is the same for all. So the ratio of temperatures only depends on the distance.

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (d2/(d1)) ), wait, wait, no. Let me get that right. Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). Because T1 = (1/sqrt(d1)) * const, T2 = (1/sqrt(d2)) * const. So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 is about 1.96 times d1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Hmm, but wait, that seems counterintuitive because higher temperature usually means closer orbit. Oh wait, no, since higher T would mean being closer, right? Because if a planet is closer to the star, it's hotter. So if T1 is higher than T2, Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Wait, but according to the ratio, T1 is 1.4 times T2. So if T1 > T2, then Planet1 is closer than Planet2. So the distance ratio d2/d1 is (T1/T2)^2. Since T1/T2 is 1.4, so d2 = d1 * (1.4)^2 = d1 * 1.96. So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between T2 and T3 is 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3. So T2 > T3, meaning Planet2 is closer than Planet3. So the distance ratio d3/d2 = (T2 / T3)^2. T2/T3 is 2.3, so d3 = d2 * (2.3)^2. (2.3 squared is 5.29). So d3 is 5.29 times d2.

Putting it all together, d3 is 5.29 * d2, and d2 is 1.96 * d1. So d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1. Let me calculate 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, but more accurately: 5.29 * 2 would be 10.58, but since it's 1.96 (which is 2 - 0.04), let's compute it.

5.29 * 1.96 = 5.29 * (2 - 0.04) = 10.58 - (5.29 * 0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So d3 is approximately 10.3684 times d1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. We need to find the factor by which the period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

I remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (d), assuming the mass of the star is much larger than the planet's. The formula is P² ∝ d³. Or more precisely, P² = (4π²/G M_star) * d³. But since all planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all, so the ratio of their periods can be found using only the distances.

So, P1² / P3² = (d1/d3)^3. Taking square roots, P1/P3 = (d1/d3)^(3/2). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right.

Kepler's third law: P² ∝ d³. So (P3/P1)² = (d3/d1)^3. So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

We have d3/d1 = ~10.3684. So (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5).

Let me compute that. First, the square root of 10.3684 is approximately 3.22 (since 3.22² is about 10.36). Then, 10.3684^(3/2) = (10.3684^1) * (10.3684^0.5) ) = 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ 33.38.

So P3 is approximately 33.38 times larger than P1. Let me check the options. Option D is ~33.4, which matches.

But wait, let me recheck my calculations. Also, what about the other part of the problem where the mass ratios are given? The problem mentions the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So mass of Planet1 = 1.15 * Planet2's mass, and Planet3 = 1.35 * Planet2's mass.

Wait, but does that affect the orbital period? I don't think so, because Kepler's third law in the context of planets orbiting the same star depends on the star's mass, not the planet's mass. Because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's. So the period depends only on the distance and the star's mass, which is fixed here. So the given mass ratios probably don't affect the calculation of the period ratio. So I can ignore them for this problem.

So the answer should be D) ~33.4.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( d \): 

\[
P^2 \propto d^3
\]

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( T \propto 1/\sqrt{d} \)). Given the temperature ratios:

- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

we can relate the distances as follows:

1. \( T_1 / T_2 = \sqrt{d_2 / d_1} \)  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   d_2 / d_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1 \).

2. \( T_2 / T_3 = \sqrt{d_3 / d_2} \)  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   d_3 / d_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2 \).

Combining these results,  
\[
d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2 = 5.29 \cdot (1.96 \cdot d_1) = 10.3684 \cdot d_1
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the period ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the ratio of orbital periods is related to the distances as:

\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 = 10.3684 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \). Then:  
\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.38
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

### Step 3: Considering the mass ratios
The problem provides the mass ratios between the planets (\( M_1 / M_2 = 1.15 \), \( M_2 / M_3 = 1.35 \)). However, Kepler's third law depends only on the distance from the star and the star's mass, not the planet's mass. Since all planets orbit the same star, the mass ratios do not affect the calculation of the period ratio.

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1.

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (d2/(d1)) ), wait, wait, no. Let me get that right. Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). Because T1 = (1/sqrt(d1)) * const, T2 = (1/sqrt(d2)) * const.

Because if a planet is closer to the star, it's hotter. So if T1 is higher than T2, Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Wait, but according to the ratio, T1 is 1.4 times T2. So if T1 > T2, then Planet1 is closer than Planet2. So the distance ratio d2/d1 is (T1/T2)^2. Since T1/T2 is 1.4, so d2 = d1 * (1.4)^2 = d1 * 1.96. So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between T2 and T3 is 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3. So T2 > T3, meaning Planet2 is closer than Planet3. So the distance ratio d3/d2 = (T2 / T3)^2. T2/T3 is 2.3, so d3 = d2 * (2.3)^2. (2.3 squared is 5.29). So d3 is 5.29 times d2.

Putting it all together, d3 is 5.29 * d2, and d2 is 1.96 * d1. So d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1. Let me calculate 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, but more accurately: 5.29 * 2 would be 10.58, but since it's 1.96 (which is 2 - 0.04), let's compute it.

5.29 * 1.96 = 5.29 * (2 - 0.04) = 10.58 - (5.29 * 0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So d3 is approximately 10.3684 times d1.

But since all planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all, so the ratio of their periods can be found using only the distances.

So, P1² / P3² = (d1/d3)^3. Taking square roots, P1/P3 = (d1/d3)^(3/2). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right.

Kepler's third law: P² ∝ d³. So (P3/P1)² = (d3/d1)^3. So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

We have d3/d1 = ~10.3684. So (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5).

Let me compute that. First, the square root of 10.3684 is approximately 3.22 (since 3.22² is about 10.36). Then, 10.3684^(3/2) = (10.3684^1) * (10.3684^0.5) ) = 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ 33.38.

So P3 is approximately 33.38 times larger than P1. Let me check the options. Option D is ~33.4, which matches.

\[
P^2 \propto d^3
\]

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( T \propto 1/\sqrt{d} \)). Given the temperature ratios:

- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

we can relate the distances as follows:

1. \( T_1 / T_2 = \sqrt{d_2 / d_1} \)  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   d_2 / d_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1 \).

2. \( T_2 / T_3 = \sqrt{d_3 / d_2} \)  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   d_3 / d_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]  
   Thus, \( d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2 \).

Combining these results,  
\[
d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2 = 5.29 \cdot (1.96 \cdot d_1) = 10.3684 \cdot d_1
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the period ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the ratio of orbital periods is related to the distances as:

\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 = 10.3684 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \). Then:  
\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.38
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

### Step 3: Considering the mass ratios
The problem provides the mass ratios between the planets (\( M_1 / M_2 = 1.15 \), \( M_2 / M_3 = 1.35 \)). However, Kepler's third law depends only on the distance from the star and the star's mass, not the planet's mass. Since all planets orbit the same star, the mass ratios do not affect the calculation of the period ratio.
