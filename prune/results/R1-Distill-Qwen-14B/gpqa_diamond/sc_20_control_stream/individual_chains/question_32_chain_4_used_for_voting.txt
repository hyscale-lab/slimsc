Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the relativistic formulas perfectly, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. 

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So, Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass I'll need is for a Li-6 nucleus.

The speed is given as 0.96c. The goal is to find the total energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy (E) of a moving object is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m c². 

But wait, what's gamma? Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to calculate gamma first.

Let me write down the formula for gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))

Given v = 0.96c, let's calculate that. So v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is similar, around 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass should be 6 nucleons each around 938.5 MeV. 

Wait, but wait. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for a nucleus like Li-6, we can't just add the individual masses because of binding energy. But wait, wait, in this problem, since we're dealing with the rest mass of the nucleus, should I use the sum of the individual nucleon masses minus the binding energy? Or is there an approximate mass given?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be determined using the mass number and the binding energy, but maybe for this problem, they just want me to consider the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleon masses. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass in MeV/c². Let's see, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.94094 u (atomic mass units). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.94094 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 6.94094 * 931.5. Let's see:

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.94094 * 931.5. Let's compute 0.9 *931.5 = 838.35, 0.04 *931.5=37.26, 0.00094 *931.5≈0.876. So total is 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.876≈876.49. So 6.94094 *931.5 is about 5589 + 876.49 = 6465.49 MeV, which is around 6.465 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, if I can't find that, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton (or neutron), but that's a rough approximation.

Wait, but let's think again. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.94094 atomic mass units. So converting that to MeV, that's 6.94094 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that accurately.

6.94094 * 931.5:

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.94094 * 931.5. Let's compute 0.9 *931.5= 838.35. 

0.04*931.5=37.26.

Now, 0.00094 *931.5≈0.876.

So adding 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.876=876.486.

So total is 5589 + 876.486 = 6465.486 MeV, which is 6.465486 GeV. Let's note that as approximately 6.465 GeV.

Wait, but the options are in the 18-23 GeV range. So that's the rest mass energy. The total energy would be gamma times that. Gamma was approximately 3.5714.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 6.465 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3 *6.465 is 19.395.

0.5714 *6.465 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *6.465=3.2325, 0.0714 *6.465≈0.462. So total is approximately 3.2325 +0.462=3.6945.

So 3.5714 *6.465 ≈19.395 +3.6945=23.0895 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me do a more precise calculation:

6.465 GeV multiplied by 3.57142857.

So 6.465 *3 =19.395.

6.465 *0.5 =3.2325.

6.465 *0.07142857 ≈ let's compute 6.465 *0.07=0.45255, and 6.465 *0.00142857≈0.00923. So total ≈0.45255 +0.00923=0.46178.

Adding all together: 19.395 +3.2325=22.6275 +0.46178≈23.089 GeV.

So about 23.09 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close. Option D is 21.419, which is a bit lower.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value. 

Wait, another approach. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.94094 u. Let me compute 6.94094 *931.5:

6.94094 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

First, 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.94094 *931.5:

Compute 0.9 *931.5 = 838.35.

0.04 *931.5 =37.26.

0.00094 *931.5≈0.876.

So 838.35 +37.26 =875.61 +0.876=876.486.

So total is 5589 +876.486=6465.486 MeV, which is 6.465486 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *6.465486 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465486.

Let me do 3 *6.465486 =19.396458.

0.57142857 *6.465486.

Well, 0.5 *6.465486=3.232743.

0.07142857 *6.465486 ≈ 0.07142857 *6 ≈0.428571, and 0.07142857 *0.465486≈0.03323.

So 0.428571 +0.03323≈0.4618.

So 3.232743 +0.4618 ≈3.694543.

Adding to 19.396458, total is 19.396458 +3.694543=23.090999 GeV.

So approximately 23.091 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. That's close, but not exactly matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculation. v is 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Let me think: 0.28 *0.28=0.0784, so yes, exact. So no error there.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.96 squared accurately. 0.96 *0.96 = (1 - 0.04)^2 =1 - 0.08 +0.0016=0.9216. Yes, correct.

So gamma is correct.

Another possibility is that perhaps the mass used is more precise. Let me think: when you have a nucleus, the actual rest mass is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. So I used the exact atomic mass, which already includes that. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass using a more precise value. Let me check if the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.94094 u. Let me confirm that. Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.94094 u. Yes, that's correct.

So, then, the computed energy is approximately 23.09 GeV. So why is the option B 23.069 GeV? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the product gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465486 GeV.

Let me write down the numbers:

3.57142857 *6.465486.

Let me compute 3 *6.465486 =19.396458.

0.57142857 *6.465486.

Compute 0.5 *6.465486 =3.232743.

0.07142857 *6.465486 = let's compute exactly:

6.465486 *0.07 =0.45258402.

6.465486 *0.00142857 ≈ Let's compute 6.465486 * (1/700) since 0.00142857 ≈1/700.

1/700 is approximately 0.00142857. So 6.465486/700 = approx 0.0092364.

So 0.45258402 +0.0092364 =0.46182042.

So 0.57142857 *6.465486 =3.232743 +0.46182042 =3.6945634.

Adding to 19.396458: 19.396458 +3.6945634=23.0910214 GeV.

So approximately 23.091 GeV.

But option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me see, perhaps the mass is not 6.465 GeV but a little less, which would bring the total energy down.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.94094268 u. Let me compute that:

6.94094268 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ ?

Wait, 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.94094268 * 931.494 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.94094268 *931.494 = let's compute this.

Let me break it down:

0.9 *931.494 = 838.3446.

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.00094268 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.0009 *931.494=0.8383446, and 0.00004268 *931.494≈0.03984. So total ≈0.8383446 +0.03984=0.8781846.

Adding the three parts: 838.3446 +37.25976 =875.60436 +0.8781846≈876.48254.

So total is 5588.964 +876.48254 = 6465.44654 MeV, which is 6.46544654 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *6.46544654 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.46544654.

Hmm. Let's compute 3 *6.46544654=19.3963396.

0.57142857 *6.46544654.

0.5 *6.46544654=3.23272327.

0.07142857 *6.46544654= let's compute that.

0.07 *6.46544654=0.452581258.

0.00142857 *6.46544654≈0.0092364.

So 0.452581258 +0.0092364≈0.461817658.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544654=3.23272327 +0.461817658=3.69454093.

Adding to 19.3963396: 19.3963396 +3.69454093=23.0908805 GeV.

So approximately 23.0909 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is B) 23.069 GeV, and another is D) 21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the mass of a single nucleon, like a proton or neutron, which would be about 0.938 GeV each. But the nucleus is Li-6, which has 6 nucleons. So the rest mass would be 6 * 0.938 GeV =5.628 GeV. But that's a rough approximation and doesn't account for binding energy, so the actual mass would be slightly less than 6 *0.938 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about that. The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy that holds the nucleons together. The mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons minus the binding energy (divided by c², but when calculating the rest mass, we use E=mc², so perhaps the binding energy is subtracted as a mass deficit).

But for this problem, I think the correct way is to use the precise atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.94094 u, as I did earlier. So why is the calculated energy not matching any of the options except B, which is 23.069 GeV, which is about 23.07 GeV, but our calculation is 23.09 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute gamma with more precise numbers.

v is 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c^2.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct.

Maybe I should compute the product with more precision.

6.46544654 GeV *3.57142857.

Let me compute 6.46544654 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

3 *6.46544654 =19.3963396.

0.57142857 *6.46544654.

Compute 0.5 *6.46544654 =3.23272327.

0.07142857 *6.46544654.

Let me compute 6.46544654 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is approximately 5/70 = 1/14.

Wait, 1/14 is approximately 0.07142857.

So 6.46544654 * (1/14) =6.46544654 /14 ≈0.46181761.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544654 =3.23272327 +0.46181761=3.69454088.

Total E =19.3963396 +3.69454088=23.09088048 GeV.

Hmm, so around 23.0909 GeV. But option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV less.

Wait, perhaps the energy is expressed with more precise numbers. Let me think. Maybe the mass of Li-6 is slightly different?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy as 6 * the mass of a proton. Let's try that.

Mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², so 6 protons would be 5629.632 MeV, which is 5.629632 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 *5.629632 GeV.

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.5714 *5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.0714 *5.629632≈0.4037.

So 2.814816+0.4037≈3.2185.

So E≈16.888896 +3.2185≈20.1074 GeV.

But that's not matching any options either. The options don't have a 20 GeV option, except option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's way lower than the earlier calculation.

Wait, but this approach is incorrect because the mass of the nucleus is not simply six times the mass of a proton due to binding energy. So the correct approach is to use the precise atomic mass, which leads to around 23.09 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) as 938 MeV, and the nucleus has 6 nucleons, so 6 *938 MeV. But that's 5.628 GeV, and with gamma 3.5714, E=5.628 *3.5714≈20.14 GeV, which is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the precise calculation using the actual mass of Li-6, which is 6.94094 u.

This is confusing. But perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. So if I proceed that way, let's compute.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Mass of each proton is 938.272 MeV, neutron is about 939.565 MeV.

So total mass would be (3 *938.272) + (3 *939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, so E=5.6335 *3.5714 ≈ let's compute.

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.6335 *3.5714≈2.260.

Total ≈17.857 +2.260=20.117 GeV.

Hmm, that's close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But again, this approach doesn't account for the binding energy, so it's an approximation.

But the precise calculation using the actual mass of Li-6 gives around 23.09 GeV, which isn't an option. The closest option is B) 23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

But perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

0.0784 is 784 *1e-4. sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different calculation method, like non-relativistic, but that's unlikely since v is 0.96c, so relativistic effects are significant.

Wait, another thought. The question is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions. The energy per nucleus is usually given in terms of the total kinetic energy, or the total energy (which includes rest mass). Wait, but the options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So the total energy would be gamma * m c².

But perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy instead. Wait, no, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think it refers to the total energy, not just kinetic.

Wait, but to clarify, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So if I compute that, what do I get?

Kinetic energy = (3.5714 -1) *6.46544654 GeV =2.5714 *6.46544654 ≈16.59 GeV.

But the options don't have that either.

Hmm, this is perplexing. I think I must have made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.94094 u. Let me compute 6.94094 * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.94094 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.94094 *931.5 = 876.486 as before.

So total 6465.486 MeV =6.465486 GeV.

That's correct.

So back to the main calculation. So E=3.57142857 *6.465486 =23.09088 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Wait, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV less than our calculated 23.09 GeV.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute with more precise gamma and mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Let me recompute gamma using more precise calculation.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

So that's precise.

Mass: 6.94094 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6.94094 *931.494.

I'll compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.94094 *931.494.

Compute 0.9 *931.494=838.3446.

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.00094 *931.494≈0.876.

So total 838.3446 +37.25976=875.60436 +0.876=876.48036.

Total mass=5588.964 +876.48036=6465.44436 MeV=6.46544436 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.46544436.

Let me compute 3 *6.46544436=19.39633308.

0.57142857 *6.46544436.

0.5 *6.46544436=3.23272218.

0.07142857 *6.46544436.

Compute 6.46544436 *0.07=0.452581105.

6.46544436 *0.00142857≈0.0092363.

So total 0.452581105 +0.0092363≈0.461817405.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544436=3.23272218 +0.461817405=3.694539585.

Adding to 19.39633308: 19.39633308 +3.694539585=23.090872665 GeV.

So approximately 23.09087 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 23.07 GeV. So there's a discrepancy of about 0.02 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed, including more decimal places. Let me think: 0.96c is exact, so perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c^2.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

But perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Let me compute it numerically.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784, so it's exact. So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6.94094 u. Let me check. According to precise sources, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.94094268 u. So that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem expects me to round to four decimal places. So 23.09087 GeV would be 23.0909 GeV. But option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the mass of Li-6. Let me compute 6.94094268 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute 6.94094268 *931.494.

Breaking it down:

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.94094268 *931.494.

Compute 0.9 *931.494=838.3446.

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.00094268 *931.494.

Let me compute 931.494 *0.00094268.

Compute 931.494 *0.0009=0.8383446.

931.494 *0.00004268≈ approx 931.494 *0.00004=0.0372598, 931.494 *0.00000268≈0.002506.

So 0.0372598 +0.002506≈0.0397658.

So total 0.8383446 +0.0397658≈0.8781104.

So adding up: 838.3446 +37.25976=875.60436 +0.8781104=876.48247.

So total mass=5588.964 +876.48247=6465.44647 MeV=6.46544647 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.46544647.

Compute 3 *6.46544647=19.3963394.

0.57142857 *6.46544647.

0.5 *6.46544647=3.23272324.

0.07142857 *6.46544647.

Compute 6.46544647 *0.07=0.45258125.

6.46544647 *0.00142857≈0.0092364.

So 0.45258125 +0.0092364≈0.46181765.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544647=3.23272324 +0.46181765=3.69454089.

Adding to 19.3963394: 19.3963394 +3.69454089=23.0908803 GeV.

Hmm, about 23.09088 GeV. Still not matching option B.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. The question asks for the energy such that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps the kinetic energy is what's being referred to, but that would change the calculation.

Let me calculate the kinetic energy: (gamma -1)*m c².

So gamma is 3.5714, so gamma-1=2.5714.

2.5714 *6.46544647 GeV = ?

2*6.46544647=12.93089294.

0.5714 *6.46544647 ≈3.694.

So total≈12.93089294+3.694=16.62489 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me think. Another way: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.94094 u. But the actual rest mass energy is (6.94094 u) * (931.5 MeV/u) =6.94094 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.94094 *931.5=876.482 MeV.

So total=5589 +876.482=6465.482 MeV=6.465482 GeV.

So E=3.57142857*6.465482.

3.57142857 *6 =21.4285714.

3.57142857 *0.465482=?

Compute 3 *0.465482=1.396446.

0.57142857 *0.465482=0.265.

So approximately 1.396446 +0.265=1.661446.

So total E=21.4285714 +1.661446≈23.090 GeV.

Hmm, again, same result.

So perhaps the answer should be 23.09 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact product gamma * m c² with precise numbers.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465482 GeV.

3.57142857 *6 =21.42857142.

3.57142857 *0.465482.

Calculate 3 *0.465482=1.396446.

0.57142857 *0.465482.

Compute 0.5 *0.465482=0.232741.

0.07142857 *0.465482≈0.033234.

So 0.232741 +0.033234=0.265975.

So 3.57142857 *0.465482=1.396446 +0.265975=1.662421.

So total E=21.42857142 +1.662421≈23.090992 GeV.

So 23.091 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is Li-7? No, the question says 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the nuclear mass in terms of the number of nucleons and the mass of a nucleon, but without considering the binding energy. So for Li-6, 6 nucleons each with 938 MeV, so 6*938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.628 GeV=3.5714 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628≈3.216.

So total E≈16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is near option C: 20.132 GeV.

But that approach doesn't account for the binding energy, so it's less accurate.

Hmm. But given the options, perhaps the intended approach was to use the sum of the individual masses, leading to option C. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, but the calculations don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there's a miscalculation in the gamma value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise numbers.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the total energy in terms of the kinetic energy. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy.

I think the correct answer should be approximately 23.09 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B) 23.069 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the energy of the RHIC such that the speed is 0.96c. So it's the total energy, including the rest mass.

So, perhaps the intended answer is B)23.069 GeV, which is very close to our calculation of 23.09 GeV. But why the discrepancy? Maybe the problem uses a slightly different value for the mass or the speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Maybe the mass of Li-6 is 6.94094 u, but perhaps the precise value when multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives a slightly different result.

Wait, let me compute 6.94094 *931.5 exactly.

6.94094 *931.5:

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.94094 *931.5:

Compute 0.9 *931.5=838.35.

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.00094 *931.5=0.876.

So total 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.876=876.486.

So 5589 +876.486=6465.486 MeV=6.465486 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.465486.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.465486.

I think I'll have to accept that this gives approximately 23.09 GeV, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because RHIC accelerates entire nuclei.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy in a different way.

Wait, another way to compute gamma is using the formula:

gamma = (1 - (v²/c²))^(-1/2).

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the closest option is B)23.069 GeV, but my calculation gives about 23.09 GeV. Perhaps the intended answer is B, given the options.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistically moving object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.94094 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.94094 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 6465.486 \, \text{MeV} = 6.465486 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 6.465486 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3 \times 6.465486 = 19.396458 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 6.465486 \approx 3.694541 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E \approx 19.396458 + 3.694541 = 23.090999 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 23.09 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the provided options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Too low.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too low.

The closest match is **B) 23.069 GeV**, which is within a small margin of error from the calculated value.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC is approximately **23.069 GeV**.  
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the relativistic formulas perfectly, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. 

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So, Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass I'll need is for a Li-6 nucleus.

The speed is given as 0.96c. The goal is to find the total energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy (E) of a moving object is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m c². 

But wait, what's gamma? Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to calculate gamma first.

Let me write down the formula for gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))

Given v = 0.96c, let's calculate that. So v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is similar, around 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass should be 6 nucleons each around 938.5 MeV. 

Wait, but wait. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for a nucleus like Li-6, we can't just add the individual masses because of binding energy. But wait, wait, in this problem, since we're dealing with the rest mass of the nucleus, should I use the sum of the individual nucleon masses minus the binding energy? Or is there an approximate mass given?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be determined using the mass number and the binding energy, but maybe for this problem, they just want me to consider the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleon masses. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass in MeV/c². Let's see, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.94094 u (atomic mass units). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.94094 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 6.94094 * 931.5. Let's see:

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.94094 * 931.5. Let's compute 0.9 *931.5 = 838.35, 0.04 *931.5=37.26, 0.00094 *931.5≈0.876. So total is 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.876≈876.49. So 6.94094 *931.5 is about 5589 + 876.49 = 6465.49 MeV, which is around 6.465 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, if I can't find that, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton (or neutron), but that's a rough approximation.

Wait, but let's think again. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.94094 atomic mass units. So converting that to MeV, that's 6.94094 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that accurately.

6.94094 * 931.5:

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.94094 * 931.5. Let's compute 0.9 *931.5= 838.35. 

0.04*931.5=37.26.

Now, 0.00094 *931.5≈0.876.

So adding 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.876=876.486.

So total is 5589 + 876.486 = 6465.486 MeV, which is 6.465486 GeV. Let's note that as approximately 6.465 GeV.

Wait, but the options are in the 18-23 GeV range. So that's the rest mass energy. The total energy would be gamma times that. Gamma was approximately 3.5714.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 6.465 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3 *6.465 is 19.395.

0.5714 *6.465 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *6.465=3.2325, 0.0714 *6.465≈0.462. So total is approximately 3.2325 +0.462=3.6945.

So 3.5714 *6.465 ≈19.395 +3.6945=23.0895 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me do a more precise calculation:

6.465 GeV multiplied by 3.57142857.

So 6.465 *3 =19.395.

6.465 *0.5 =3.2325.

6.465 *0.07142857 ≈ let's compute 6.465 *0.07=0.45255, and 6.465 *0.00142857≈0.00923. So total ≈0.45255 +0.00923=0.46178.

Adding all together: 19.395 +3.2325=22.6275 +0.46178≈23.089 GeV.

So about 23.09 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close. Option D is 21.419, which is a bit lower.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value. 

Wait, another approach. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.94094 u. Let me compute 6.94094 *931.5:

6.94094 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

First, 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.94094 *931.5:

Compute 0.9 *931.5 = 838.35.

0.04 *931.5 =37.26.

0.00094 *931.5≈0.876.

So 838.35 +37.26 =875.61 +0.876=876.486.

So total is 5589 +876.486=6465.486 MeV, which is 6.465486 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *6.465486 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465486.

Let me do 3 *6.465486 =19.396458.

0.57142857 *6.465486.

Well, 0.5 *6.465486=3.232743.

0.07142857 *6.465486 ≈ 0.07142857 *6 ≈0.428571, and 0.07142857 *0.465486≈0.03323.

So 0.428571 +0.03323≈0.4618.

So 3.232743 +0.4618 ≈3.694543.

Adding to 19.396458, total is 19.396458 +3.694543=23.090999 GeV.

So approximately 23.091 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. That's close, but not exactly matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculation. v is 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Let me think: 0.28 *0.28=0.0784, so yes, exact. So no error there.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.96 squared accurately. 0.96 *0.96 = (1 - 0.04)^2 =1 - 0.08 +0.0016=0.9216. Yes, correct.

So gamma is correct.

Another possibility is that perhaps the mass used is more precise. Let me think: when you have a nucleus, the actual rest mass is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. So I used the exact atomic mass, which already includes that. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass using a more precise value. Let me check if the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.94094 u. Let me confirm that. Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.94094 u. Yes, that's correct.

So, then, the computed energy is approximately 23.09 GeV. So why is the option B 23.069 GeV? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the product gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465486 GeV.

Let me write down the numbers:

3.57142857 *6.465486.

Let me compute 3 *6.465486 =19.396458.

0.57142857 *6.465486.

Compute 0.5 *6.465486 =3.232743.

0.07142857 *6.465486 = let's compute exactly:

6.465486 *0.07 =0.45258402.

6.465486 *0.00142857 ≈ Let's compute 6.465486 * (1/700) since 0.00142857 ≈1/700.

1/700 is approximately 0.00142857. So 6.465486/700 = approx 0.0092364.

So 0.45258402 +0.0092364 =0.46182042.

So 0.57142857 *6.465486 =3.232743 +0.46182042 =3.6945634.

Adding to 19.396458: 19.396458 +3.6945634=23.0910214 GeV.

So approximately 23.091 GeV.

But option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me see, perhaps the mass is not 6.465 GeV but a little less, which would bring the total energy down.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.94094268 u. Let me compute that:

6.94094268 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ ?

Wait, 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.94094268 * 931.494 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.94094268 *931.494 = let's compute this.

Let me break it down:

0.9 *931.494 = 838.3446.

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.00094268 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.0009 *931.494=0.8383446, and 0.00004268 *931.494≈0.03984. So total ≈0.8383446 +0.03984=0.8781846.

Adding the three parts: 838.3446 +37.25976 =875.60436 +0.8781846≈876.48254.

So total is 5588.964 +876.48254 = 6465.44654 MeV, which is 6.46544654 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *6.46544654 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.46544654.

Hmm. Let's compute 3 *6.46544654=19.3963396.

0.57142857 *6.46544654.

0.5 *6.46544654=3.23272327.

0.07142857 *6.46544654= let's compute that.

0.07 *6.46544654=0.452581258.

0.00142857 *6.46544654≈0.0092364.

So 0.452581258 +0.0092364≈0.461817658.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544654=3.23272327 +0.461817658=3.69454093.

Adding to 19.3963396: 19.3963396 +3.69454093=23.0908805 GeV.

So approximately 23.0909 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is B) 23.069 GeV, and another is D) 21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the mass of a single nucleon, like a proton or neutron, which would be about 0.938 GeV each. But the nucleus is Li-6, which has 6 nucleons. So the rest mass would be 6 * 0.938 GeV =5.628 GeV. But that's a rough approximation and doesn't account for binding energy, so the actual mass would be slightly less than 6 *0.938 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about that. The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy that holds the nucleons together. The mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons minus the binding energy (divided by c², but when calculating the rest mass, we use E=mc², so perhaps the binding energy is subtracted as a mass deficit).

But for this problem, I think the correct way is to use the precise atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.94094 u, as I did earlier. So why is the calculated energy not matching any of the options except B, which is 23.069 GeV, which is about 23.07 GeV, but our calculation is 23.09 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute gamma with more precise numbers.

v is 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c^2.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct.

Maybe I should compute the product with more precision.

6.46544654 GeV *3.57142857.

Let me compute 6.46544654 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

3 *6.46544654 =19.3963396.

0.57142857 *6.46544654.

Compute 0.5 *6.46544654 =3.23272327.

0.07142857 *6.46544654.

Let me compute 6.46544654 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is approximately 5/70 = 1/14.

Wait, 1/14 is approximately 0.07142857.

So 6.46544654 * (1/14) =6.46544654 /14 ≈0.46181761.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544654 =3.23272327 +0.46181761=3.69454088.

Total E =19.3963396 +3.69454088=23.09088048 GeV.

Hmm, so around 23.0909 GeV. But option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV less.

Wait, perhaps the energy is expressed with more precise numbers. Let me think. Maybe the mass of Li-6 is slightly different?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy as 6 * the mass of a proton. Let's try that.

Mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², so 6 protons would be 5629.632 MeV, which is 5.629632 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 *5.629632 GeV.

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.5714 *5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.0714 *5.629632≈0.4037.

So 2.814816+0.4037≈3.2185.

So E≈16.888896 +3.2185≈20.1074 GeV.

But that's not matching any options either. The options don't have a 20 GeV option, except option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's way lower than the earlier calculation.

Wait, but this approach is incorrect because the mass of the nucleus is not simply six times the mass of a proton due to binding energy. So the correct approach is to use the precise atomic mass, which leads to around 23.09 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) as 938 MeV, and the nucleus has 6 nucleons, so 6 *938 MeV. But that's 5.628 GeV, and with gamma 3.5714, E=5.628 *3.5714≈20.14 GeV, which is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the precise calculation using the actual mass of Li-6, which is 6.94094 u.

This is confusing. But perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. So if I proceed that way, let's compute.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Mass of each proton is 938.272 MeV, neutron is about 939.565 MeV.

So total mass would be (3 *938.272) + (3 *939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, so E=5.6335 *3.5714 ≈ let's compute.

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.6335 *3.5714≈2.260.

Total ≈17.857 +2.260=20.117 GeV.

Hmm, that's close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But again, this approach doesn't account for the binding energy, so it's an approximation.

But the precise calculation using the actual mass of Li-6 gives around 23.09 GeV, which isn't an option. The closest option is B) 23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

But perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

0.0784 is 784 *1e-4. sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different calculation method, like non-relativistic, but that's unlikely since v is 0.96c, so relativistic effects are significant.

Wait, another thought. The question is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions. The energy per nucleus is usually given in terms of the total kinetic energy, or the total energy (which includes rest mass). Wait, but the options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So the total energy would be gamma * m c².

But perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy instead. Wait, no, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think it refers to the total energy, not just kinetic.

Wait, but to clarify, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So if I compute that, what do I get?

Kinetic energy = (3.5714 -1) *6.46544654 GeV =2.5714 *6.46544654 ≈16.59 GeV.

But the options don't have that either.

Hmm, this is perplexing. I think I must have made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.94094 u. Let me compute 6.94094 * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.94094 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.94094 *931.5 = 876.486 as before.

So total 6465.486 MeV =6.465486 GeV.

That's correct.

So back to the main calculation. So E=3.57142857 *6.465486 =23.09088 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Wait, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV less than our calculated 23.09 GeV.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute with more precise gamma and mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Let me recompute gamma using more precise calculation.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

So that's precise.

Mass: 6.94094 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6.94094 *931.494.

I'll compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.94094 *931.494.

Compute 0.9 *931.494=838.3446.

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.00094 *931.494≈0.876.

So total 838.3446 +37.25976=875.60436 +0.876=876.48036.

Total mass=5588.964 +876.48036=6465.44436 MeV=6.46544436 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.46544436.

Let me compute 3 *6.46544436=19.39633308.

0.57142857 *6.46544436.

0.5 *6.46544436=3.23272218.

0.07142857 *6.46544436.

Compute 6.46544436 *0.07=0.452581105.

6.46544436 *0.00142857≈0.0092363.

So total 0.452581105 +0.0092363≈0.461817405.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544436=3.23272218 +0.461817405=3.694539585.

Adding to 19.39633308: 19.39633308 +3.694539585=23.090872665 GeV.

So approximately 23.09087 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 23.07 GeV. So there's a discrepancy of about 0.02 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed, including more decimal places. Let me think: 0.96c is exact, so perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c^2.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

But perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Let me compute it numerically.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784, so it's exact. So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6.94094 u. Let me check. According to precise sources, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.94094268 u. So that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem expects me to round to four decimal places. So 23.09087 GeV would be 23.0909 GeV. But option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the mass of Li-6. Let me compute 6.94094268 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute 6.94094268 *931.494.

Breaking it down:

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.94094268 *931.494.

Compute 0.9 *931.494=838.3446.

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.00094268 *931.494.

Let me compute 931.494 *0.00094268.

Compute 931.494 *0.0009=0.8383446.

931.494 *0.00004268≈ approx 931.494 *0.00004=0.0372598, 931.494 *0.00000268≈0.002506.

So 0.0372598 +0.002506≈0.0397658.

So total 0.8383446 +0.0397658≈0.8781104.

So adding up: 838.3446 +37.25976=875.60436 +0.8781104=876.48247.

So total mass=5588.964 +876.48247=6465.44647 MeV=6.46544647 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.46544647.

Compute 3 *6.46544647=19.3963394.

0.57142857 *6.46544647.

0.5 *6.46544647=3.23272324.

0.07142857 *6.46544647.

Compute 6.46544647 *0.07=0.45258125.

6.46544647 *0.00142857≈0.0092364.

So 0.45258125 +0.0092364≈0.46181765.

So 0.57142857 *6.46544647=3.23272324 +0.46181765=3.69454089.

Adding to 19.3963394: 19.3963394 +3.69454089=23.0908803 GeV.

Hmm, about 23.09088 GeV. Still not matching option B.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. The question asks for the energy such that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps the kinetic energy is what's being referred to, but that would change the calculation.

Let me calculate the kinetic energy: (gamma -1)*m c².

So gamma is 3.5714, so gamma-1=2.5714.

2.5714 *6.46544647 GeV = ?

2*6.46544647=12.93089294.

0.5714 *6.46544647 ≈3.694.

So total≈12.93089294+3.694=16.62489 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me think. Another way: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.94094 u. But the actual rest mass energy is (6.94094 u) * (931.5 MeV/u) =6.94094 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.94094 *931.5=876.482 MeV.

So total=5589 +876.482=6465.482 MeV=6.465482 GeV.

So E=3.57142857*6.465482.

3.57142857 *6 =21.4285714.

3.57142857 *0.465482=?

Compute 3 *0.465482=1.396446.

0.57142857 *0.465482=0.265.

So approximately 1.396446 +0.265=1.661446.

So total E=21.4285714 +1.661446≈23.090 GeV.

Hmm, again, same result.

So perhaps the answer should be 23.09 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact product gamma * m c² with precise numbers.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465482 GeV.

3.57142857 *6 =21.42857142.

3.57142857 *0.465482.

Calculate 3 *0.465482=1.396446.

0.57142857 *0.465482.

Compute 0.5 *0.465482=0.232741.

0.07142857 *0.465482≈0.033234.

So 0.232741 +0.033234=0.265975.

So 3.57142857 *0.465482=1.396446 +0.265975=1.662421.

So total E=21.42857142 +1.662421≈23.090992 GeV.

So 23.091 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is Li-7? No, the question says 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the nuclear mass in terms of the number of nucleons and the mass of a nucleon, but without considering the binding energy. So for Li-6, 6 nucleons each with 938 MeV, so 6*938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.628 GeV=3.5714 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628≈3.216.

So total E≈16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is near option C: 20.132 GeV.

But that approach doesn't account for the binding energy, so it's less accurate.

Hmm. But given the options, perhaps the intended approach was to use the sum of the individual masses, leading to option C. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, but the calculations don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there's a miscalculation in the gamma value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise numbers.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the total energy in terms of the kinetic energy. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy.

I think the correct answer should be approximately 23.09 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B) 23.069 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the energy of the RHIC such that the speed is 0.96c. So it's the total energy, including the rest mass.

So, perhaps the intended answer is B)23.069 GeV, which is very close to our calculation of 23.09 GeV. But why the discrepancy? Maybe the problem uses a slightly different value for the mass or the speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Maybe the mass of Li-6 is 6.94094 u, but perhaps the precise value when multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives a slightly different result.

Wait, let me compute 6.94094 *931.5 exactly.

6.94094 *931.5:

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.94094 *931.5:

Compute 0.9 *931.5=838.35.

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.00094 *931.5=0.876.

So total 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.876=876.486.

So 5589 +876.486=6465.486 MeV=6.465486 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.465486.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.465486.

I think I'll have to accept that this gives approximately 23.09 GeV, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because RHIC accelerates entire nuclei.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy in a different way.

Wait, another way to compute gamma is using the formula:

gamma = (1 - (v²/c²))^(-1/2).

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the closest option is B)23.069 GeV, but my calculation gives about 23.09 GeV. Perhaps the intended answer is B, given the options.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistically moving object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.94094 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.94094 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 6465.486 \, \text{MeV} = 6.465486 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 6.465486 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3 \times 6.465486 = 19.396458 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 6.465486 \approx 3.694541 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E \approx 19.396458 + 3.694541 = 23.090999 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 23.09 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the provided options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Too low.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too low.

The closest match is **B) 23.069 GeV**, which is within a small margin of error from the calculated value.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC is approximately **23.069 GeV**.  
**Answer: B**
