Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's go through it step by step.

The question says that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half the integral. Hmm. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh right, if it were coupling, you'd see splitting into multiple peaks, but here it's two separate peaks. So, maybe something else is causing this.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So, the molecular weight is the same, but there are two peaks. What could that mean? Well, if it's the same mass, they might be isomers or something else but with same molecular weight.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the NMR would probably show different signals, and the LC-MS would have a peak at a lower molecular weight. But here, both LC peaks have the same mass as expected, so maybe not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular formula and same physical properties except in chiral environments. So, the NMR would show identical shifts because enantiomers look the same in achiral conditions. Wait, but in the NMR, the same proton would be split into two if they're diastereotopic or something. Or wait, no. If the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show any splitting because enantiomers don't split each other's peaks. So I don't think B is correct because the NMR would show a single peak, not two.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling, like maybe a vicinal coupling? I'm a bit fuzzy on what 'double coupling' means. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of an amide where the proton is coupling with two different protons, but that would usually cause splitting, not two separate peaks. Hmm, not sure. Or perhaps it's something else, like a diastereomeric mixture. Wait, but then that would be an option D situation.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Oh, but wait, the two peaks in the NMR are for the same alpha-proton, so if the environment is slightly different, maybe their shifts are close but split into two. But why would that happen? Diastereomers would have different NMR signals for all protons, but in this case, only one proton shows two peaks. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the diastereomeric mixture causes some protons to be in similar environments but not identical.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So, same molecular weight, same mass spectrum. So, same molecular formula, same molecular weight, but different structures. So, if they're diastereomers, their MS would be the same because it's the same molecular weight. And in LC-MS, they would separate because their retention times are different. So that fits.

But why the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If the two diastereomers are present, then each would have a different environment for that alpha-proton. So, in a mixture, the NMR would show two peaks for that proton, each with their own shift. But wait, the question says the same alpha-proton. So, same proton in each diastereomer. But their environments would be different, causing different shifts. So the NMR would have two peaks at different shifts. But in the question, the two peaks are similar in shift. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because if the diastereomers are present, the shifts would be a bit different, perhaps, but maybe close enough that they look like two overlapping peaks. But in the question, it's two distinct peaks with similar shifts and same integral.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the diastereomers have the same proton, but the environment is slightly different. For example, if the compound has a stereocenter that's causing diastereomerism, but the same alpha-proton is present in both, with similar shifts.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let's think about the other options again. Option C, 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly clear on what that means. Maybe during a coupling reaction, some side products form with double bonds or something? Or perhaps it refers to a case where the proton is coupled to two different protons, leading to a doublet of doublets, but that would be one peak, not two. Or perhaps it's a situation where the proton is in a different environment due to some reaction byproduct.

Wait, another possibility is that the NMR is showing a splitting due to something else. But the question says that the coupling is ruled out. So, it's not due to spin-spin coupling. So, why are there two peaks? Maybe exchange processes? Or perhaps the compound is in a dynamic process, like some sort of equilibrium where the proton is in two different environments that are interconverting, leading to two peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the LC-MS having two equal peaks suggests that the compound is a racemic mixture. But wait, enantiomers would have the same mass, so the mass spec would match. But in that case, the NMR would not show two peaks for the same proton. Enantiomers are mirror images, so the same proton would have the same shift. So in the NMR, each proton's environment is identical, so it would appear as a single peak. But the question says there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So enantiomers don't seem to fit.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If it's a diastereomer, each diastereomer would have a different NMR. In the mixture, you'd see peaks from both. So if the same alpha-proton is present but in different environments, you would see two peaks. But why would the shifts be similar? Maybe the diastereomers are very similar in structure, so the shifts are close.

But why the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass? That's because diastereomers have the same molecular formula and same molecular weight. So that fits.

So, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton because it's a mixture of diastereomers. Each diastereomer has a slightly different environment for that proton, leading to two peaks with similar shifts but different enough to be distinct. The integrals add up to 1H because each diastereomer contributes one equivalent of that proton, and they're present in equal amounts.

So, looking back at the options, D is mixture of diastereoisomers. That seems to fit both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

Wait, but what about the possible other option, C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not entirely sure what that would look like. Maybe during the formation of the amide, some other bonds form, leading to a doublet. Or perhaps it's a case of the amide being formed in a way that leads to two different products, but I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the crude compound is a mixture of two diastereomers. So, the correct answer is D.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, and the LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the explanation for the duplicate peaks.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity are observed, both with the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule.
   - This indicates the same molecular formula and molecular weight for both components.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: Contaminated with a precursor**  
  A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct peak in the LC-MS spectrum. Since both peaks in the LC-MS have the same mass as the expected molecule, this explanation is unlikely.

- **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
  Enantiomers have identical physical properties, including NMR shifts, because they are non-superimposable mirror images. In an NMR spectrum, enantiomers would not produce two distinct peaks for the same proton. Thus, this option does not fit the observations.

- **Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond forming reaction**  
  The term "double coupling" is unclear, but it typically refers to spin-spin coupling involving two protons. However, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Without further evidence, this explanation is less likely.

- **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
  Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and would produce distinct NMR signals due to differences in their environments. In this case, the two peaks in the NMR spectrum correspond to the same alpha-proton in slightly different environments caused by the diastereomeric mixture. The LC-MS observations also align, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight and molecular formula, explaining the two peaks of equal intensity. This explanation fits both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS analyses.
