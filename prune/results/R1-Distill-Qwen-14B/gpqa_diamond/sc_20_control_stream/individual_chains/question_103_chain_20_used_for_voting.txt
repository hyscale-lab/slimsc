Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each listing a series of reagents and conditions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with a high yield.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, the benzene is attached to an ethanone group (a ketone with a methyl group, so it's acetophenone but substituted). Wait, wait, no—ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group (which is an acetyl group) attached to the benzene, probably in the 1-position. Wait, no: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5, and the ketone is attached to the same carbon as the benzene—so the structure is like Ph-C(O)-CH3, where Ph is the benzene with Br at position 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethanone is (CH3)2CO, but ethan-1-one would be CH3C(O)-R, where R is the aromatic group. So the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon (since it's ethan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1). So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the carbonyl group (as part of the acetyl) attached at position 1. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering. The benzene ring is connected to the acetyl group. So for the substituents, the acetyl is at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So the benzene has three substituents: acetyl at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5.

So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring. Wait, but if benzene is a six-membered ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 would be meta to each other, right? So the acetyl is at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3 (two carbons away), and nitro at 5 (four away, but in a ring, it's actually position 5 is across from position 1, so maybe it's adjacent to position 4? Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group. Let's think: the acetyl group is at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3 (two positions away), and nitro at position 5 (four positions away, but on the same ring, so it's across. Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other. So each substituent is separated by one carbon. That makes sense because 3 and 5 are meta to position 1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the benzene ring has an acetyl group, a Br, and a nitro group at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetyl. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group, which is at position 1.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. So I need to find a way to introduce these three substituents in the correct positions.

I remember that when substituents are introduced onto benzene, their positions relative to each other depend on the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.

Let me think about the directing effects of the various groups. The acetyl group is a meta-directing group (since it's an electron-withdrawing group, being a ketone). The nitro group is a strong meta director, and bromine is ortho/para directing but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (since it's a halide). Wait, no—bromine as a substituent is ortho/para directing but deactivating, because it's an electron-withdrawing via induction, but can donate electrons through resonance (though not as effectively as, say, an amino group). Wait, actually, no. Bromine is an ortho/para director but a deactivating group because the inductive effect (withdrawing) is stronger than the resonance effect (donating). So the substituents' directing effects are important here.

But wait, perhaps the order in which the substituents are introduced will determine their positions.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: Br at position 3, nitro at 5, and acetyl at 1. So perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, then nitro, then Br? Or another order.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the synthesis steps. Starting with benzene, the first substituent will be introduced. Let's say we introduce the acetyl group (COCH3) via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Benzene plus CH3COCl and AlCl3 as catalyst. That would give acetophenone. Now, acetophenone is a meta director. So the next substituent introduced would be directed to the meta position relative to the acetyl.

So, after acylation, the next step would be introducing another substituent. Let's say we introduce nitro group. Nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the acetyl. So, the nitro group would go into position 3 (if we consider the acetyl at position 1). Wait, but in the target molecule, nitro is at position 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order of substituent introduction. Let's think about the sequence.

The target molecule has three substituents: acetyl (position 1), Br (3), NO2 (5). So perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, then the nitro group, then the Br. But wait, wait—each substitution step depends on the previous groups.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the next substitution depends on the activating or deactivating nature and the directing effects of the existing groups. So, after the first substituent (acetyl, which is meta-directing), the next substituent (say, nitro) would be added in the meta position relative to the acetyl. But wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group and also meta-directing. So, when you add a nitro group after acetyl, it would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (position 1) and nitro (position 3). Now, the next substituent (Br) would be introduced. The directing effects of the existing groups would determine where it goes. But Br is an ortho/para director, but deactivating.

Wait, no, wait—Br is a substituent on the benzene ring, and when it's on the ring, it's ortho/para directing. But in this case, when you have multiple substituents, the most activating group would direct the next substitution. But acetyl is a meta director, and nitro is a meta director as well. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it's more deactivating than acetyl, perhaps.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about which groups are present during each substitution step. Let me outline possible steps.

Option B, for example, has the steps as:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene bromination.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

v) Fe/HCl → reduction?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → what's that? I think H3PO2 is used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and H3PO2. So that would remove the carbonyl group.

Wait, that can't be right because the target has a ketone. So perhaps that's a wrong sequence.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Benzene nitration gives nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine? Fe/HCl is a reducing environment, perhaps using H2O and heat to do a catalytic hydrogenation? Wait, nitro groups can be reduced to amines with Fe/HCl (like in the Rosenmund reduction or using H2 and a catalyst). So after nitration, reducing would give aniline.

Then iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → that's the Clemmensen reagent, which would reduce a ketone. But wait, how does that fit in?

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the steps for each option.

But perhaps I should approach this methodically. Let's consider each option and think about what each reaction does, and see which sequence leads to the desired product.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, in the benzene ring, the substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (position 3), and nitro (position 5). So these substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions relative to each other, meaning they are all meta to each other. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5 are all separated by two carbons. So each substituent is at every other position.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing substituents in a way that each new substituent is added meta to the existing one.

Let me think about the possible steps. Starting with benzene.

First, introduce a substituent. The first substituent could be the acetyl group. Then, the next substituent would go meta to it. Then, the third substituent would go meta to the second or relative to the first, depending on the directing effects.

Wait, but perhaps the order of introducing substituents is acetyl first, then nitro, then bromine. Alternatively, maybe acetyl, then bromine, then nitro. Hmm. Let me think about the directing effects.

Wait, another approach: the order of introduction of substituents will affect their positions. So, for substituents to end up in the 1,3,5 positions, perhaps each is added meta to the previous.

So, first, acetyl is added at position 1. Then, nitro is added meta to that, at position 3. But wait, then when adding the third substituent (Br), where would it go? It would have to go meta to nitro, which is position 5 (since nitro is at 3), so that would be position 5.

Wait, that sounds promising. So the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group at meta position (position 3).

3. Brominate the ring, which now has acetophenone (position 1) and nitro (position 3). The bromine would go where?

Wait, when you have two substituents, the next substituent is directed by the most activating group. Let's see: acetophenone is a meta director, and nitro is a meta director and deactivating. So the ring is deactivated, but the directing would be determined by the existing groups.

Wait, in acetophenone, the acetyl group is a meta director, so when you nitrate, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. So position 3.

Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, adding Br: Br is introduced via bromination (FeBr3 as catalyst). But in this case, the ring has two substituents—acetyl and nitro. Both are meta directors, but which one is more influential?

The acetyl group is activating (wait, no: acetyl is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group). Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acetyl group, which is a meta-directing, deactivating group. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

So when both are present, the most deactivating group would dominate? Or the more activating (if any) would? Or perhaps the substituents are in positions that allow for the next substituent to go into a position that's meta to both.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents' positions and their effects.

In the ring after acylation and nitration, we have acetyl at position 1, nitro at position 3.

Now, when we brominate, the bromine will go into a position that is ortho or para to one of the existing groups, but considering the directing effects and the ring's activation.

Wait, but both the acetyl and nitro are meta directors. So bromine would go into a position that's ortho or para to one of them, but since both are meta directors, perhaps the available positions are limited.

Wait, in the ring with substituents at 1 and 3, where can bromine go?

Looking at the ring, positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 are empty. Wait, the positions are numbered as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So if substituents are at 1 and 3, position 5 is two positions away from 3 (3→4→5), which is meta to 3. But 5 is also adjacent to 6, which is next to 1.

Wait, perhaps the bromine would go into position 5 because that's a meta position to the nitro group at position 3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The existing groups are acetyl (1) and nitro (3). When adding Br, which is ortho/para to which group?

Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director itself. Wait, but Br is being introduced as a substituent into the ring. So in this scenario, where would it go? Let me think about the directing effects of the existing groups.

The acetyl at 1 is a meta director, so any new substituent would go meta to it, but the nitro at 3 is also a meta director. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of multiple substituents, the next substituent is directed to the position that is ortho or para to the most activating group. But in this case, both groups are deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the positions available are limited. Let's imagine the ring: positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 is empty. So, when adding Br, the available positions are 2, 4, 5, 6. But considering the directing effects.

Since both existing substituents are meta directors, the new substituent (Br) would go into a position that is meta to each of them. Wait, but that's not possible unless all three are in a symmetric position. Alternatively, perhaps the Br goes into position 5, which is meta to nitro (at 3) and para to acetyl (at 1). Because position 5 is para to position 1 (since 1 and 5 are across each other in a benzene ring).

Wait, but bromine is an ortho/para director. So perhaps it would prefer to go into positions ortho or para to the existing groups.

Wait, but after acylation and nitration, the ring is highly deactivating. So the ring may not undergo further substitution easily, but perhaps in this case, it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is different. Instead of adding nitro after acetyl, perhaps we add Br first.

Wait, that's another possibility. Let's think about introducing Br first. So benzene brominated (using FeBr3) would give bromobenzene. Then, what's next?

Bromobenzene is ortho/para directing. So if we then nitrate it, the nitro group would go into the ortho or para position relative to Br.

Wait, but the target has Br and nitro in positions 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. Wait, no, if Br is at position 3, nitro would be at 5, which is meta to Br. But in that case, nitro would be meta to Br. Wait, but if bromobenzene is nitrated, the nitro could go para to Br (position 5 if Br is at position 3, because benzene is a ring). Wait, position 3 and 5 are meta to each other, but in a ring, para to position 3 is position 7, which doesn't exist. Wait, no: in benzene, each position has ortho (next), meta (two away), and para (opposite). So for position 3, para is position 6. So nitration of bromobenzene would typically give nitro groups at positions 2 and 6 (ortho and para to Br). But the target has nitro at position 5 relative to the acetyl group, which is a different matter.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't the right way. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of reagents. Let's look for the likely order of substituent introduction.

The target has acetyl, Br, and nitro. Now, the nitro group is usually introduced via nitration, which is a strong reaction. The acetyl is via Friedel-Crafts acylation.

But Friedel-Crafts won't work on a strongly deactivating ring. So if the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts (which requires activating groups) won't proceed. So the acylation needs to happen before any nitration or bromination steps that would deactivate the ring.

Ah, that's a key point. So the acetyl group (from Friedel-Crafts) must be introduced before any nitration or bromination steps that would deactivate the ring. Because once the ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So the first step must be the acylation (Friedel-Crafts), because other steps like nitration would deactivate the ring, making it impossible to perform Friedel-Crafts later.

So looking at the options, the first step must be acylation. Let's check each option.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → yes, acylation. Then steps ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Etc.

Option B: First step is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So acylation is step iii). But that's after nitration steps, which is impossible because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

Option C: First step is HNO3 → nitration. Then Fe/HCl (possibly reduction of nitro to amine). Then acylation. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so acylation (Friedel-Crafts) won't work. So option C is probably wrong.

Option D: First step HNO3 → nitration. Then Fe/HCl → reduction to amine. Then NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Then H3PO2 → Clemmensen reduction (which reduces ketones to CH2 groups). But in this case, the acylation hasn't happened, so perhaps option D is not correct.

So, only option A and option B have acylation as step i) and step iii) respectively.

Wait, in option B, acylation is step iii), which would be after bromination and nitration. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. So if the ring has nitro groups (from step ii), which are deactivating, the acylation in step iii) would not proceed. So option B is wrong.

So the correct sequence must have acylation as the first step, perhaps.

So option A: steps i) acylation, ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4, etc.

Wait, but after acylation, the ring is deactivating, so nitration (step iii) can proceed. Let's see.

So after acylation (step i), the ring has acetyl at position 1. Then step ii is bromination. Bromination in presence of acetyl (meta director) would add Br at position 3. Then step iii is nitration. Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3.

Wait, but in this case, where would the nitro group go? The existing substituents are acetyl (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director). So when nitrating, the nitro group would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, perhaps the nitration step would add the nitro group in a position that's meta to the acetyl, which is position 5, because position 3 is already occupied by Br.

Wait, let me think. After step ii, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Now, step iii is nitration. The nitration would be directed by the existing groups.

The acetyl group is a strong meta director, and the Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So which group would dominate the direction of the nitration?

Since the acetyl is a meta director, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to it. So from position 1, meta is position 4 and position... Wait, benzene is a ring, so meta to 1 would be positions 3 and 5. But position 3 is already occupied by Br, so nitration would occur at position 5.

That's exactly what we need! So the nitro group would be at position 5, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and also adjacent to Br (position 3) in a way that they are meta to each other (3 and 5 are two positions apart, which is meta).

So the sequence in option A would be: acylation→bromination→nitration.

But wait, option A has more steps than that. Let me look at the entire sequence for option A.

Option A: i) acylation; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that seems longer than necessary. Let me see. After steps i, ii, iii, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target. So why are there more steps?

Wait, perhaps the subsequent steps are for some other reaction, but in the target molecule, those groups are already present. So perhaps option A is not the correct order.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me think again about each option's steps.

Wait, the target molecule only has acetyl, Br, and nitro. So any steps after that would have to modify these groups, but the options include steps like reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and H3PO2 (Clemmensen). Those steps might remove substituents or change their positions.

Wait, but the target has nitro and Br, so perhaps some steps are for introducing those groups.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me think about option B.

Option B's steps: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene. Then ii) nitration → nitro at para to Br (positions 3 and 6 in bromobenzene). Then iii) acylation → but wait, if the ring is already nitrated, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option B is not correct.

Option C: i) nitration → nitrobenzene. Then ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline). iii) acylation → acetylation of amine? No, because after reduction, you have an amine group, which is a strong activating group. So acylation via Friedel-Crafts might not work because the amine is a strong activating group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done via an acetylation reaction, like using acetic anhydride, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, perhaps after reducing the nitro group to amine, you can acetylate it. But then, the acetyl would be on the amine, not on the ring.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the target molecule has the acetyl on the ring. So option C is probably wrong.

Option D: i) nitration → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline). iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. iv) H3PO2 → Clemmensen, which would reduce any carbonyl groups to CH2, but how would that help if we don't have any carbonyl yet? Hmm, perhaps this option is more about introducing substituents via diazonium salts.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this from another angle.

The target molecule has three substituents: Br, nitro, and acetyl. Let's think about the order in which these groups are introduced. Since acylation must be done before any deactivating steps (like nitration), the first step must be acylation.

So the first step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3). So the first step must be i) in option A, which starts with that.

After acylation, the ring has acetyl at position 1. Next, we need to introduce Br and nitro. But where?

Wait, the next step in option A is bromination (step ii). So bromobenzene would have Br at position 3, meta to acetyl. Then, step iii is nitration. Since the ring now has acetyl (1) and Br (3), the nitro group would go into the position meta to acetyl, which is position 5 (since position 3 is already occupied by Br). So after step iii, the ring has acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). That's exactly the target structure.

So the first three steps (i, ii, iii) in option A produce the desired product. But option A has more steps after that.

Wait, but the target is achieved after step iii. Why are there more steps? Let me look at option A's steps again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → could be reduction.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again, but we don't need more nitro groups.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → Clemmensen reduction.

This seems like it's adding more substituents or modifying existing ones, which is not needed. So perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Another possibility is that the nitro group is introduced after the bromine, but that would require the ring to be active enough to allow Friedel-Crafts, which it's not if nitro is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetyl first, then nitro, then bromine. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so after introducing nitro, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine is introduced after the nitro. But again, after nitro, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method, not via electrophilic substitution. But I don't think so—it's usually introduced via electrophilic substitution with FeBr3.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: starts with bromination (step i), then nitration (step ii), then acylation (step iii). But as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option B is wrong.

Option D: starts with nitration (step i), then reduction (step ii) to amine, then diazotization (step iii), then Clemmensen (step iv). Then bromine (step v), acylation (step vi), and nitration (step vii). But this seems to involve a lot of steps and possibly incorrect directing.

Option C: Starts with nitration, then reduction to amine, then acylation. But acylation after nitration won't work because the ring is deactivated.

So perhaps the correct option is option B, but I was wrong earlier. Let me reevaluate. Let's consider option B's steps in more detail.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where does the nitro group go? Bromobenzene is ortho/para directing. So nitration would likely add nitro at ortho or para to Br. So if Br is at position 1, nitro could go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, the nitro is at position 5 relative to acetyl, which is position 1. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Wait, but after nitration, in step iii of option B, it's acylation. But as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. Thus, option B is incorrect.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method. For example, using a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps steps involve nitration, reduction to amine, then diazotization and coupling. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, then nitration, then bromination. But after acylation and nitration, can bromine be introduced?

Wait, after acylation, the ring is meta director. Introducing nitro via nitration (step iii) would add it at position 5. Then, bromination would add at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl.

Wait, but in that case, the order would be acylation, nitration, bromination. Let me think about that.

So step i: acylation → acetyl at 1.

Step ii: nitration → nitro at 5.

Step iii: bromination → where? The ring now has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 5. Both are meta directors. So the available positions for Br would be 3, which is meta to acetyl and ortho to nitro.

Wait, but in that case, Br would go to position 3, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and ortho to nitro (position 5). So that would give the required structure.

So the steps would be: acylation → nitration → bromination. But looking at the options, which option follows this order?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So in that case, nitro would be added after Br, which would go to position 5.

Wait, but in option A, step iii is nitration after bromination. So the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). When nitrated, nitro would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl). So that's correct.

But then why are there more steps after that in option A? Because the problem states the target is achieved, and any additional steps would not contribute to the product. So perhaps the extra steps are irrelevant or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but the target molecule only requires three substituents. So once steps i, ii, and iii in option A are done, the target is achieved. So why are there more steps?

Looking back at the question, it says "the sequence of reactions" that would lead to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes exactly the steps needed, without any extra steps that would alter the product.

Wait, but option A has more steps. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: the target has the nitro group at position 5 relative to the acetyl. So perhaps the nitro group was introduced before the bromine. But if that's the case, after acylation, nitration would add nitro at position 3, and then bromine would go to position 5.

Wait, but that would depend on the order of substituents.

Wait, let me think. If after acylation (step i), I nitrate (step ii), the nitro would go to position 3. Then, bromination (step iii) would add Br at position 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3). In this case, the target would have acetyl at 1, nitro at 3, Br at 5. But the target requires Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is acylation, nitration, then bromination, as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option B. Let me think again.

Option B's steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro at para (position 5 if Br is at 1).

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So this step wouldn't proceed.

So option B is not possible.

Thus, the only option that makes sense is option A, which starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. These three steps would give the target molecule.

But why does option A have more steps? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about each step in option A in more detail.

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br adds meta to acetyl, position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro adds meta to acetyl, which is position 5.

At this point, the target is achieved. The rest of the steps (iv to vii) are additional reactions. But why would they be part of the correct sequence? Unless those steps are involved in some way that I'm not considering.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which has the acetyl group attached to the benzene ring. So perhaps steps iv to vii are for something else, like protecting groups or other modifications. But in the context of the question, the target is achieved after step iii. So the correct sequence would be steps i, ii, iii, and the rest are irrelevant or incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that the sequence should lead to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituent introduction. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group must be introduced after the bromine. Let me see.

After acylation (step i), the ring is acetylated. Then bromination (step ii) adds Br at position 3. Then nitration (step iii) adds nitro at position 5. That's correct.

So the first three steps in option A achieve the target. The subsequent steps would have to be for something else, but the question only asks for the synthesis of the target molecule, so perhaps the correct option is A, but only considering the first three steps. But the options list all the steps as part of the sequence, so perhaps the presence of extra steps invalidates option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps. Let me look again at option B.

Wait, perhaps option B is a trick. Let's think about the steps in option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → para nitro to Br.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But as I thought earlier, the ring is deactivated due to nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option B is incorrect.

Given all that, I think option A is the correct one because the first three steps produce the target, and the extra steps may not be necessary or might even be incorrect. But actually, the question is to choose the correct sequence that leads to the product, so perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B's steps after acylation might not make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a nitronium salt under different conditions, but I don't think that changes the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a diazonium salt. Let me see. For example, after bromination, you could nitrate, then acetylate, but that doesn't fit with the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different position due to steric hindrance or other factors. But I'm not sure.

After much consideration, I think the correct sequence is option B. Wait, no, earlier analysis said option B can't proceed because Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitration.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the extra steps. But the problem states the high-yield synthesis, implying the minimal necessary steps. So perhaps option A is correct.

Wait, wait, the target is achieved after step iii in option A. The other steps (iv to vii) in option A might be for something else, but the question is about the overall sequence. So perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize the amine to form a diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → reduce the diazonium salt (Clemmensen) → this typically converts the diazonium salt to a benzene ring with a hydrogen. But where would the substituents come in?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For example, a diazonium salt can be coupled with another aromatic ring, but in this case, perhaps it's used to introduce a substituent.

Wait, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's treated with H3PO2, which is a mild reducing agent. But I'm not sure how that would help in introducing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is decomposed under certain conditions to introduce a substituent. But I'm not clear on this.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should conclude that option B is the correct answer, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, no. Let's think about the substituent positions again. The target has the acetyl group at position 1, nitro at 5, and Br at 3. That implies that the substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to the others. So the order must be acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. But after acylation, nitration would require the ring to be in a state that allows nitration, which it is. So the steps would be: acylation → nitration → bromination. Does any option follow this order?

Looking at the options, option A's steps are acylation → bromination → nitration. So nitro is added after Br. So nitro would be added to position 5 (meta to acetyl). So that's correct. So option A's first three steps give the target. The remaining steps are not needed, but perhaps the question includes all the steps regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the nitro group is introduced via another method. But no, the options are given, so I have to choose from them.

Thus, the correct answer is option B. Wait, no—option B's first step is bromination, which would make the acylation step (step iii) impossible because the ring is deactivated.

So, after reevaluating, the correct option must be option B is incorrect, option A is the only one that starts with acylation, which is necessary.

So, the correct answer is option B? No, option A.

Wait, no. Option A is the only one that starts with acylation. So the correct sequence is option A, steps i, ii, iii. The rest of the steps in option A may not be needed, but perhaps they are part of the overall process. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct option is A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro) in the correct positions (1, 3, and 5, respectively). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃)**: This reaction introduces the acetyl group onto the benzene ring. It must occur early in the synthesis because the acetyl group is a meta-directing, deactivating group, and subsequent reactions like nitration or bromination require the ring to remain reactive.
2. **Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃)**: Bromine is introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution. The bromine substituent is ortho/para-directing but deactivating.
3. **Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄)**: The nitro group is introduced via nitration. It is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
4. **Order of Substituents**: The acetyl group must be introduced first to ensure the ring remains reactive for subsequent substitutions. The nitro group should be introduced next, as it is meta to the acetyl group. Finally, bromine is added, which is meta to the acetyl group and ortho to the nitro group.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Step i**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1.
- **Step ii**: Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromination adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).
- **Step iii**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group and ortho to the bromine).
- **Steps iv–vii**: Additional steps (Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary for the target product and do not contribute to the synthesis.

This sequence correctly produces the target molecule after the first three steps.

#### **Option B**:
- **Step i**: Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.
- **Step ii**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (para to bromine).
- **Step iii**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.

This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation fails after nitration.

#### **Option C**:
- **Step i**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
- **Step ii**: Fe/HCl → Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
- **Step iii**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acylation cannot proceed because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.

This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation fails after nitration.

#### **Option D**:
- **Step i**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
- **Step ii**: Fe/HCl → Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
- **Step iii**: NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotization forms a diazonium salt.
- **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ → Clemmensen reduction removes the diazonium salt, leaving a hydrogen atom.
- **Step v**: Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromination introduces bromine.
- **Step vi**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acylation cannot proceed because the ring is deactivated.
- **Step vii**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Additional nitration is unnecessary and incorrect.

This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation fails after nitration.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as the first three steps (accretion, bromination, and nitration) successfully produce the target molecule, and the additional steps are irrelevant or incorrect.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each listing a series of reagents and conditions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with a high yield.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, the benzene is attached to an ethanone group (a ketone with a methyl group, so it's acetophenone but substituted). Wait, wait, no—ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group (which is an acetyl group) attached to the benzene, probably in the 1-position. Wait, no: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5, and the ketone is attached to the same carbon as the benzene—so the structure is like Ph-C(O)-CH3, where Ph is the benzene with Br at position 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethanone is (CH3)2CO, but ethan-1-one would be CH3C(O)-R, where R is the aromatic group. So the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon (since it's ethan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1). So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the carbonyl group (as part of the acetyl) attached at position 1. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering. The benzene ring is connected to the acetyl group. So for the substituents, the acetyl is at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So the benzene has three substituents: acetyl at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5.

So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring. Wait, but if benzene is a six-membered ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 would be meta to each other, right? So the acetyl is at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3 (two carbons away), and nitro at 5 (four away, but in a ring, it's actually position 5 is across from position 1, so maybe it's adjacent to position 4? Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group. Let's think: the acetyl group is at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3 (two positions away), and nitro at position 5 (four positions away, but on the same ring, so it's across. Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other. So each substituent is separated by one carbon. That makes sense because 3 and 5 are meta to position 1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the benzene ring has an acetyl group, a Br, and a nitro group at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetyl. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group, which is at position 1.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. So I need to find a way to introduce these three substituents in the correct positions.

I remember that when substituents are introduced onto benzene, their positions relative to each other depend on the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.

Let me think about the directing effects of the various groups. The acetyl group is a meta-directing group (since it's an electron-withdrawing group, being a ketone). The nitro group is a strong meta director, and bromine is ortho/para directing but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (since it's a halide). Wait, no—bromine as a substituent is ortho/para directing but deactivating, because it's an electron-withdrawing via induction, but can donate electrons through resonance (though not as effectively as, say, an amino group). Wait, actually, no. Bromine is an ortho/para director but a deactivating group because the inductive effect (withdrawing) is stronger than the resonance effect (donating). So the substituents' directing effects are important here.

But wait, perhaps the order in which the substituents are introduced will determine their positions.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: Br at position 3, nitro at 5, and acetyl at 1. So perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, then nitro, then Br? Or another order.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the synthesis steps. Starting with benzene, the first substituent will be introduced. Let's say we introduce the acetyl group (COCH3) via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Benzene plus CH3COCl and AlCl3 as catalyst. That would give acetophenone. Now, acetophenone is a meta director. So the next substituent introduced would be directed to the meta position relative to the acetyl.

So, after acylation, the next step would be introducing another substituent. Let's say we introduce nitro group. Nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the acetyl. So, the nitro group would go into position 3 (if we consider the acetyl at position 1). Wait, but in the target molecule, nitro is at position 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order of substituent introduction. Let's think about the sequence.

The target molecule has three substituents: acetyl (position 1), Br (3), NO2 (5). So perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, then the nitro group, then the Br. But wait, wait—each substitution step depends on the previous groups.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the next substitution depends on the activating or deactivating nature and the directing effects of the existing groups. So, after the first substituent (acetyl, which is meta-directing), the next substituent (say, nitro) would be added in the meta position relative to the acetyl. But wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group and also meta-directing. So, when you add a nitro group after acetyl, it would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (position 1) and nitro (position 3). Now, the next substituent (Br) would be introduced. The directing effects of the existing groups would determine where it goes. But Br is an ortho/para director, but deactivating.

Wait, no, wait—Br is a substituent on the benzene ring, and when it's on the ring, it's ortho/para directing. But in this case, when you have multiple substituents, the most activating group would direct the next substitution. But acetyl is a meta director, and nitro is a meta director as well. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it's more deactivating than acetyl, perhaps.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about which groups are present during each substitution step. Let me outline possible steps.

Option B, for example, has the steps as:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene bromination.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

v) Fe/HCl → reduction?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → what's that? I think H3PO2 is used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and H3PO2. So that would remove the carbonyl group.

Wait, that can't be right because the target has a ketone. So perhaps that's a wrong sequence.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Benzene nitration gives nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine? Fe/HCl is a reducing environment, perhaps using H2O and heat to do a catalytic hydrogenation? Wait, nitro groups can be reduced to amines with Fe/HCl (like in the Rosenmund reduction or using H2 and a catalyst). So after nitration, reducing would give aniline.

Then iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → that's the Clemmensen reagent, which would reduce a ketone. But wait, how does that fit in?

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the steps for each option.

But perhaps I should approach this methodically. Let's consider each option and think about what each reaction does, and see which sequence leads to the desired product.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, in the benzene ring, the substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (position 3), and nitro (position 5). So these substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions relative to each other, meaning they are all meta to each other. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5 are all separated by two carbons. So each substituent is at every other position.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing substituents in a way that each new substituent is added meta to the existing one.

Let me think about the possible steps. Starting with benzene.

First, introduce a substituent. The first substituent could be the acetyl group. Then, the next substituent would go meta to it. Then, the third substituent would go meta to the second or relative to the first, depending on the directing effects.

Wait, but perhaps the order of introducing substituents is acetyl first, then nitro, then bromine. Alternatively, maybe acetyl, then bromine, then nitro. Hmm. Let me think about the directing effects.

Wait, another approach: the order of introduction of substituents will affect their positions. So, for substituents to end up in the 1,3,5 positions, perhaps each is added meta to the previous.

So, first, acetyl is added at position 1. Then, nitro is added meta to that, at position 3. But wait, then when adding the third substituent (Br), where would it go? It would have to go meta to nitro, which is position 5 (since nitro is at 3), so that would be position 5.

Wait, that sounds promising. So the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group at meta position (position 3).

3. Brominate the ring, which now has acetophenone (position 1) and nitro (position 3). The bromine would go where?

Wait, when you have two substituents, the next substituent is directed by the most activating group. Let's see: acetophenone is a meta director, and nitro is a meta director and deactivating. So the ring is deactivated, but the directing would be determined by the existing groups.

Wait, in acetophenone, the acetyl group is a meta director, so when you nitrate, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. So position 3.

Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, adding Br: Br is introduced via bromination (FeBr3 as catalyst). But in this case, the ring has two substituents—acetyl and nitro. Both are meta directors, but which one is more influential?

The acetyl group is activating (wait, no: acetyl is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group). Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acetyl group, which is a meta-directing, deactivating group. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

So when both are present, the most deactivating group would dominate? Or the more activating (if any) would? Or perhaps the substituents are in positions that allow for the next substituent to go into a position that's meta to both.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents' positions and their effects.

In the ring after acylation and nitration, we have acetyl at position 1, nitro at position 3.

Now, when we brominate, the bromine will go into a position that is ortho or para to one of the existing groups, but considering the directing effects and the ring's activation.

Wait, but both the acetyl and nitro are meta directors. So bromine would go into a position that's ortho or para to one of them, but since both are meta directors, perhaps the available positions are limited.

Wait, in the ring with substituents at 1 and 3, where can bromine go?

Looking at the ring, positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 are empty. Wait, the positions are numbered as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So if substituents are at 1 and 3, position 5 is two positions away from 3 (3→4→5), which is meta to 3. But 5 is also adjacent to 6, which is next to 1.

Wait, perhaps the bromine would go into position 5 because that's a meta position to the nitro group at position 3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The existing groups are acetyl (1) and nitro (3). When adding Br, which is ortho/para to which group?

Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director itself. Wait, but Br is being introduced as a substituent into the ring. So in this scenario, where would it go? Let me think about the directing effects of the existing groups.

The acetyl at 1 is a meta director, so any new substituent would go meta to it, but the nitro at 3 is also a meta director. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of multiple substituents, the next substituent is directed to the position that is ortho or para to the most activating group. But in this case, both groups are deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the positions available are limited. Let's imagine the ring: positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 is empty. So, when adding Br, the available positions are 2, 4, 5, 6. But considering the directing effects.

Since both existing substituents are meta directors, the new substituent (Br) would go into a position that is meta to each of them. Wait, but that's not possible unless all three are in a symmetric position. Alternatively, perhaps the Br goes into position 5, which is meta to nitro (at 3) and para to acetyl (at 1). Because position 5 is para to position 1 (since 1 and 5 are across each other in a benzene ring).

Wait, but bromine is an ortho/para director. So perhaps it would prefer to go into positions ortho or para to the existing groups.

Wait, but after acylation and nitration, the ring is highly deactivating. So the ring may not undergo further substitution easily, but perhaps in this case, it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is different. Instead of adding nitro after acetyl, perhaps we add Br first.

Wait, that's another possibility. Let's think about introducing Br first. So benzene brominated (using FeBr3) would give bromobenzene. Then, what's next?

Bromobenzene is ortho/para directing. So if we then nitrate it, the nitro group would go into the ortho or para position relative to Br.

Wait, but the target has Br and nitro in positions 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. Wait, no, if Br is at position 3, nitro would be at 5, which is meta to Br. But in that case, nitro would be meta to Br. Wait, but if bromobenzene is nitrated, the nitro could go para to Br (position 5 if Br is at position 3, because benzene is a ring). Wait, position 3 and 5 are meta to each other, but in a ring, para to position 3 is position 7, which doesn't exist. Wait, no: in benzene, each position has ortho (next), meta (two away), and para (opposite). So for position 3, para is position 6. So nitration of bromobenzene would typically give nitro groups at positions 2 and 6 (ortho and para to Br). But the target has nitro at position 5 relative to the acetyl group, which is a different matter.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't the right way. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of reagents. Let's look for the likely order of substituent introduction.

The target has acetyl, Br, and nitro. Now, the nitro group is usually introduced via nitration, which is a strong reaction. The acetyl is via Friedel-Crafts acylation.

But Friedel-Crafts won't work on a strongly deactivating ring. So if the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts (which requires activating groups) won't proceed. So the acylation needs to happen before any nitration or bromination steps that would deactivate the ring.

Ah, that's a key point. So the acetyl group (from Friedel-Crafts) must be introduced before any nitration or bromination steps that would deactivate the ring. Because once the ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So the first step must be the acylation (Friedel-Crafts), because other steps like nitration would deactivate the ring, making it impossible to perform Friedel-Crafts later.

So looking at the options, the first step must be acylation. Let's check each option.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → yes, acylation. Then steps ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Etc.

Option B: First step is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So acylation is step iii). But that's after nitration steps, which is impossible because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

Option C: First step is HNO3 → nitration. Then Fe/HCl (possibly reduction of nitro to amine). Then acylation. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so acylation (Friedel-Crafts) won't work. So option C is probably wrong.

Option D: First step HNO3 → nitration. Then Fe/HCl → reduction to amine. Then NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Then H3PO2 → Clemmensen reduction (which reduces ketones to CH2 groups). But in this case, the acylation hasn't happened, so perhaps option D is not correct.

So, only option A and option B have acylation as step i) and step iii) respectively.

Wait, in option B, acylation is step iii), which would be after bromination and nitration. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. So if the ring has nitro groups (from step ii), which are deactivating, the acylation in step iii) would not proceed. So option B is wrong.

So the correct sequence must have acylation as the first step, perhaps.

So option A: steps i) acylation, ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4, etc.

Wait, but after acylation, the ring is deactivating, so nitration (step iii) can proceed. Let's see.

So after acylation (step i), the ring has acetyl at position 1. Then step ii is bromination. Bromination in presence of acetyl (meta director) would add Br at position 3. Then step iii is nitration. Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3.

Wait, but in this case, where would the nitro group go? The existing substituents are acetyl (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director). So when nitrating, the nitro group would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, perhaps the nitration step would add the nitro group in a position that's meta to the acetyl, which is position 5, because position 3 is already occupied by Br.

Wait, let me think. After step ii, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Now, step iii is nitration. The nitration would be directed by the existing groups.

The acetyl group is a strong meta director, and the Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So which group would dominate the direction of the nitration?

Since the acetyl is a meta director, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to it. So from position 1, meta is position 4 and position... Wait, benzene is a ring, so meta to 1 would be positions 3 and 5. But position 3 is already occupied by Br, so nitration would occur at position 5.

That's exactly what we need! So the nitro group would be at position 5, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and also adjacent to Br (position 3) in a way that they are meta to each other (3 and 5 are two positions apart, which is meta).

So the sequence in option A would be: acylation→bromination→nitration.

But wait, option A has more steps than that. Let me look at the entire sequence for option A.

Option A: i) acylation; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that seems longer than necessary. Let me see. After steps i, ii, iii, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target. So why are there more steps?

Wait, perhaps the subsequent steps are for some other reaction, but in the target molecule, those groups are already present. So perhaps option A is not the correct order.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me think again about each option's steps.

Wait, the target molecule only has acetyl, Br, and nitro. So any steps after that would have to modify these groups, but the options include steps like reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and H3PO2 (Clemmensen). Those steps might remove substituents or change their positions.

Wait, but the target has nitro and Br, so perhaps some steps are for introducing those groups.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me think about option B.

Option B's steps: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene. Then ii) nitration → nitro at para to Br (positions 3 and 6 in bromobenzene). Then iii) acylation → but wait, if the ring is already nitrated, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option B is not correct.

Option C: i) nitration → nitrobenzene. Then ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline). iii) acylation → acetylation of amine? No, because after reduction, you have an amine group, which is a strong activating group. So acylation via Friedel-Crafts might not work because the amine is a strong activating group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done via an acetylation reaction, like using acetic anhydride, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, perhaps after reducing the nitro group to amine, you can acetylate it. But then, the acetyl would be on the amine, not on the ring.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the target molecule has the acetyl on the ring. So option C is probably wrong.

Option D: i) nitration → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline). iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. iv) H3PO2 → Clemmensen, which would reduce any carbonyl groups to CH2, but how would that help if we don't have any carbonyl yet? Hmm, perhaps this option is more about introducing substituents via diazonium salts.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this from another angle.

The target molecule has three substituents: Br, nitro, and acetyl. Let's think about the order in which these groups are introduced. Since acylation must be done before any deactivating steps (like nitration), the first step must be acylation.

So the first step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3). So the first step must be i) in option A, which starts with that.

After acylation, the ring has acetyl at position 1. Next, we need to introduce Br and nitro. But where?

Wait, the next step in option A is bromination (step ii). So bromobenzene would have Br at position 3, meta to acetyl. Then, step iii is nitration. Since the ring now has acetyl (1) and Br (3), the nitro group would go into the position meta to acetyl, which is position 5 (since position 3 is already occupied by Br). So after step iii, the ring has acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). That's exactly the target structure.

So the first three steps (i, ii, iii) in option A produce the desired product. But option A has more steps after that.

Wait, but the target is achieved after step iii. Why are there more steps? Let me look at option A's steps again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → could be reduction.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again, but we don't need more nitro groups.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → Clemmensen reduction.

This seems like it's adding more substituents or modifying existing ones, which is not needed. So perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Another possibility is that the nitro group is introduced after the bromine, but that would require the ring to be active enough to allow Friedel-Crafts, which it's not if nitro is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetyl first, then nitro, then bromine. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so after introducing nitro, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine is introduced after the nitro. But again, after nitro, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method, not via electrophilic substitution. But I don't think so—it's usually introduced via electrophilic substitution with FeBr3.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: starts with bromination (step i), then nitration (step ii), then acylation (step iii). But as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option B is wrong.

Option D: starts with nitration (step i), then reduction (step ii) to amine, then diazotization (step iii), then Clemmensen (step iv). Then bromine (step v), acylation (step vi), and nitration (step vii). But this seems to involve a lot of steps and possibly incorrect directing.

Option C: Starts with nitration, then reduction to amine, then acylation. But acylation after nitration won't work because the ring is deactivated.

So perhaps the correct option is option B, but I was wrong earlier. Let me reevaluate. Let's consider option B's steps in more detail.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where does the nitro group go? Bromobenzene is ortho/para directing. So nitration would likely add nitro at ortho or para to Br. So if Br is at position 1, nitro could go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, the nitro is at position 5 relative to acetyl, which is position 1. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Wait, but after nitration, in step iii of option B, it's acylation. But as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. Thus, option B is incorrect.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method. For example, using a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps steps involve nitration, reduction to amine, then diazotization and coupling. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, then nitration, then bromination. But after acylation and nitration, can bromine be introduced?

Wait, after acylation, the ring is meta director. Introducing nitro via nitration (step iii) would add it at position 5. Then, bromination would add at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl.

Wait, but in that case, the order would be acylation, nitration, bromination. Let me think about that.

So step i: acylation → acetyl at 1.

Step ii: nitration → nitro at 5.

Step iii: bromination → where? The ring now has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 5. Both are meta directors. So the available positions for Br would be 3, which is meta to acetyl and ortho to nitro.

Wait, but in that case, Br would go to position 3, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and ortho to nitro (position 5). So that would give the required structure.

So the steps would be: acylation → nitration → bromination. But looking at the options, which option follows this order?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So in that case, nitro would be added after Br, which would go to position 5.

Wait, but in option A, step iii is nitration after bromination. So the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). When nitrated, nitro would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl). So that's correct.

But then why are there more steps after that in option A? Because the problem states the target is achieved, and any additional steps would not contribute to the product. So perhaps the extra steps are irrelevant or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but the target molecule only requires three substituents. So once steps i, ii, and iii in option A are done, the target is achieved. So why are there more steps?

Looking back at the question, it says "the sequence of reactions" that would lead to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes exactly the steps needed, without any extra steps that would alter the product.

Wait, but option A has more steps. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: the target has the nitro group at position 5 relative to the acetyl. So perhaps the nitro group was introduced before the bromine. But if that's the case, after acylation, nitration would add nitro at position 3, and then bromine would go to position 5.

Wait, but that would depend on the order of substituents.

Wait, let me think. If after acylation (step i), I nitrate (step ii), the nitro would go to position 3. Then, bromination (step iii) would add Br at position 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3). In this case, the target would have acetyl at 1, nitro at 3, Br at 5. But the target requires Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is acylation, nitration, then bromination, as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option B. Let me think again.

Option B's steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro at para (position 5 if Br is at 1).

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So this step wouldn't proceed.

So option B is not possible.

Thus, the only option that makes sense is option A, which starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. These three steps would give the target molecule.

But why does option A have more steps? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about each step in option A in more detail.

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br adds meta to acetyl, position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro adds meta to acetyl, which is position 5.

At this point, the target is achieved. The rest of the steps (iv to vii) are additional reactions. But why would they be part of the correct sequence? Unless those steps are involved in some way that I'm not considering.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which has the acetyl group attached to the benzene ring. So perhaps steps iv to vii are for something else, like protecting groups or other modifications. But in the context of the question, the target is achieved after step iii. So the correct sequence would be steps i, ii, iii, and the rest are irrelevant or incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that the sequence should lead to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituent introduction. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group must be introduced after the bromine. Let me see.

After acylation (step i), the ring is acetylated. Then bromination (step ii) adds Br at position 3. Then nitration (step iii) adds nitro at position 5. That's correct.

So the first three steps in option A achieve the target. The subsequent steps would have to be for something else, but the question only asks for the synthesis of the target molecule, so perhaps the correct option is A, but only considering the first three steps. But the options list all the steps as part of the sequence, so perhaps the presence of extra steps invalidates option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps. Let me look again at option B.

Wait, perhaps option B is a trick. Let's think about the steps in option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → para nitro to Br.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But as I thought earlier, the ring is deactivated due to nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option B is incorrect.

Given all that, I think option A is the correct one because the first three steps produce the target, and the extra steps may not be necessary or might even be incorrect. But actually, the question is to choose the correct sequence that leads to the product, so perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B's steps after acylation might not make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a nitronium salt under different conditions, but I don't think that changes the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a diazonium salt. Let me see. For example, after bromination, you could nitrate, then acetylate, but that doesn't fit with the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different position due to steric hindrance or other factors. But I'm not sure.

After much consideration, I think the correct sequence is option B. Wait, no, earlier analysis said option B can't proceed because Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitration.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the extra steps. But the problem states the high-yield synthesis, implying the minimal necessary steps. So perhaps option A is correct.

Wait, wait, the target is achieved after step iii in option A. The other steps (iv to vii) in option A might be for something else, but the question is about the overall sequence. So perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize the amine to form a diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → reduce the diazonium salt (Clemmensen) → this typically converts the diazonium salt to a benzene ring with a hydrogen. But where would the substituents come in?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For example, a diazonium salt can be coupled with another aromatic ring, but in this case, perhaps it's used to introduce a substituent.

Wait, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's treated with H3PO2, which is a mild reducing agent. But I'm not sure how that would help in introducing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is decomposed under certain conditions to introduce a substituent. But I'm not clear on this.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should conclude that option B is the correct answer, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, no. Let's think about the substituent positions again. The target has the acetyl group at position 1, nitro at 5, and Br at 3. That implies that the substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to the others. So the order must be acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. But after acylation, nitration would require the ring to be in a state that allows nitration, which it is. So the steps would be: acylation → nitration → bromination. Does any option follow this order?

Looking at the options, option A's steps are acylation → bromination → nitration. So nitro is added after Br. So nitro would be added to position 5 (meta to acetyl). So that's correct. So option A's first three steps give the target. The remaining steps are not needed, but perhaps the question includes all the steps regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the nitro group is introduced via another method. But no, the options are given, so I have to choose from them.

Thus, the correct answer is option B. Wait, no—option B's first step is bromination, which would make the acylation step (step iii) impossible because the ring is deactivated.

So, after reevaluating, the correct option must be option B is incorrect, option A is the only one that starts with acylation, which is necessary.

So, the correct answer is option B? No, option A.

Wait, no. Option A is the only one that starts with acylation. So the correct sequence is option A, steps i, ii, iii. The rest of the steps in option A may not be needed, but perhaps they are part of the overall process. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct option is A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro) in the correct positions (1, 3, and 5, respectively). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃)**: This reaction introduces the acetyl group onto the benzene ring. It must occur early in the synthesis because the acetyl group is a meta-directing, deactivating group, and subsequent reactions like nitration or bromination require the ring to remain reactive.
2. **Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃)**: Bromine is introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution. The bromine substituent is ortho/para-directing but deactivating.
3. **Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄)**: The nitro group is introduced via nitration. It is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
4. **Order of Substituents**: The acetyl group must be introduced first to ensure the ring remains reactive for subsequent substitutions. The nitro group should be introduced next, as it is meta to the acetyl group. Finally, bromine is added, which is meta to the acetyl group and ortho to the nitro group.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Step i**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1.
- **Step ii**: Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromination adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).
- **Step iii**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group and ortho to the bromine).
- **Steps iv–vii**: Additional steps (Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary for the target product and do not contribute to the synthesis.

This sequence correctly produces the target molecule after the first three steps.

#### **Option B**:
- **Step i**: Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.
- **Step ii**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (para to bromine).
- **Step iii**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.

This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation fails after nitration.

#### **Option C**:
- **Step i**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
- **Step ii**: Fe/HCl → Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
- **Step iii**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acylation cannot proceed because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.

This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation fails after nitration.

#### **Option D**:
- **Step i**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
- **Step ii**: Fe/HCl → Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
- **Step iii**: NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotization forms a diazonium salt.
- **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ → Clemmensen reduction removes the diazonium salt, leaving a hydrogen atom.
- **Step v**: Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromination introduces bromine.
- **Step vi**: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acylation cannot proceed because the ring is deactivated.
- **Step vii**: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Additional nitration is unnecessary and incorrect.

This sequence is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts acylation fails after nitration.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as the first three steps (accretion, bromination, and nitration) successfully produce the target molecule, and the additional steps are irrelevant or incorrect.

**Answer: A**
