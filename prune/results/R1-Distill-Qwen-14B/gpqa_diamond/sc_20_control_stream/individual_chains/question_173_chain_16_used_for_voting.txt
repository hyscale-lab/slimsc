Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given its speed and the uncertainty in its location.

Let me see. The problem states that the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, 0.1 nanometers is 0.1e-9 meters. Right.

I think the Uncertainty Principle equation is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes people just use the approximation ΔxΔp ≈ ħ/2, or even just ΔxΔp ≈ ħ for an estimate when dealing with minimum uncertainties. So I should probably go with the latter for an approximate calculation.

So first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so Δp would be the uncertainty in momentum. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, but electrons have mass. The mass of an electron is about 9.11e-31 kilograms, right? So m = 9.11e-31 kg.

So the velocity is given as 2e8 m/s. Hmm, but wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 2e8 is less than that, so relativistic effects shouldn't matter much here. So non-relativistic equations should work.

But wait, wait. Oh, but the problem is about the uncertainty in energy, not the kinetic energy. Or is it? Because the question says 'minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron.' Hmm, energy uncertainty could relate to the momentum uncertainty via the energy-momentum relation. But wait, for a free particle, the energy is the kinetic energy, which is (p²)/(2m). So maybe I can use that.

Wait, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy, so ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m). Alternatively, using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the time-energy uncertainty principle says ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2, but I don't have a time uncertainty here. So perhaps the approach is to find Δp from Δx, then relate Δp to ΔE.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using Δx ≈ ħ / Δp → Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

Wait, Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 → so the minimum Δp is ħ/(2Δx). So perhaps I should use Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) to find the minimum Δp.

Wait, but for the minimum uncertainty, I think the product is equal to ħ/2, so Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Once I have Δp, I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp)^2/(2m). Alternatively, if the electron's speed is given, maybe I should consider relativistic energy, but I think non-relativistic is sufficient here.

Wait, so let me compute Δp first.

Given:
Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters = 1e-10 meters.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = (1.0545e-34) / (2e-10) ) = 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), so the uncertainty in kinetic energy would be (Δp)^2 / (2m).

Let me compute this:

ΔE = ( (5.27e-25)^2 ) / ( 2 * 9.11e-31 ) )

Calculating numerator: (5.27e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 * 1e-50 = approx 27.77 * 1e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So ΔE = (2.777e-49) / (1.822e-30) ) = (2.777 / 1.822) * 1e-19 ≈ 1.524 * 1e-19 J.

Wait, 2.777 divided by 1.822 is approximately 1.524. So 1.524e-19 J. But let me think about the exponents: 1e-49 / 1e-30 is 1e-19.

So that's about 1.5e-19 J. Looking at the options:

A) ~1e-18 J → 1e-18 is ten times bigger than 1.5e-19.

B) ~1e-17 → way bigger.

C) ~1e-19 → our calculation is about 1.5e-19, so closest to 1e-19.

D) 1e-16 → much larger.

So the answer should be option C, ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, did I account for all factors correctly? Let me double-check. The Heisenberg principle gives Δp as approximately ħ/(2Δx). Did I compute that correctly?

Yes, ħ is about 1e-34, divided by 2e-10 gives 5e-25 kg·m/s. Then, (5e-25)^2 is 25e-50, divided by 1.8e-30 gives 25e-50 / 1.8e-30 = (25/1.8) * 1e-20 → about 13.89e-20 = 1.389e-19. Oh wait, that's about 1.4e-19, which is roughly in line with my earlier calculation of 1.5e-19. So that's option C, which is ~1e-19 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used Δp ≈ ħ/Δx (without the 2). Let me try that approach.

If Δp = ħ / Δx, then:

Δp = 1.05e-34 / 1e-10 = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

Then, ΔE = (1.05e-24)^2 / (2 *9.11e-31 )

(1.05e-24)^2 = (1.1025e-48 )

Denominator: 2 *9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So ΔE = 1.1025e-48 / 1.822e-30 ≈ (1.1025 / 1.822) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.605 * 1e-18 → 6.05e-19 J. That's about 6e-19, which is still around 6e-19 J. So this approach gives a larger value, but it's still in the same order of magnitude as before. So whether using ħ/(2Δx) or ħ/Δx, the result is approximately 1e-19 J, so the correct option is C.

Wait, but why did I get a difference in the value? Because the factor of 2. Hmm. So perhaps I should have used Δp = ħ/(2Δx) which leads to about 1.5e-19, which is 1.5e-19 J. So the closest option is C, which is ~1e-19 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relativistic relation, but I don't think so because the speed is 2e8 m/s, which is about 2/3 the speed of light (3e8), so relativistic effects would be noticeable, but perhaps not too much. Wait, but the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1 ) mc². Hmm, but I think the problem expects a non-relativistic approach since it's an uncertainty principle question, and the given speed is 2e8, which is quite high, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute the relativistic gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given v = 2e8 m/s, c is 3e8, so v/c is 2/3.

So v/c = 0.666... So v²/c² is (4/9). 1 - 4/9 = 5/9. sqrt(5/9) is sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 2.236/3 ≈ 0.745. So 1/0.745 ≈ 1.342. So gamma is about 1.342.

So relativistic mass would be gamma * m. But since the problem is about the uncertainty in energy, which for a free particle is the kinetic energy, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². But wait, but the Heisenberg uncertainty would relate to the momentum uncertainty leading to energy uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is the same, because the kinetic energy's uncertainty is what's being calculated.

But for the sake of this problem, perhaps the non-relativistic approach is sufficient. Because even with gamma ≈ 1.34, the non-relativistic kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Let's compute that:

mv² = 9.11e-31 kg * (2e8)^2 = 9.11e-31 *4e16 = 3.644e-14 J.

So non-relativistic KE is (1/2)*3.644e-14 ≈ 1.82e-14 J. But the uncertainty ΔE we calculated is about 1.5e-19 J. Which is way smaller than the KE itself, so maybe the non-relativistic approach is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps in the relativistic case, the energy uncertainty would be different, but I think for our purposes, the non-relativistic approach suffices because the uncertainty is much smaller than the actual energy.

So going back, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1e-19 J, so the answer is option C.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron moving with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For the minimum uncertainty, we approximate:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) by the kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.524 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to the option \( \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
