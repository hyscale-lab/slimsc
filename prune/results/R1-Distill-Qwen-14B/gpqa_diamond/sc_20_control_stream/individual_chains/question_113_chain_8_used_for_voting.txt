Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one formula.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretches. A broad peak could mean either an alcohol (OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid (COOH) group because those have strong hydrogen bonding. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak, sometimes around 2500-3300. So that fits here. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H stretch is usually a bit lower, maybe 3200-3600. But the question says 'very broad' which makes me think maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is indicative of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an amide or maybe an ester or something else. Hmm. Wait, the 1650 could also be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituent causing a C=C stretch. But the 1700 is a strong carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyl groups. Like maybe an ester (which has a carbonyl around 1700) and another group, perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Or maybe a ketone and an ester. Alternatively, maybe one of them is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Let me think. Could the 1650 be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch? If so, that would fit with maybe a carbonyl group (like in an ester) and an aromatic ring.

But wait, the 1700 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group like ester or ketone. The 1650 might be conjugated, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe I'll come back to this.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in CH2=CH. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, probably in a vinyl group. So the structure might have a conjugated system, like maybe an ester with a double bond nearby, or perhaps an aromatic ring. Wait, no, aromatic protons would have their own shifts. But vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-7 ppm, depending on substitution and environment.

So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's a double bond in the molecule, like in an alkene. But how does that fit with the other data?

Then the Mass Spec: the fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is a significant mass. Let me think about possible fragments. The molecular ion might break into a smaller fragment. For example, in an ester, a common fragment is the acetyl group (CH3COO-), which is m/z 43, but wait, maybe not. Or perhaps a methyl group and another part. Alternatively, 45 could be something else. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (32 +13=45? Wait, no: carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So CH3COOH is 2*(12) +4*(1) +2*(16) = 24 +4 +32=60. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: m/z 45. Let's calculate possible fragments. 45 could be C3H7O+? Let me think: the molecular weight of C3H7O would be (3*12) +7 +16 = 36+7+16=60. No, wait, that's not right. Oh wait, perhaps it's another group. Maybe the fragment is something like (CH3)2CO+, which would be acetone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58 (12*3 + 6*1). No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a methyl ester fragment. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is methyl acrylate. Wait, the molecular formula for that would be C4H6O2. But our options are all C6, so that's not directly applicable. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a ketene ion? Or perhaps it's a cleavage in the molecule that produces a smaller ion.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be the result of losing a part of the molecule. Let's think about common cleavage points. For esters, the molecule might break at the ester group, leading to a fragment with the RCOO group and another with the R' group. For example, in an ester RCOOR', the cleavage could produce RCOO+ (which would have a molecular weight of (12+16+16 + (remainder from R)), but that's getting a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the possible formulas and see which one would give a fragment of 45. Let's list the possible formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be 6*12 +12 +2*16=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. MW=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72+12+16=100.

Hmm. So the molecular ion is likely to be one of these. Now, the Mass Spec fragment at 45 suggests that a part of the molecule has a molecular weight of 45. Let's see what 45 is. 45= (12a + b +16c)=45. Let's find possible combinations.

Option 1: a=2, b=5, c=2: 24 +5 +32=61. No.

Option 2: a=3, b=3, c=1: 36 +3 +16=55.

Option 3: a=1, b=15, c=2: 12 +15 +32=59. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe 45 comes from a group like C3H7O. Let's calculate that: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. Total 36+7+16=60. No, that's 60, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl-containing fragment. Like C2H3O2. Let me check: 2*12=24, 3=3, 32=32. 24+3+32=59. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a COO group that breaks off. The COO group is 12+16*2=44. Close to 45. Wait, but 44 is COO-, but maybe with an additional hydrogen? Or perhaps it's a methyl group attached. Maybe a fragment like CH2COOH? That would be 45: 12 (CH2) + 12 (COOH) + 16*2 (for the two O's in COOH) + 1 (H). Wait, but that would be 12 +12 +32 +1 = 57. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3COO- group. That's (12*2)+(16*2)=24 +32=56. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe a different approach. 45 could be the fragment that's a ketone. For example, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a molecular weight of 58. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: if the molecule is an ester, like RCOOR', and upon cleavage, it splits into RCOO and R' parts. Suppose the RCOO is 45. Let's see: RCOO- would be 45. R is an alkyl group. So RCOO would have formula CnH2nO2. So the molecular weight of RCOO- is 45. So the formula is CnH2nO2, which has a molecular weight of (12n) + (2n) + (32) = 45.

So 14n +32=45 → 14n=13 → n is about 0.9, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Another possibility: the fragment is a CH2=CHCOO− group. Wait, that would be (for CH2=CHCOO-) molecular weight: 12 (CH2) +12 (CH) +12 (COO) +2 (H2) + 1 (from CH) + etc. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion. Ketenes have the formula R-CO-C. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a carbonyl group and an adjacent group. Let me think about the possible options given the formulas.

Looking back, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

The presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. So let me consider each formula to see which includes such groups.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester (RCOOR'), which would have a carbonyl (so matches the 1700 cm-1 peak), and maybe an alcohol, but probably not. Or maybe it's a diester, but that's less common. Or perhaps a cyclic ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol. Hmm.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a smaller oxygen count, so possible functional groups could be a ketone and an alcohol, or an ester with one oxygen. Wait, but C6H10O would imply molecular formula with one O. So possible functional groups: ether, alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygen atoms. Possible functional groups could be ester, ketone, alcohol, carboxylic acid, or a combination like ester and alcohol. Or maybe a diester. Alternatively, it could have two ester groups, but that's less likely.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. So maybe an alcohol, ether, ketone, or aldehyde.

From the IR data, the 1700 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So any of the options with a carbonyl group would fit, except perhaps D if it's an alcohol without a carbonyl.

Wait, but D is C6H12O. So that's a possibility, perhaps a diol or something else without a carbonyl. But the IR has a 1700 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, so either A, C, or B must have a carbonyl. Wait, B is C6H10O. Could that have a carbonyl group? Let's see: for C6H10O, degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond.

So, in C6H10O, perhaps a carbonyl (one double bond) and a ring? Or two double bonds, but that's less likely. So possible structures: a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, but cyclohexanone has the formula C6H10O and a ketone group. So that would fit, but it wouldn't have an ester or an alcohol group. Let's see the IR data: The 1700 cm-1 would fit a ketone's carbonyl, which is around 1715 cm-1 but varies. So that's possible.

But the IR also has a broad peak at 3000. If B is a ketone, where would the broad peak come from? Unless there's an -OH group, which the formula doesn't allow for. Because B is C6H10O. So if it's a ketone, the O is in the carbonyl, so no -OH. Wait, no, the formula is C6H10O: that's one O. If it's a ketone, the O is used in the carbonyl, so no other O for an -OH. Therefore, the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 must be from another group, which can't be in B. So B is perhaps not the correct option.

So options A, C, D have O counts that would allow another group. Let's look again.

The IR has 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Let's consider each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So it could be a ring or a double bond. If it's an ester, which has a carbonyl, that's one double bond (or ring). So a possible structure could be an ester with a double bond elsewhere. For example, methyl vinyl something.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6+2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the structure must have a double bond, so at least one degree of unsaturation. So any option with less than that is out, but all options have at least one, except none of them. Wait, no, all have required.

But looking back, the broad peak suggests an -OH. So the structure must have an -OH group. So which options allow for that?

Option A: C6H12O2. Two O's. Could be an ester (which has O) and an -OH group, or perhaps another group. So maybe a diol with a carbonyl?

Wait, no. If it's an ester, that's OR and O from the carbonyl. Wait, an ester is RCOOR', so two O's. So if the formula is C6H12O2, that could be an ester and an -OH. But that would require three O's, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and an ester, but that would require three O's, but the formula has two. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) which has two O's. Then, where would an -OH come from? No, because the formula is C6H12O2, which would mean two O's. So if it's a lactone, that's one O from the ester, and perhaps another from an -OH. Wait, but that would require a formula with three O's.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think. Let's take each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups: ester (RCOOR') has two O's. So that's two O's. If the structure is an ester and an -OH, that would require three O's, which the formula doesn't have. So that can't be. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone), which has one O for the ester, but then no other O's, which wouldn't account for the two O's. Wait, so maybe another O comes from something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and an ester? No, that would require three O's. So this is confusing.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Could it have both an ester group and an -OH? Or a carboxylic acid and something else. Wait, a carboxylic acid has two O's in the COOH group. So C6H10O2 could be a carboxylic acid. Because the formula would fit: for a carboxylic acid, RCOOH, the formula would be (n carbons in R) + COOH. So for R being C5H9, the formula would be C6H10O2. That fits option C. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a broad peak due to the -COOH group. The 1700 and 1650 cm-1 peaks could correspond to the carbonyl (around 1700) and perhaps another peak from conjugation or an aromatic ring, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, is there another peak at 1650? I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, which would have a conjugated double bond leading to a shift in the carbonyl peak. Or perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but that would require an aromatic ring, which I'm not sure about.

Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens would imply a double bond, which would fit with an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOH, but that's only three carbons. Let me think of a six-carbon structure. Maybe something like CH2CH2COOH but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic structure, but not sure.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the structure must have a double bond, which a carboxylic acid with an alpha,beta double bond would have. So that might fit.

Then, the Mass Spec fragment at m/z=45. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps the molecule breaks to form a fragment with COOH. But that would have a higher molecular weight. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like CH2=CHCH2COOH, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the molecular formula. Suppose the compound is a carboxylic acid, C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114.

In the mass spec, a fragment at 45 suggests that a part of the molecule has a molecular weight of 45. Let me think of possible fragments. For example, if the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, that's 6 carbons. The fragment could be CH2=CHCH2+ (which is 45? Let me calculate: 3 carbons in CH2=CHCH2 would have a molecular weight of (3*12) + (5*1) = 36 +5=41, which is not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH2COOH, which is 45? Let me calculate: CH2COOH is 2 carbons plus COOH. Wait, molecular formula for CH2COOH would be C2H4O2. 2*12=24, 4=4, 32=32; total 24+4+32=60. No, that's 60, not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a different fragment. What if the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be an ester and the formula would be C7H10O2, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a double bond. Let's say it's methyl vinyl something. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our options are C6, so perhaps the ester is part of a larger molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's seven carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Let's say it's a five-membered ring. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a four-membered ring, but that's for a four-carbon molecule. A six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H10O2. Wait, let me check that. The formula for a lactone is CnH2nO2. For n=6, it would be C6H12O2. Hmm, but our option C is C6H10O2, which has two less hydrogens. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C7H10O2, which again doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dienolic acid or something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Another angle: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the structure has a double bond. The IR shows a broad peak (OH) and two carbonyls, perhaps a ketone and an ester, but the formula would have to fit.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ester, the molecular formula would be RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. The total O's are two, which fits. For example, R could be C3H5, R' C3H5. So RCOOR' would be C6H10O2. But wait, RCOOR' formula is (n + m + 2) O's? No, esters have two O's from the RCOO group and one from the OR', so total three O's. Wait, no, the ester functional group is RCOOR', which has two O's in the carbonyl and one O in the ester oxygen. So three O's in total, but option C has two O's. So that can't be right. So if the formula is C6H10O2 and it's an ester, that would require three O's, which would make the formula have three O's, so it's not possible. So option C can't be an ester.

Wait, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid has two O's in the COOH group. So the formula is C6H10O2. That would fit.

So the structure could be a carboxylic acid with a double bond. So for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That would be six carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

In the IR, the broad peak at 3000 would be from the -OH group of the carboxylic acid. The 1700 cm-1 would be the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm-1 could be from the conjugated double bond (alpha,beta-unsaturated acid), which might cause a shift in the carbonyl peak. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring, but without a ring, that's less likely.

The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens, which aligns with the presence of the double bond in the structure.

Now, the Mass Spec. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 could correspond to a fragment that's 45. Let's see: 114 - 45 = 69. So the molecule breaks into two parts, one of 45 and another of 69. The 45 could be from part of the molecule.

Alternatively, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, upon fragmentation, perhaps the COOH group (45?) would break off. Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which is 12 (C) + 2*(16) (O) + 2 (H2O?) Wait, no, COOH is 12 + 2*16 + 1*2 (from the OH) → 12 +32 +2=46. Hmm, close, but not exactly 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2=CHCOOH, which has molecular weight 60 (3 carbons, 4 H, 2 O). No, that's 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks in a way that loses part of the chain. For example, the fragment at 45 could be CH2CH2COO-, which is 45? Let me calculate: C3H6O2. 3*12=36, 6=6, 32=32. Total 36+6+32=74. No, that's too high.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think of the molecular formula again. The options are A-D, and the correct answer is among them.

Alternative approach: Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the molecule has a double bond. If it's an ester, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's seven carbons. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. But the formula is C6H12O2. For a six-membered ring with a double bond, the degree of unsaturation would be 2 (one from the ring, one from the double bond). But the formula has only one degree, so that's not possible.

So perhaps the structure is a di-substituted ester? Or maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) without a ring. Wait, no.

Alternatively, if it's a ketone and an ester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But for a six-membered ring (lactone), the formula would be C6H10O2. Wait, because a lactone has the formula CnH2nO2. For n=6, C6H12O2. But that would have a degree of unsaturation of 1 (from the ring). But if there's a double bond as well, the degrees would be 2. So that's conflicting with the formula.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's try another angle.

The fragment at m/z 45. Let me think of possible ions. 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O. Wait, C3H7O is 3*12=36 +7=7 +16=16 → 36+7+16=59. No, that's 59.

Wait, another possibility: 45 corresponds to the molecular weight of CH3COOCH3 (methyl acetate). No, that's 12*3 +6 +16*2=36+6+32=74. No.

Wait, 45 could be the acetate ion (CH3COO^-), which has a molecular weight of 60. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, a fragment of (CH3)2CO (acetone) is molecular weight 58. Not 45.

Wait, let's think of the possible sources of 45. 45 is 45 g/mol. 45 is also the molecular weight of something like C3H3O2. Let me check: 3*12=36, 3*1=3, 2*16=32. 36+3+32=71. No.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2COO- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CHCOO− group. Let's calculate: C3H3O2. 3*12=36, 3=3, 32=32. 36+3+32=71. No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2=CH2 group, which is ethylene, but that's 28. Not 45.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me think of the possible answers.

Another approach: let's think of each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be a diethyl ester, but that's C4H8O2. No, but perhaps a larger ester. Or maybe a cyclohexene ring with an ester or ketone group.

Option C: C6H10O2. For this, a possible structure is a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. But I'm not sure about the NMR.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a methyl propenoate ester. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But this is option C: C6H10O2, which is a larger molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester, but that would have more O's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring, but that would have a different formula.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the double bond is either isolated or conjugated. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond adjacent (alpha,beta), then the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens near 5-6 ppm.

In the IR, the 1700 cm-1 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 could be the conjugated double bond (C=C) stretch, which typically appears around 1650 cm-1.

So if the compound is a beta,gamma-unsaturated carboxylic acid, perhaps, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a CH2CH2COO− group. Wait, but that's not adding up. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH3)COO− group, which is 45? Let's calculate: CH3COO- is 12*2 + 1*3 +16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH3CH2COO− group. That's 3 carbons, molecular weight 74. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a NO group or something else, but that's unlikely.

I'm really stuck on this. Let me try to think of each option's possible structure and see which fits best.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl vinyl something. Let's see: methyl propenoate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is C4H6O2, so not matching. Alternatively, a longer chain ester with a double bond. Maybe CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's C6H10O2, which is option C. Hmm, so option C's formula is C6H10O2, which would fit an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but the IR data would show a strong carbonyl peak at around 1700, which an ester has. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond.

In that case, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's seven carbons. No, perhaps it's CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond in the R group. For example, CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be six carbons. Let me count: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

Wait, that's 2 (from CH2=CHCH2) + 2 (from COOCH2CH3) → 2+2 =4? No, wait, CH2=CHCH2 is three carbons, COOCH2CH3 is four (COO plus two from the ethyl). So that's 3+4=7, but the formula is C6. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's compute the degrees of unsaturation. (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has both a ring and a double bond, that would account for two degrees. Or perhaps two double bonds.

But the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests at least one double bond.

Putting all together:

The IR shows a broad peak (likely -OH), 1700 (carbonyl), and 1650 (possibly another carbonyl or conjugated double bond).

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

The Mass Spec has a peak at 45, which could be a fragment from the molecule.

Looking again at the options, the only option that has two oxygen atoms (allowing for a -OH and a carbonyl group) is option C (C6H10O2) and option A (C6H12O2). But option A has more hydrogens, which might not fit the presence of multiple double bonds.

Wait, let's think about the Mass Spec fragment again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114. A fragment of 45 would imply a loss of 69 (114-45=69). 69 is a possible molecular weight.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is due to a methyl group plus something else. For example, 45 could be CH3CH2COO− (methyl propanoate), but that's 45= (12*3)+(6*1)+(16*2)=36+6+32=74. No, that's too high.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is the acetate group (CH3COO-) which is 60, but that's not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a propenoyl group (CH2=CHCOO-), which would have a molecular weight of 70. No, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. The molecular weight of a ketene (R-C=C=O) would be higher, but perhaps a fragment like (CH3)2C=O (acetone) is 58, but that's not 45.

I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think differently.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid (option C), the fragment at 45 could be the methyl ester of something. Or maybe the molecule breaks to form a methyl group plus another fragment. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the result of losing the carboxylic acid group. For example, if the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, upon losing COOH (which is 46), the remaining would be 114-46=68. But the fragment at 45 isn't 68.

Hmm.

Let me check the possible options again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Suppose the structure is an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOCH3 (C4H6O2). Our option C is C6H10O2, which is a larger molecule. Perhaps the ester is part of a longer chain. Like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. Let's check:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3: The formula is C6H10O2. Yes, because CH2=CHCH2 (C3H5) COO (C2H3O2) CH2CH3 (C2H5), but wait, that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2CH3, which is seven carbons. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester. A six-membered ring with a double bond. For example, a lactone with a double bond. The formula for a lactone is CnH2nO2. For n=5, it's C5H10O2. For n=6, it's C6H12O2. But option C is C6H10O2, which is two hydrogens less. So that would require a double bond as well. But the degrees of unsaturation would be 2 (one from the ring, one from the double bond), which would fit option C's 2 degrees.

So, the structure could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. The IR would show a carbonyl (1700 cm-1), and the 1650 could be the conjugated double bond. The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. The Mass Spec fragment at 45 could be a fragment from the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the Mass Spec part. Let me think about the possible fragments. If the molecule is a cyclic ester with a double bond, perhaps the ring opens to form a fragment. For example, ring opening could produce a smaller fragment. Let's say the ring is five-membered, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester group. For example, the ester group could lose the RCOO part, leaving an OR' group. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the presence of two carbonyl peaks. If it's an ester and a ketone, but that would require three O's, which the formula doesn't have. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 peak is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring's C=C. But without an aromatic ring, that's unlikely.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to eliminate options.

Option D: C6H12O.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So either a ring or a double bond.

If it's a diol, then the IR would have broad peaks, but the carbonyl peak at 1700 wouldn't be present, so option D can't be the answer because the IR has a strong peak at 1700.

Option B: C6H10O.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. Could be a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

But the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. So option B has one O, which could be an -OH. Then, where is the carbonyl group? It would require a carbonyl, which would use the O. But that leaves no O for the -OH. So that can't be. Hence, option B is out.

That leaves options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

If it's an ester with no double bond, how does that fit with the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR? It doesn't. So the structure must have a double bond, which would require two degrees of unsaturation (one from the ring, one from the double bond) but option A only has one. So that's a problem. Hence, option A is less likely.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has a ring and a double bond, that fits. The IR would show a carbonyl (ester or acid) and a conjugated double bond. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens. The Mass Spec fragment at 45 could come from a part of the molecule.

Therefore, option C seems the most plausible.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The possible molecular formulas are **C₆H₁₂O₂**, **C₆H₁₀O**, **C₆H₁₀O₂**, and **C₆H₁₂O**. The analysis of the data is as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, such as a carboxylic acid or ester.
- A **peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C stretch from a double bond.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** (hydrogens attached to a double bond) indicates that the compound contains a double bond.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a fragment like CH₃COOH (46), CH₃COO⁻ (60), or another related group.

### Degrees of Unsaturation:
- The degrees of unsaturation for each formula are calculated as:
  - **C₆H₁₂O₂**: $(2(6) + 2 - 12 - 0)/2 = 1$. This indicates one ring or one double bond.
  - **C₆H₁₀O**: $(2(6) + 2 - 10 - 0)/2 = 2$. This indicates two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.
  - **C₆H₁₀O₂**: $(2(6) + 2 - 10 - 0)/2 = 2$. This also indicates two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.
  - **C₆H₁₂O**: $(2(6) + 2 - 12 - 0)/2 = 1$. This indicates one ring or one double bond.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):**
   - The IR data suggests a carbonyl group, which fits the ester or carboxylic acid functional groups. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR indicates a double bond, which would require two degrees of unsaturation. This option only allows for one degree of unsaturation, making it inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):**
   - This formula has one oxygen atom, which could correspond to an -OH group. However, the IR data shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which requires a second oxygen atom. This makes option B inconsistent with the IR data.

3. **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):**
   - The IR data fits well with a carboxylic acid, as it has a broad -OH peak and a strong carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The ¹H NMR data aligns with the presence of vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond. The degrees of unsaturation (2) allow for one double bond and one ring or two double bonds. The Mass Spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH₃COOH or a related group. This option is consistent with all the data.

4. **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):**
   - This formula has one oxygen atom, which could correspond to an -OH group. However, the IR data shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which requires a second oxygen atom. This makes option D inconsistent with the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the broad -OH peak in the IR spectrum, the strong carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the Mass Spectrometry data.
