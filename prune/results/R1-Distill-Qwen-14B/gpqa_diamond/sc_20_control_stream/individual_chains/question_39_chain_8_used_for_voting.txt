Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I remember that wave functions must satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So that's the normalization condition.

Wait, but the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. But the given wave function is defined only for x where it can exist. Oh, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right. Because if the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3, then in that interval, the given function is non-zero, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that when measuring, particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval.

Wait a minute, the wave function provided is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd because a wave function with a non-zero imaginary part is possible, but also, for the wave function to be zero outside 1 and 3, maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3, which aligns with the measurement results.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The wave function given is for the region where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So for x<1 and x>3, the wave function is zero. So the given expression is valid only between 1 and 3.

But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function. So the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. To find the normalization, I need to integrate the square of the absolute value of the wave function from x=1 to x=3. Because outside that region, the wave function is zero, so the integral is zero there.

So the normalization condition is integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] times [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] dx = 1.

Wait, because when you take the complex conjugate of (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i), you get (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i). So the product becomes (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a^2 / (1+x)) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5i)^2. Wait, but (0.5i)^2 is -0.25, but when you take the product, the cross terms (with i) should cancel out? Wait, no, wait: let me compute it correctly.

Actually, the product is [A - B][A* + B*], where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5i. So A is real, B is imaginary. Then [A - i B/2] [A + i B/2] = A^2 + (B^2)/4 because (i)(-i) is 1. Wait, no: (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + (i B A) - (i B A) - (i B)(i B). So that's A² + (i B A - i B A) which is zero, and then - (i^2 B²) which is + B² since i squared is -1. So overall, (A)^2 + (B)^2.

In this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. So the product is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait no, B is 0.5i, so B squared is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, wait. Let me recast the wave function as ψ(x) = A(x) - i B(x), where A is real and B is real. Then ψ* is A + i B. So |ψ|^2 = (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + B².

Wait, because (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + iAB - iAB - (iB)(iB) = A² - (i^2 B^2) = A² + B^2, because i^2 is -1.

So in this case, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So A = a/sqrt(1+x), B=0.5. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, that's the normalization condition. So I need to compute the integral of [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from x=1 to x=3.

Let me break this integral into two parts: integral of a^2/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so evaluating from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part becomes a² * ln2.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Calculate that: ln2 is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a squared is approximately 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions, which states that the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space must equal 1:

\[
\int |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are not found outside this interval. The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking the integral into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \).  
   Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.

Because outside that region, the wave function is zero, so the integral is zero there.

So the normalization condition is integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] times [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] dx = 1.

Wait, because when you take the complex conjugate of (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i), you get (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i). So the product becomes (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a^2 / (1+x)) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5i)^2. Wait, but (0.5i)^2 is -0.25, but when you take the product, the cross terms (with i) should cancel out? Wait, no, wait: let me compute it correctly.

Actually, the product is [A - B][A* + B*], where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5i. So A is real, B is imaginary. Then [A - i B/2] [A + i B/2] = A^2 + (B^2)/4 because (i)(-i) is 1. Wait, no: (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + (i B A) - (i B A) - (i B)(i B). So that's A² + (i B A - i B A) which is zero, and then - (i^2 B²) which is + B² since i squared is -1. So overall, (A)^2 + (B)^2.

In this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. So the product is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait no, B is 0.5i, so B squared is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, wait. Let me recast the wave function as ψ(x) = A(x) - i B(x), where A is real and B is real. Then ψ* is A + i B. So |ψ|^2 = (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + B².

Wait, because (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + iAB - iAB - (iB)(iB) = A² - (i^2 B^2) = A² + B^2, because i^2 is -1.

So in this case, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So A = a/sqrt(1+x), B=0.5. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, that's the normalization condition. So I need to compute the integral of [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from x=1 to x=3.

Let me break this integral into two parts: integral of a^2/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so evaluating from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part becomes a² * ln2.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Calculate that: ln2 is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a squared is approximately 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions, which states that the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space must equal 1:

\[
\int |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are not found outside this interval. The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking the integral into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \).  
   Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.
