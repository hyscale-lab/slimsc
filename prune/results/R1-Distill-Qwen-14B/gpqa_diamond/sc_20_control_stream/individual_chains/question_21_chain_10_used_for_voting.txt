Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Wait, but the question also brings in tautomerism and optical isomerism. I need to figure out which compounds show these properties.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me handle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a adjacent atom, usually oxygen or nitrogen, leading to different structures. Like in ketones and aldehydes, but more specifically, things like enols and keto forms.

Benzoquinone... I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone could be 1,4-benzoquinone, right? Which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Does that have tautomerism? Well, if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, each ketone group is on the ring. Are the carbonyl groups conjugated? Hmm. Or could they form enol forms? Wait, but quinones are generally stable because of resonance. Wait, but I'm thinking about if it can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't because the structure is already conjugated and stable, so no enol form.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by one carbon. So it's a six-membered ring with three ketones at positions 1,3,5. So each carbonyl is isolated. Wait, can that undergo tautomerism? Well, each carbonyl could potentially form an enol, but wait, if the ring is fully conjugated, the carbonyls are conjugated, making the molecule more stable. Wait, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, tautomerism typically requires a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. If the compound has such hydrogens, it can tautomerize. Benzoquinone, in 1,4 positions, each ketone has alpha hydrogens. So for each ketone, if there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, that's possible. So for example, the benzene ring has carbons with H's attached. So each ketone (C=O) is attached to a carbon that's connected to another carbon with H's. So, structure-wise, each ketone can potentially lose a proton and form an enol. But wait, the structure is a conjugated ring, so maybe the enol form is not possible because the ring is already conjugated. Or maybe it's more about whether the compound can form enol tautomers.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone has no tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are conjugated, making the molecule rigid and not allowing for enol formation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each carbonyl is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, it's 1,3,5 positions, so each is two carbons apart. So each carbonyl is at 1, 3,5. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- in a ring? Wait, no, that's not possible because that would give a 6-membered ring with three carbonyls. So each carbonyl is separated by CH2 groups. Hmm. So each carbonyl has adjacent CH2 groups, which have H's. So those can potentially undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the carbonyl groups are conjugated, maybe the molecule is more stable, so it's less likely to undergo tautomerism. Or perhaps the structure is such that enol forms are possible. Alternatively, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are conjugated enough that tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form would be less stable.

Wait, another angle: compounds that are aromatic might not undergo tautomerism. For example, benzophenone doesn't tautomerize because the carbonyl is part of a conjugated aromatic system. So perhaps benzoquinone, being a quinone (which is a conjugated di-ketone), doesn't tautomerize because the structure is already conjugated and stable.

So, if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show it. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone: each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the benzene ring. Each of those carbons (like the ones next to the ketone) are attached to two other benzene carbons (since benzene is a six-membered ring), so each ketone is at position 1 and 4. So the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone) are each attached to two other carbons in the ring. So, for each ketone, the adjacent carbons (like position 2) have hydrogens attached, right? So, for each ketone, the alpha carbon has H's. So each of those could potentially lose a proton, forming an enol.

But wait, because the ring is conjugated, maybe the enol form is not favored. Because the keto form is more stable in such a conjugated system. So benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each ketone is attached to a CH2 group. So the carbonyl is at C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 another carbonyl, C4 CH2, etc. So each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 has two H's. So each ketone has alpha hydrogens. Therefore, each can potentially tautomerize into an enol. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has three carbonyl groups in a conjugated system (like 1,3,5-trione), would that be conjugated? Let me imagine the structure. The ring has three carbonyls, each separated by a CH2. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 in a ring. Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense because in a six-membered ring, positions 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So each C=O is at 1,3,5, and the others are CH2. So each C=O is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, each of those carbonyls has alpha hydrogens.

So, would the molecule undergo keto-enol tautomerism? If each carbonyl can lose a hydrogen, forming an enol, then yes. But the molecule is cyclic, so maybe the enol form is more strained, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid or because the enol form is less stable. Hmm, I'm not certain here.

Alternatively, I'm confusing tautomerism with resonance. Resonance is when the structure can delocalize electrons, but tautomerism is a specific shift involving H and O.

Wait, another thought: for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group). Both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens. So why would one not show tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't because the ring's conjugation doesn't allow for the enol form. Like, the enol form would have a double bond that disrupts the aromaticity, so it's not favored. So the keto form is more stable, so it doesn't tautomerize.

But I'm not too confident. Let me think about what the actual compounds look like. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. Each O is at opposite positions on the benzene ring. The structure is like two ketones on a benzene ring. So each ketone has adjacent carbons that are part of the ring. So each of those carbons has hydrogens attached.

Wait, but if the benzene ring is fully conjugated, the enol form would require a double bond between two ring carbons. But that would break the aromaticity. So the enol form is not possible because it would lead to a non-aromatic structure. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism because the enol form would not be stable; it would disrupt the aromaticity. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups. So each of these CH2 groups have H's on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls. So each ketone can lose a hydrogen, leading to an enol. Since the ring isn't aromatic, the enol form might be possible without breaking conjugation. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, wait. If the ring is non-aromatic, does that mean the enol form is possible? I think so.

So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. So I need to check if each of these compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-OCH3. Wait, let me write it correctly. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3-C(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, but wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but wait, that's not possible because the hydroxyl would be on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOHâ€”no, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let me look for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one with the OH) would have four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's see:

The molecule is:

R-O-C-O-CH3, where R is CH2CH(OH)CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as:

The structure is (CH3CH(OH)CH2)COOCH3? No, wait:

Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Propanoate is C3H5O2^-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CHOH-COO^-.

Wait, but the ester would have the structure where the ester oxygen is attached to the propionate. So perhaps it's CH3-CHOH-C-O-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the presence of a chiral center. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to the following groups:

- OH group
- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- COOCH3 group (from the carboxylate)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the -OH of the COOH becomes OCH3. So the structure becomes CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the adjacent carbon)
- One COOCH3 group
- One OH group
- And one hydrogen (since it's the second carbon, it's connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other).

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. COOCH3 (from the right)
3. OH
4. H (since it's a CH group)

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH2(OH) group (but wait, no, that's the same carbon)
Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons.

Propanoate is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, no. For propanoate, the chain is three carbons. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

COOCH3 is carbon 1.
Carbon 2 is CH(OH)
Carbon 3 is CH3.

Wait, but wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is CH2. So it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but the central carbon (CH2 with OH) is in the middle. So the groups attached to that carbon are:

- Two CH2 groups (from either side)
- One OH group
- One H

Wait, no. The carbon attached to OH is the second carbon. So it's connected to:

- CH2OH (from carbon 2)
- CH2COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- and two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think about the actual structure. The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (middle CH2) has:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- One OH
- One H.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So the middle carbon is CH2, so it has two H's. Then, the groups on that carbon are: -CH2OH, -CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So four groups: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H.

Wait, but two H's mean that it's not a chiral center. Because the four groups aren't all different. So if the middle carbon has two H's, then it's not a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have a chiral center. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me check the structure again. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The parent chain is three carbons: COOCH3 is on the first carbon, OH on the second. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So the structure is: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, now the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- CH3 (from carbon 3)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH
- H

So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism.

Wait, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So it can show optical isomerism.

Now, what about dimethyl fumarate?

Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH with two ester groups on either end. So dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH â†’ wait, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2(CH2OOC-OCH3)=CH(CH2OOC-OCH3)?

Wait, perhaps better to write it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that would be the structure of maleic anhydride, but for fumarate, it's trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Let me think: The structure is CH2=CH with two ester groups. So it's O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So each end is a COOH group, but in the ester, each becomes COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the structure correctly. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester: (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a CH=CH group.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but no, it's two ester groups on either end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(OOCCH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

No, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So it's:

CH2=CH with the two central carbons each attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me correct that.

Fumarate is the trans form of butenedioic acid. So the structure has a double bond between C2 and C3, with the two COOH groups on C1 and C4, but in the trans configuration.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3 attached to C1 and C4, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and the groups on either side of the double bond (C2 and C3) are on opposite sides (trans configuration).

So, the structure is:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, that doesn't have the double bond. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize it correctly.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the diester would be:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

So the double bond is between the two CH groups, each connected to a COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each of the two central CH groups is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH
|
CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

But that's not possible because each CH would have to have two substituents. Alternatively, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, and the double bond is between them. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, this is getting too confusing. Let me approach this from another angle. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. The di-ester would be (E)-butenedioate diester. Now, let's look for any chiral centers.

In the structure, each of the central carbons (the ones with the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group (from the other side). Wait, but since the double bond is between the two middle carbons, each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H (since the structure is CH2-CH2 with COOCH3 on each end). Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Each of the two central carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, but with a double bond between them. So each has a double bond, a COOCH3, and two H's. So the structure would be:

H
|
C=CH
|
H
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group attached. No, that would be a different structure.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So, does it have a plane of symmetry? Yes. Because in the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetric. So, each side mirrors the other. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't have any chiral centers. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: For (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

With a double bond in the middle? So it's CH2=CH with each CH2 attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

No, that's more like succinic acid's di-ester, which would be a single bond. So, for fumarate, it's a double bond.

So, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, CH2-CH2 becomes CH2=CH.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but no, that would have the two COOCH3 groups on either end of a double bond.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the molecule as:

(CH3O)OC-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 â†’ that's succinate, with a single bond.

But fumarate has a double bond.

So, the structure is:

(CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=
|
CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3
|

No, that can't be right. So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=
|
CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to see that in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of a double bond.

In any case, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. In the E configuration (fumarate), the two substituents (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond, which gives the molecule a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral because it's symmetrical. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a double bond and is symmetric, it's not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is (E), so it's symmetric. So, no chiral center.

Therefore, for part B, which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon) and therefore shows optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Dimethyl fumarate has E/Z isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism; that's stereoisomerism due to double bonds, which is a different type. The question is about optical isomerism, which requires a chiral center.

So, putting it all together:

A) For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

B) For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism. So part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the compounds are:

A) Benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize)
B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism)

Looking at the options:

Option B is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, according to my analysis, A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom between two adjacent atoms, resulting in different structural isomers (e.g., keto-enol tautomerism). 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, making it highly unstable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.
   
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring, each separated by a CHâ‚‚ group. Each ketone has alpha hydrogens, and the enol form would not disrupt the aromaticity since the ring is not aromatic. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-CHOH-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to:
   - CHâ‚ƒ (methyl group),
   - COOCHâ‚ƒ (ester group),
   - H (hydrogen),
   - and another CHâ‚‚ group.
   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (CHâ‚ƒO)â‚‚C=CHC(=O)OCHâ‚ƒ. The molecule has a double bond in the trans (E) configuration. While it exhibits geometric isomerism due to the double bond, it does not have a chiral center. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Wait, but the question also brings in tautomerism and optical isomerism. I need to figure out which compounds show these properties.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me handle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a adjacent atom, usually oxygen or nitrogen, leading to different structures. Like in ketones and aldehydes, but more specifically, things like enols and keto forms.

Benzoquinone... I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone could be 1,4-benzoquinone, right? Which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Does that have tautomerism? Well, if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, each ketone group is on the ring. Are the carbonyl groups conjugated? Hmm. Or could they form enol forms? Wait, but quinones are generally stable because of resonance. Wait, but I'm thinking about if it can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't because the structure is already conjugated and stable, so no enol form.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by one carbon. So it's a six-membered ring with three ketones at positions 1,3,5. So each carbonyl is isolated. Wait, can that undergo tautomerism? Well, each carbonyl could potentially form an enol, but wait, if the ring is fully conjugated, the carbonyls are conjugated, making the molecule more stable. Wait, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, tautomerism typically requires a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. If the compound has such hydrogens, it can tautomerize. Benzoquinone, in 1,4 positions, each ketone has alpha hydrogens. So for each ketone, if there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, that's possible. So for example, the benzene ring has carbons with H's attached. So each ketone (C=O) is attached to a carbon that's connected to another carbon with H's. So, structure-wise, each ketone can potentially lose a proton and form an enol. But wait, the structure is a conjugated ring, so maybe the enol form is not possible because the ring is already conjugated. Or maybe it's more about whether the compound can form enol tautomers.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone has no tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are conjugated, making the molecule rigid and not allowing for enol formation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each carbonyl is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, it's 1,3,5 positions, so each is two carbons apart. So each carbonyl is at 1, 3,5. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- in a ring? Wait, no, that's not possible because that would give a 6-membered ring with three carbonyls. So each carbonyl is separated by CH2 groups. Hmm. So each carbonyl has adjacent CH2 groups, which have H's. So those can potentially undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the carbonyl groups are conjugated, maybe the molecule is more stable, so it's less likely to undergo tautomerism. Or perhaps the structure is such that enol forms are possible. Alternatively, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are conjugated enough that tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form would be less stable.

Wait, another angle: compounds that are aromatic might not undergo tautomerism. For example, benzophenone doesn't tautomerize because the carbonyl is part of a conjugated aromatic system. So perhaps benzoquinone, being a quinone (which is a conjugated di-ketone), doesn't tautomerize because the structure is already conjugated and stable.

So, if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show it. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether each carbonyl has alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone: each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the benzene ring. Each of those carbons (like the ones next to the ketone) are attached to two other benzene carbons (since benzene is a six-membered ring), so each ketone is at position 1 and 4. So the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone) are each attached to two other carbons in the ring. So, for each ketone, the adjacent carbons (like position 2) have hydrogens attached, right? So, for each ketone, the alpha carbon has H's. So each of those could potentially lose a proton, forming an enol.

But wait, because the ring is conjugated, maybe the enol form is not favored. Because the keto form is more stable in such a conjugated system. So benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each ketone is attached to a CH2 group. So the carbonyl is at C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 another carbonyl, C4 CH2, etc. So each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 has two H's. So each ketone has alpha hydrogens. Therefore, each can potentially tautomerize into an enol. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has three carbonyl groups in a conjugated system (like 1,3,5-trione), would that be conjugated? Let me imagine the structure. The ring has three carbonyls, each separated by a CH2. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 in a ring. Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense because in a six-membered ring, positions 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So each C=O is at 1,3,5, and the others are CH2. So each C=O is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, each of those carbonyls has alpha hydrogens.

So, would the molecule undergo keto-enol tautomerism? If each carbonyl can lose a hydrogen, forming an enol, then yes. But the molecule is cyclic, so maybe the enol form is more strained, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid or because the enol form is less stable. Hmm, I'm not certain here.

Alternatively, I'm confusing tautomerism with resonance. Resonance is when the structure can delocalize electrons, but tautomerism is a specific shift involving H and O.

Wait, another thought: for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group). Both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens. So why would one not show tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't because the ring's conjugation doesn't allow for the enol form. Like, the enol form would have a double bond that disrupts the aromaticity, so it's not favored. So the keto form is more stable, so it doesn't tautomerize.

But I'm not too confident. Let me think about what the actual compounds look like. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. Each O is at opposite positions on the benzene ring. The structure is like two ketones on a benzene ring. So each ketone has adjacent carbons that are part of the ring. So each of those carbons has hydrogens attached.

Wait, but if the benzene ring is fully conjugated, the enol form would require a double bond between two ring carbons. But that would break the aromaticity. So the enol form is not possible because it would lead to a non-aromatic structure. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism because the enol form would not be stable; it would disrupt the aromaticity. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups. So each of these CH2 groups have H's on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls. So each ketone can lose a hydrogen, leading to an enol. Since the ring isn't aromatic, the enol form might be possible without breaking conjugation. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, wait. If the ring is non-aromatic, does that mean the enol form is possible? I think so.

So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. So I need to check if each of these compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-OCH3. Wait, let me write it correctly. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3-C(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, but wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but wait, that's not possible because the hydroxyl would be on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOHâ€”no, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let me look for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one with the OH) would have four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's see:

The molecule is:

R-O-C-O-CH3, where R is CH2CH(OH)CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as:

The structure is (CH3CH(OH)CH2)COOCH3? No, wait:

Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Propanoate is C3H5O2^-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CHOH-COO^-.

Wait, but the ester would have the structure where the ester oxygen is attached to the propionate. So perhaps it's CH3-CHOH-C-O-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the presence of a chiral center. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to the following groups:

- OH group
- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- COOCH3 group (from the carboxylate)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the -OH of the COOH becomes OCH3. So the structure becomes CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the adjacent carbon)
- One COOCH3 group
- One OH group
- And one hydrogen (since it's the second carbon, it's connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other).

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. COOCH3 (from the right)
3. OH
4. H (since it's a CH group)

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH2(OH) group (but wait, no, that's the same carbon)
Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons.

Propanoate is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, no. For propanoate, the chain is three carbons. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

COOCH3 is carbon 1.
Carbon 2 is CH(OH)
Carbon 3 is CH3.

Wait, but wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is CH2. So it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but the central carbon (CH2 with OH) is in the middle. So the groups attached to that carbon are:

- Two CH2 groups (from either side)
- One OH group
- One H

Wait, no. The carbon attached to OH is the second carbon. So it's connected to:

- CH2OH (from carbon 2)
- CH2COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- and two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think about the actual structure. The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (middle CH2) has:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- One OH
- One H.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So the middle carbon is CH2, so it has two H's. Then, the groups on that carbon are: -CH2OH, -CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So four groups: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H.

Wait, but two H's mean that it's not a chiral center. Because the four groups aren't all different. So if the middle carbon has two H's, then it's not a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have a chiral center. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me check the structure again. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The parent chain is three carbons: COOCH3 is on the first carbon, OH on the second. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So the structure is: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, now the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- CH3 (from carbon 3)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH
- H

So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism.

Wait, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So it can show optical isomerism.

Now, what about dimethyl fumarate?

Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH with two ester groups on either end. So dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH â†’ wait, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2(CH2OOC-OCH3)=CH(CH2OOC-OCH3)?

Wait, perhaps better to write it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that would be the structure of maleic anhydride, but for fumarate, it's trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Let me think: The structure is CH2=CH with two ester groups. So it's O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So each end is a COOH group, but in the ester, each becomes COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the structure correctly. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester: (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a CH=CH group.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but no, it's two ester groups on either end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(OOCCH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

No, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So it's:

CH2=CH with the two central carbons each attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me correct that.

Fumarate is the trans form of butenedioic acid. So the structure has a double bond between C2 and C3, with the two COOH groups on C1 and C4, but in the trans configuration.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3 attached to C1 and C4, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and the groups on either side of the double bond (C2 and C3) are on opposite sides (trans configuration).

So, the structure is:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, that doesn't have the double bond. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize it correctly.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the diester would be:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

So the double bond is between the two CH groups, each connected to a COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each of the two central CH groups is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH
|
CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

But that's not possible because each CH would have to have two substituents. Alternatively, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, and the double bond is between them. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, this is getting too confusing. Let me approach this from another angle. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. The di-ester would be (E)-butenedioate diester. Now, let's look for any chiral centers.

In the structure, each of the central carbons (the ones with the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group (from the other side). Wait, but since the double bond is between the two middle carbons, each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H (since the structure is CH2-CH2 with COOCH3 on each end). Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Each of the two central carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, but with a double bond between them. So each has a double bond, a COOCH3, and two H's. So the structure would be:

H
|
C=CH
|
H
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group attached. No, that would be a different structure.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So, does it have a plane of symmetry? Yes. Because in the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetric. So, each side mirrors the other. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't have any chiral centers. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: For (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

With a double bond in the middle? So it's CH2=CH with each CH2 attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

No, that's more like succinic acid's di-ester, which would be a single bond. So, for fumarate, it's a double bond.

So, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, CH2-CH2 becomes CH2=CH.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but no, that would have the two COOCH3 groups on either end of a double bond.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the molecule as:

(CH3O)OC-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 â†’ that's succinate, with a single bond.

But fumarate has a double bond.

So, the structure is:

(CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=
|
CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3
|

No, that can't be right. So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=
|
CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to see that in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of a double bond.

In any case, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. In the E configuration (fumarate), the two substituents (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond, which gives the molecule a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral because it's symmetrical. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a double bond and is symmetric, it's not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is (E), so it's symmetric. So, no chiral center.

Therefore, for part B, which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon) and therefore shows optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Dimethyl fumarate has E/Z isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism; that's stereoisomerism due to double bonds, which is a different type. The question is about optical isomerism, which requires a chiral center.

So, putting it all together:

A) For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

B) For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism. So part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the compounds are:

A) Benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize)
B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism)

Looking at the options:

Option B is A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, according to my analysis, A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom between two adjacent atoms, resulting in different structural isomers (e.g., keto-enol tautomerism). 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, making it highly unstable. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.
   
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring, each separated by a CHâ‚‚ group. Each ketone has alpha hydrogens, and the enol form would not disrupt the aromaticity since the ring is not aromatic. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-CHOH-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to:
   - CHâ‚ƒ (methyl group),
   - COOCHâ‚ƒ (ester group),
   - H (hydrogen),
   - and another CHâ‚‚ group.
   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (CHâ‚ƒO)â‚‚C=CHC(=O)OCHâ‚ƒ. The molecule has a double bond in the trans (E) configuration. While it exhibits geometric isomerism due to the double bond, it does not have a chiral center. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
