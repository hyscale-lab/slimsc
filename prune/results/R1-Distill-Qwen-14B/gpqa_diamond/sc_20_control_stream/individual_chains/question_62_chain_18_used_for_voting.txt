Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, the target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Let's see, "1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde." So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The aldehyde group is on the cyclohexane ring. Then, on the first carbon (the same as the aldehyde?), there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached. Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be a bit different. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups are on a methyl that's attached to the cyclohexane ring, which also has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw this mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group connected to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So, that substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. And the same carbon where this substituent is attached also has an aldehyde group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH group that has an aldehyde (CHO), a hydroxyl (OH), and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a CH group with three groups: OH, cyclohexane, and CHO.

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group (CH2), but one hydrogen is replaced by the cyclohexane ring, and another by the hydroxyl group. So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). And this is attached to another cyclohexane ring, which has an aldehyde group on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a side chain. The side chain is a CH group with substituents: OH, cyclohexyl, and a carbonyl group (the aldehyde). Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane (let's say position 1) has a CH2 group attached, but that CH2 has a hydroxyl, cyclohexyl, and then a carbonyl (CHO)? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is also attached to a hydroxyl and the aldehyde. So, from the main cyclohexane, there is a CH2 group. That CH2 has an OH group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), and the same carbon as the CH2 is also attached to the aldehyde group. Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group at position 1. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent, which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane (position 1), and that methyl has two substituents: a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the methyl group (-CH2-) is attached to the cyclohexane (position 1). And this methyl has a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl substituent. So, the group is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) with a substituent at position 1, which is a CH group connected to OH, cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde.

Wait, but the aldehyde is part of the main ring. So, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (CHO) at position 1. Then, the same carbon (position 1) has a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the main ring is cyclohexane, and attached to one of its carbons is a group that's a methyl group (CH2-) but with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl on the same carbon as the methyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a methyl group which in turn is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same methyl is attached to an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that same carbon also has an aldehyde group. Wait, but that can't be because the same carbon can't have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me write the structure:

The molecule is:

Cyclohexane ring (let's say carbon 1) connected to a CH2 group. The CH2 has three substituents: a hydroxyl group (OH), a cyclohexyl group (so another cyclohexane ring attached), and a formyl group (CHO). Wait, but that would make the CH2 have four substituents, which is impossible. Hmm, perhaps it's a CH group, not CH2. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and that CH is attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, but that would make the structure: the main cyclohexane has a substituent which is a CH group with OH, cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that doesn't make sense because that would be a four-bond carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group, but with the aldehyde attached at the same carbon as the CH2. So, the group is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. But that also can't be because the same carbon can't have five bonds.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the nomenclature. Let me instead think about the reaction steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to another carbon). So, structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Now, what reagents would I use to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule?

Looking at the options, each option has a sequence of reagents. Let's think about possible reactions.

Option C, for example, has steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, what do these steps do?

First, NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's a typical alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation. Methyl chloride would be an alkylating agent. Wait, but where?

Alternatively, maybe it's for a Grignard-like reaction, but without the Mg, perhaps it's for alkylation of a benzene ring. Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the first step is a deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate the alkyne. Ethynylcyclohexane has two acidic protons on the triple bond. The alkyne protons are more acidic than alkenes, but less than phenols. So, NaNH2 in ammonia would deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. But wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl; the cyclohexenide would attack as a nucleophile. So, perhaps the alkyne is being converted to a longer chain.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a structure of cyclohexane-C≡CH. When treated with NaNH2, it would deprotonate to cyclohexane-C≡C⁻ Na+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react as an electrophile. The alkyne ion would attack the methyl chloride, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's just adding a methyl to the alkyne. So, the product would be pentynylcyclohexane? Wait, no, because the alkyne is at the end. So, after alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Hmm, but that's a longer alkyne.

Wait, but another possibility is that after deprotonation, the alkyne could undergo some alkylation, but perhaps it's more likely that the alkyne is being converted to a different functional group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being functionalized into an alkyne with a substituent.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group and an alcohol group, and a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a ketone or an aldehyde. Let's consider the possible reactions.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane can be hydrogenated. For example, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H2 across the triple bond, converting it to a single bond. So, cyclohexane-C-C (but that would just be cyclohexane with a single CH2 group, which doesn't help. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar would give cis-alkene. But if using H2 and Pd, it would give trans-alkene? Or maybe it's a full hydrogenation to a single bond.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation to form the aldehyde. Oxidation of a primary alcohol to aldehyde, or maybe oxidation of a ketone? Alternatively, oxidation of a secondary alcohol to ketone, but that's not aldehyde.

Wait, but let's think about the starting material. If I have an alkyne, perhaps I can do some kind of hydration. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone. But wait, that would require the alkyne to be internal. Ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so hydration under acidic conditions (like HgSO4 and H2SO4) would give a ketone. Because for terminal alkynes, HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would form a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, so adding water would give R-C(OH)-CH3, which would lose a proton and form R-C(O)-CH3, a ketone. So, cyclohexylacetylene (ethynylcyclohexane) would become cyclohexaneacetophenone? Or wait, no, it would become cyclohexane with a ketone group. So, cyclohexyl group attached to a carbonyl group. So, cyclohexanone derivative.

Wait, but the target molecule has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to form the aldehyde.

Another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some method. For example, converting the alkyne into a primary alcohol and then oxidizing it.

Wait, but how would you get an aldehyde from an alkyne? One way is via theStephen reduction: alkyne to aldehyde via catalytic hydrogenation. Or, perhaps via hydroboration followed by oxidation.

Wait, wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then perhaps that's epoxidated or something else. But I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, but that's more likely for alkynes via oxymercuration or other methods.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. But how? Typically, alkynes can be converted to Grignard reagents via deprotonation, but I'm not sure.

Let's think about the options again. Let's look at each option and see what they do.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

So, step 1: NaNH2 and MeCl. As before, maybe alkylation of the alkyne. Then, H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. For ethynylcyclohexane, hydrogenation would make cyclohexane-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, the triple bond would become a single bond, so it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH3? No, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH, so after hydrogenation, it would become R-CH2-CH3, which is ethylcyclohexane. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Wait, but after hydrogenation, we have ethylcyclohexane. Ba(OH)2 is used for the Birch reduction or for elimination reactions, but I'm not sure. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration conditions for a triple bond? Wait, but the triple bond was already hydrogenated. Maybe that's not the correct path.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne, then ethyl chloride would alkylate, making R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination. Wait, but with what? Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonating something else. Step 3: O3 followed by H2O, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4: NH4OH, which might be for workup or amine.

But the starting material after step 1 is a longer alkyne. Ozonolysis of an alkyne? I'm a bit confused. Wait, ozonolysis is usually for alkenes. So, perhaps step 2 is for hydrogenation? No, because step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene via deprotonation and alkylation, then maybe a different step. Hmm, not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So, step 1: alkyne to R-C≡C-Me. Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3 would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. R-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, but that seems not useful. Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S as workup. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated first to an alkene, but wait, step 2 is H2 over Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So, step 3, ozone would do nothing because there's no double bond. Unless in step 2, the alkyne was partially hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. Wait, but H2/Pd-CaCO3 is for full hydrogenation. So, perhaps that's not correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol as the methyl source. Wait, methanol as an electrophile? Hmm, perhaps it's more about deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate the alkyne. Then, methanol would donate a methyl group? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form the cyclohexenide, which then reacts with methanol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step in each option is for alkyne alkylation. Let me think about what each first step does.

Option A: Alkyne treated with NaNH2 and MeCl → R-C≡C-Me.

Option B: R-C≡C- Et.

Option C: R-C≡C-Me.

Option D: R-C≡C-O-Me? Or maybe not, since MeOH is used as the electrophile. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the first step is for alkynide formation. So, the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2 in ammonia to form a cyclohexenide ion, which then reacts with an alkyl halide (like methyl chloride) in a substitution. So, R-C≡C⁻ + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3. So, the alkyne becomes a longer alkyne, now R-C≡C-CH3.

Then, what's next? Let's say we have R-C≡C-CH3. Next step in option A is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane. R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a propane chain attached to cyclohexane. Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination, but from where? Maybe Ba(OH)2 is for the Birch reduction, but Birch is for arenes. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in elimination reactions, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene. Let me think. If the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation with H2 and Lindlar catalyst would give cis-alkene, R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making a single bond. So, R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a longer alkane chain. Doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized into an aldehyde or ketone. Let me think about oxidation. HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O is for the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. So, if I have R-C≡CH, treatment with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would form R-C(O)-CH3, a ketone. But in option A, the last step is that. So, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So, that would convert any triple bonds to ketones. But if the triple bond was already hydrogenated, as in step 2, then step 4 wouldn't do anything.

Wait, but in option A, step 1 is alkylation of the alkyne, making R-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is for elimination. But the molecule now is R-CH2-CH2-Me. How would elimination work? Maybe forming a cyclohexene ring? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for the oxidation of an alcohol to ketone, but I don't see where the alcohol comes from yet.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group and an alcohol group. So, perhaps one step involves oxidation to aldehyde and another involves introducing the hydroxyl group.

Another approach: let's consider the target molecule's structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent at position 1 which is a CH group with OH, cyclohexyl, and maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH group which has an OH and an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol or something similar. Then, functionalized. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which can then be oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a substituent, then hydrogenated to a diol, then oxidized.

Wait, maybe the steps involve converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group via some method.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and MeCl (alkylation), H2/Pd (hydrogenation), O3/(CH3)2S (ozonolysis), Ba(OH)2.

So, after alkylation, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me. Hydrogenation (step 2) turns this into R-CH2-CH2-Me. Ozonolysis (step 3) would require a double bond, but the molecule after step 2 is a single bond. So, perhaps this step is incorrect.

Wait, unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the alkyne. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation to form a cis or trans alkene. But I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in step 2 to form an alkene, but I'm not sure which catalyst does that. Lindlar's catalyst is for cis hydrogenation, and using a poisoned catalyst could stop at the alkene. So maybe step 2 is a partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd is a catalyst for full hydrogenation, so it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, O3 would have nothing to react with, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that's probably not the right path.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and MeOH, then Li in liq NH3, then O3/(CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH. The alkyne is deprotonated to form cyclohexenide, which then reacts with MeOH. But MeOH is a weak electrophile. Maybe the cyclohexenide would attack MeOH, leading to R-C≡C-O-Me. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. Step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne? Not sure. Usually, ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So unless the alkyne is converted to a diene, this might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond, then ozonolysis.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexyl-methyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne to make it R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, but that doesn't help much.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched to form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, considering the hydration of the alkyne to a ketone. So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 is to hydrate it to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? No, earlier I thought that hydration would give a ketone, but maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like propyne) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O gives a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane with a ketone group, perhaps cyclohexanone. But that's a ketone, not an aldehyde. Hmm.

But the target molecule has an aldehyde. So perhaps the ketone is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But oxidation of a secondary alcohol doesn't give an aldehyde; it would require a primary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a primary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

How to get a primary alcohol from an alkyne? Oxymercuration would give a primary alcohol. But that requires a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then treated with something to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then undergoes some oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl chloride, then subjected to some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched with a carbonyl compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, maybe one of the steps is introducing the hydroxyl group via oxidation or via another method.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form a longer chain, then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, if I have R-C≡C-CH3 (after alkylation), then partial hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-CH3, then perhaps ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. But if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the alkyne in step 1 is R-C≡C-CH3. If step 2 is hydrogenation with a catalyst that stops at the alkene, like Lindlar's, then it would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3 as a cis alkene. No, wait, if the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. Ozonolysis can’t cleave that. So that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for a way to form a diol, which can then be oxidized to form a carbonyl. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to form R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's an alkane).

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized.

Wait, but how would you get a propargyl alcohol from the alkyne? Maybe via hydration with a different reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again. But that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to form a cyclohexanol derivative, then oxidize it to cyclohexanone, but I don't see how that leads to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the target molecule is formed via a coupling reaction, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation, the second is hydrogenation to form an alkene, the third is ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and the fourth step is to introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, let me think about option C again:

1. NaNH2 and MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, a straight chain.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination, but I'm not sure.

So, that doesn't seem to work.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

3. O3, H2O → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

4. NH4OH → not sure.

Hmm.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, MeOH → perhaps R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/NH3 → strong base, maybe elimination.

3. O3 → reacts with double bond to form ozonides.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, R is R-C≡C-OCH3.

Then, step 2, Li/NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating and eliminating to form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation and forming a carbanion, which could attack something else. Not sure.

Then step 3, O3 would need a double bond. So, perhaps the molecule after step 2 has a double bond. So, if step 2 produces a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how that would lead to the target molecule.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

- Partial hydrogenation to form R-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that's just a longer chain).

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol and then treated with a strong base to form an enolate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that is a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Perhaps the substituent comes from the alkyne. So, the alkyne is functionalized to add a methyl group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl substituent.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

For example, ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to R-C≡C-CH3 → convert triple bond to ketone (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) → R-C(O)-CH3. Then, perhaps reduce the ketone to an alcohol, then oxidize to aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

But looking at the options, the only option with HgSO4 and H2SO4 is option A, step 4. So, perhaps that's the hydration step.

Wait, let's see option A:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → ?

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which is the hydration step, but after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. So, step 4 would have nothing to react with. So, that can't be right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → no reaction, as no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond, but that's not helpful.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, MeOH → R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

3. O3 → needs a double bond, but not present.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene. So, R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? Not sure.

3. O3, H2O → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Wait, but then what would that give? For example, if step 3 cleaves the double bond, we could get two carbonyl groups. But how would that form the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via step 2, which is then ozonolysed into two carbonyl groups.

Then, the workup in step 4 would produce aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2, Li/NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation and elimination. But the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Elimination would require a β-hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in step 2 to a cis or trans alkene. So, step 2 would be hydrogenation with a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's) to form an alkene.

Then, step 3, ozonolysis, would cleave the alkene into two carbonyls.

Wait, let's imagine that. After step 2, we have R-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? No, wait, no. The starting alkyne after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So, hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, which is a single bond. Ozonolysis won't act on single bonds.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me try to map it out.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → No reaction, as no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is used in elimination reactions, such as the formation of alkenes from alcohols. But where would the alcohol come from?

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is for the oxidation of a diol to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a CH group with OH and cyclohexyl.

Perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form a longer chain, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde, and introducing the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which also has an OH and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the methyl group is being formed from the alkyne, and the OH is introduced via oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then reacted to form a cyclohexane ring.

But I'm not seeing that in the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents in each option.

Option C step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, sometimes used in the Birch reduction (but that's for aromatic rings), or for elimination reactions, like dehydrogenation. Alternatively, it's used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones.

Wait, perhaps step 4 in option C is for oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone. If step 3 in option C is ozonolysis, which would generate carbonyl groups, and step 4 is Ba(OH)2, maybe for further oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis doesn't do anything.

4. Ba(OH)2 for elimination, forming a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction. Let me think about the Ba(OH)2 step. Ba(OH)2 is also used in the oxidation of alcohols under certain conditions. For example, an alcohol with adjacent R groups can be oxidized to a ketone using Ba(OH)2. But the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl group. So, perhaps the alcohol is a primary alcohol, then oxidation would give an aldehyde.

Hmm, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis doesn't do anything.

4. Ba(OH)2 for oxidation of an alcohol to aldehyde. But where would the alcohol come from?

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C.

Wait, looking back at the target molecule, perhaps the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which also has an aldehyde. So, maybe the alkyne is converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then treated with a base to form an enolate, which can then be quenched to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched with HCHO (formaldehyde) to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how that ties into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing how the options fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not confident. Let me try to think through each option's possible products.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → No reaction, since no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination to form a double bond, but I don't see the necessary groups.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for oxidation. If, after step 2, there's an alcohol present, Ba(OH)2 could oxidize it. But where does the alcohol come from?

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. So, if step 3 somehow introduced a primary alcohol, step 4 would oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the primary alcohol in the steps.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

Looking back, the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, the synthesis must involve steps to introduce both groups. 

Option C has steps that might involve adding methyl, hydrogenating, ozonolysis (which doesn't do anything here), and Ba(OH)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C because it involves ozonolysis, which would create carbonyl groups. But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't work. So, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl. So, perhaps one of the steps is adding the cyclohexyl group via alkylation.

So, ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3 → hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → ozonolysis (but no double bond, so nothing) → Ba(OH)2 → ?

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again. But I'm not seeing how that forms the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then treated with a strong base to form an enolate, which then undergoes alkylation.

But again, I'm not seeing it.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option C as the correct answer. Because it's the only option that combines alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and Ba(OH)2, which might be used for oxidation or elimination.

The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent at the same position, which is a CH group attached to a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and the aldehyde. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: The alkyne is fully hydrogenated to R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but the molecule lacks functional groups that would react with Ba(OH)₂ at this stage.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: These reagents are used for hydrating alkynes to ketones, but the alkyne was already hydrogenated in step 2, so this step would not contribute.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not align with the target molecule, as the aldehyde group and hydroxyl group are not introduced.

---

#### **Option B:**
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the molecule lacks β-hydrogens to form a double bond.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely for workup, but the earlier steps do not set up the necessary intermediates for the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, as the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups are not introduced.

---

#### **Option C:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: The alkyne is fully hydrogenated to R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2, so this step does not contribute.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but the molecule lacks functional groups that would react with Ba(OH)₂ at this stage.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not align with the target molecule, as the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups are not introduced.

---

#### **Option D:**
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-OCH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the molecule lacks β-hydrogens to form a double bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely for workup, but the earlier steps do not set up the necessary intermediates for the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, as the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups are not introduced.

---

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the uncertainties in the steps.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, the target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Let's see, "1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde." So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The aldehyde group is on the cyclohexane ring. Then, on the first carbon (the same as the aldehyde?), there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached. Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be a bit different. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups are on a methyl that's attached to the cyclohexane ring, which also has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw this mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group connected to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So, that substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. And the same carbon where this substituent is attached also has an aldehyde group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH group that has an aldehyde (CHO), a hydroxyl (OH), and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a CH group with three groups: OH, cyclohexane, and CHO.

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group (CH2), but one hydrogen is replaced by the cyclohexane ring, and another by the hydroxyl group. So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). And this is attached to another cyclohexane ring, which has an aldehyde group on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a side chain. The side chain is a CH group with substituents: OH, cyclohexyl, and a carbonyl group (the aldehyde). Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane (let's say position 1) has a CH2 group attached, but that CH2 has a hydroxyl, cyclohexyl, and then a carbonyl (CHO)? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is also attached to a hydroxyl and the aldehyde. So, from the main cyclohexane, there is a CH2 group. That CH2 has an OH group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), and the same carbon as the CH2 is also attached to the aldehyde group. Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group at position 1. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent, which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane (position 1), and that methyl has two substituents: a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the methyl group (-CH2-) is attached to the cyclohexane (position 1). And this methyl has a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl substituent. So, the group is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) with a substituent at position 1, which is a CH group connected to OH, cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde.

Wait, but the aldehyde is part of the main ring. So, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (CHO) at position 1. Then, the same carbon (position 1) has a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the main ring is cyclohexane, and attached to one of its carbons is a group that's a methyl group (CH2-) but with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl on the same carbon as the methyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a methyl group which in turn is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same methyl is attached to an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that same carbon also has an aldehyde group. Wait, but that can't be because the same carbon can't have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me write the structure:

The molecule is:

Cyclohexane ring (let's say carbon 1) connected to a CH2 group. The CH2 has three substituents: a hydroxyl group (OH), a cyclohexyl group (so another cyclohexane ring attached), and a formyl group (CHO). Wait, but that would make the CH2 have four substituents, which is impossible. Hmm, perhaps it's a CH group, not CH2. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and that CH is attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, but that would make the structure: the main cyclohexane has a substituent which is a CH group with OH, cyclohexyl, and the aldehyde group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that doesn't make sense because that would be a four-bond carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group, but with the aldehyde attached at the same carbon as the CH2. So, the group is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. But that also can't be because the same carbon can't have five bonds.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the nomenclature. Let me instead think about the reaction steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to another carbon). So, structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Now, what reagents would I use to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule?

Looking at the options, each option has a sequence of reagents. Let's think about possible reactions.

Option C, for example, has steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, what do these steps do?

First, NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's a typical alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation. Methyl chloride would be an alkylating agent. Wait, but where?

Alternatively, maybe it's for a Grignard-like reaction, but without the Mg, perhaps it's for alkylation of a benzene ring. Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the first step is a deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate the alkyne. Ethynylcyclohexane has two acidic protons on the triple bond. The alkyne protons are more acidic than alkenes, but less than phenols. So, NaNH2 in ammonia would deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. But wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl; the cyclohexenide would attack as a nucleophile. So, perhaps the alkyne is being converted to a longer chain.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a structure of cyclohexane-C≡CH. When treated with NaNH2, it would deprotonate to cyclohexane-C≡C⁻ Na+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react as an electrophile. The alkyne ion would attack the methyl chloride, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's just adding a methyl to the alkyne. So, the product would be pentynylcyclohexane? Wait, no, because the alkyne is at the end. So, after alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Hmm, but that's a longer alkyne.

Wait, but another possibility is that after deprotonation, the alkyne could undergo some alkylation, but perhaps it's more likely that the alkyne is being converted to a different functional group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being functionalized into an alkyne with a substituent.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group and an alcohol group, and a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a ketone or an aldehyde. Let's consider the possible reactions.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane can be hydrogenated. For example, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H2 across the triple bond, converting it to a single bond. So, cyclohexane-C-C (but that would just be cyclohexane with a single CH2 group, which doesn't help. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar would give cis-alkene. But if using H2 and Pd, it would give trans-alkene? Or maybe it's a full hydrogenation to a single bond.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation to form the aldehyde. Oxidation of a primary alcohol to aldehyde, or maybe oxidation of a ketone? Alternatively, oxidation of a secondary alcohol to ketone, but that's not aldehyde.

Wait, but let's think about the starting material. If I have an alkyne, perhaps I can do some kind of hydration. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone. But wait, that would require the alkyne to be internal. Ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so hydration under acidic conditions (like HgSO4 and H2SO4) would give a ketone. Because for terminal alkynes, HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would form a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, so adding water would give R-C(OH)-CH3, which would lose a proton and form R-C(O)-CH3, a ketone. So, cyclohexylacetylene (ethynylcyclohexane) would become cyclohexaneacetophenone? Or wait, no, it would become cyclohexane with a ketone group. So, cyclohexyl group attached to a carbonyl group. So, cyclohexanone derivative.

Wait, but the target molecule has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to form the aldehyde.

Another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some method. For example, converting the alkyne into a primary alcohol and then oxidizing it.

Wait, but how would you get an aldehyde from an alkyne? One way is via theStephen reduction: alkyne to aldehyde via catalytic hydrogenation. Or, perhaps via hydroboration followed by oxidation.

Wait, wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then perhaps that's epoxidated or something else. But I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, but that's more likely for alkynes via oxymercuration or other methods.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. But how? Typically, alkynes can be converted to Grignard reagents via deprotonation, but I'm not sure.

Let's think about the options again. Let's look at each option and see what they do.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

So, step 1: NaNH2 and MeCl. As before, maybe alkylation of the alkyne. Then, H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. For ethynylcyclohexane, hydrogenation would make cyclohexane-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, the triple bond would become a single bond, so it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH3? No, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH, so after hydrogenation, it would become R-CH2-CH3, which is ethylcyclohexane. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Wait, but after hydrogenation, we have ethylcyclohexane. Ba(OH)2 is used for the Birch reduction or for elimination reactions, but I'm not sure. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration conditions for a triple bond? Wait, but the triple bond was already hydrogenated. Maybe that's not the correct path.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne, then ethyl chloride would alkylate, making R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination. Wait, but with what? Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonating something else. Step 3: O3 followed by H2O, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4: NH4OH, which might be for workup or amine.

But the starting material after step 1 is a longer alkyne. Ozonolysis of an alkyne? I'm a bit confused. Wait, ozonolysis is usually for alkenes. So, perhaps step 2 is for hydrogenation? No, because step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene via deprotonation and alkylation, then maybe a different step. Hmm, not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So, step 1: alkyne to R-C≡C-Me. Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3 would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. R-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, but that seems not useful. Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S as workup. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated first to an alkene, but wait, step 2 is H2 over Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So, step 3, ozone would do nothing because there's no double bond. Unless in step 2, the alkyne was partially hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. Wait, but H2/Pd-CaCO3 is for full hydrogenation. So, perhaps that's not correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol as the methyl source. Wait, methanol as an electrophile? Hmm, perhaps it's more about deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate the alkyne. Then, methanol would donate a methyl group? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form the cyclohexenide, which then reacts with methanol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step in each option is for alkyne alkylation. Let me think about what each first step does.

Option A: Alkyne treated with NaNH2 and MeCl → R-C≡C-Me.

Option B: R-C≡C- Et.

Option C: R-C≡C-Me.

Option D: R-C≡C-O-Me? Or maybe not, since MeOH is used as the electrophile. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the first step is for alkynide formation. So, the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2 in ammonia to form a cyclohexenide ion, which then reacts with an alkyl halide (like methyl chloride) in a substitution. So, R-C≡C⁻ + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3. So, the alkyne becomes a longer alkyne, now R-C≡C-CH3.

Then, what's next? Let's say we have R-C≡C-CH3. Next step in option A is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane. R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a propane chain attached to cyclohexane. Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination, but from where? Maybe Ba(OH)2 is for the Birch reduction, but Birch is for arenes. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in elimination reactions, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene. Let me think. If the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation with H2 and Lindlar catalyst would give cis-alkene, R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making a single bond. So, R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a longer alkane chain. Doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized into an aldehyde or ketone. Let me think about oxidation. HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O is for the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. So, if I have R-C≡CH, treatment with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would form R-C(O)-CH3, a ketone. But in option A, the last step is that. So, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So, that would convert any triple bonds to ketones. But if the triple bond was already hydrogenated, as in step 2, then step 4 wouldn't do anything.

Wait, but in option A, step 1 is alkylation of the alkyne, making R-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is for elimination. But the molecule now is R-CH2-CH2-Me. How would elimination work? Maybe forming a cyclohexene ring? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for the oxidation of an alcohol to ketone, but I don't see where the alcohol comes from yet.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group and an alcohol group. So, perhaps one step involves oxidation to aldehyde and another involves introducing the hydroxyl group.

Another approach: let's consider the target molecule's structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent at position 1 which is a CH group with OH, cyclohexyl, and maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH group which has an OH and an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol or something similar. Then, functionalized. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which can then be oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a substituent, then hydrogenated to a diol, then oxidized.

Wait, maybe the steps involve converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group via some method.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and MeCl (alkylation), H2/Pd (hydrogenation), O3/(CH3)2S (ozonolysis), Ba(OH)2.

So, after alkylation, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me. Hydrogenation (step 2) turns this into R-CH2-CH2-Me. Ozonolysis (step 3) would require a double bond, but the molecule after step 2 is a single bond. So, perhaps this step is incorrect.

Wait, unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the alkyne. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation to form a cis or trans alkene. But I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in step 2 to form an alkene, but I'm not sure which catalyst does that. Lindlar's catalyst is for cis hydrogenation, and using a poisoned catalyst could stop at the alkene. So maybe step 2 is a partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd is a catalyst for full hydrogenation, so it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, O3 would have nothing to react with, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that's probably not the right path.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and MeOH, then Li in liq NH3, then O3/(CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH. The alkyne is deprotonated to form cyclohexenide, which then reacts with MeOH. But MeOH is a weak electrophile. Maybe the cyclohexenide would attack MeOH, leading to R-C≡C-O-Me. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. Step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne? Not sure. Usually, ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So unless the alkyne is converted to a diene, this might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond, then ozonolysis.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexyl-methyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne to make it R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, but that doesn't help much.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched to form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, considering the hydration of the alkyne to a ketone. So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 is to hydrate it to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? No, earlier I thought that hydration would give a ketone, but maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like propyne) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O gives a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane with a ketone group, perhaps cyclohexanone. But that's a ketone, not an aldehyde. Hmm.

But the target molecule has an aldehyde. So perhaps the ketone is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But oxidation of a secondary alcohol doesn't give an aldehyde; it would require a primary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a primary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

How to get a primary alcohol from an alkyne? Oxymercuration would give a primary alcohol. But that requires a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then treated with something to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then undergoes some oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl chloride, then subjected to some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched with a carbonyl compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, maybe one of the steps is introducing the hydroxyl group via oxidation or via another method.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form a longer chain, then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, if I have R-C≡C-CH3 (after alkylation), then partial hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-CH3, then perhaps ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. But if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the alkyne in step 1 is R-C≡C-CH3. If step 2 is hydrogenation with a catalyst that stops at the alkene, like Lindlar's, then it would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3 as a cis alkene. No, wait, if the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. Ozonolysis can’t cleave that. So that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for a way to form a diol, which can then be oxidized to form a carbonyl. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to form R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's an alkane).

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized.

Wait, but how would you get a propargyl alcohol from the alkyne? Maybe via hydration with a different reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again. But that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to form a cyclohexanol derivative, then oxidize it to cyclohexanone, but I don't see how that leads to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the target molecule is formed via a coupling reaction, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation, the second is hydrogenation to form an alkene, the third is ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and the fourth step is to introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, let me think about option C again:

1. NaNH2 and MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, a straight chain.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination, but I'm not sure.

So, that doesn't seem to work.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

3. O3, H2O → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

4. NH4OH → not sure.

Hmm.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, MeOH → perhaps R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/NH3 → strong base, maybe elimination.

3. O3 → reacts with double bond to form ozonides.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, R is R-C≡C-OCH3.

Then, step 2, Li/NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating and eliminating to form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation and forming a carbanion, which could attack something else. Not sure.

Then step 3, O3 would need a double bond. So, perhaps the molecule after step 2 has a double bond. So, if step 2 produces a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how that would lead to the target molecule.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

- Partial hydrogenation to form R-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that's just a longer chain).

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol and then treated with a strong base to form an enolate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that is a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Perhaps the substituent comes from the alkyne. So, the alkyne is functionalized to add a methyl group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl substituent.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

For example, ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to R-C≡C-CH3 → convert triple bond to ketone (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) → R-C(O)-CH3. Then, perhaps reduce the ketone to an alcohol, then oxidize to aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

But looking at the options, the only option with HgSO4 and H2SO4 is option A, step 4. So, perhaps that's the hydration step.

Wait, let's see option A:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → ?

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which is the hydration step, but after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. So, step 4 would have nothing to react with. So, that can't be right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → no reaction, as no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond, but that's not helpful.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, MeOH → R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

3. O3 → needs a double bond, but not present.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene. So, R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? Not sure.

3. O3, H2O → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Wait, but then what would that give? For example, if step 3 cleaves the double bond, we could get two carbonyl groups. But how would that form the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via step 2, which is then ozonolysed into two carbonyl groups.

Then, the workup in step 4 would produce aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2, Li/NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation and elimination. But the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Elimination would require a β-hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in step 2 to a cis or trans alkene. So, step 2 would be hydrogenation with a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's) to form an alkene.

Then, step 3, ozonolysis, would cleave the alkene into two carbonyls.

Wait, let's imagine that. After step 2, we have R-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? No, wait, no. The starting alkyne after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So, hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, which is a single bond. Ozonolysis won't act on single bonds.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me try to map it out.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → No reaction, as no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is used in elimination reactions, such as the formation of alkenes from alcohols. But where would the alcohol come from?

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is for the oxidation of a diol to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a CH group with OH and cyclohexyl.

Perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form a longer chain, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde, and introducing the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which also has an OH and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the methyl group is being formed from the alkyne, and the OH is introduced via oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then reacted to form a cyclohexane ring.

But I'm not seeing that in the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents in each option.

Option C step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, sometimes used in the Birch reduction (but that's for aromatic rings), or for elimination reactions, like dehydrogenation. Alternatively, it's used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones.

Wait, perhaps step 4 in option C is for oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone. If step 3 in option C is ozonolysis, which would generate carbonyl groups, and step 4 is Ba(OH)2, maybe for further oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis doesn't do anything.

4. Ba(OH)2 for elimination, forming a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction. Let me think about the Ba(OH)2 step. Ba(OH)2 is also used in the oxidation of alcohols under certain conditions. For example, an alcohol with adjacent R groups can be oxidized to a ketone using Ba(OH)2. But the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl group. So, perhaps the alcohol is a primary alcohol, then oxidation would give an aldehyde.

Hmm, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis doesn't do anything.

4. Ba(OH)2 for oxidation of an alcohol to aldehyde. But where would the alcohol come from?

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C.

Wait, looking back at the target molecule, perhaps the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which also has an aldehyde. So, maybe the alkyne is converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then treated with a base to form an enolate, which can then be quenched to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched with HCHO (formaldehyde) to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how that ties into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing how the options fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not confident. Let me try to think through each option's possible products.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and MeCl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → No reaction, since no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination to form a double bond, but I don't see the necessary groups.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for oxidation. If, after step 2, there's an alcohol present, Ba(OH)2 could oxidize it. But where does the alcohol come from?

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. So, if step 3 somehow introduced a primary alcohol, step 4 would oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the primary alcohol in the steps.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

Looking back, the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, the synthesis must involve steps to introduce both groups. 

Option C has steps that might involve adding methyl, hydrogenating, ozonolysis (which doesn't do anything here), and Ba(OH)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C because it involves ozonolysis, which would create carbonyl groups. But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't work. So, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl. So, perhaps one of the steps is adding the cyclohexyl group via alkylation.

So, ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3 → hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → ozonolysis (but no double bond, so nothing) → Ba(OH)2 → ?

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again. But I'm not seeing how that forms the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then treated with a strong base to form an enolate, which then undergoes alkylation.

But again, I'm not seeing it.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option C as the correct answer. Because it's the only option that combines alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and Ba(OH)2, which might be used for oxidation or elimination.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent at the same position, which is a CH group attached to a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and the aldehyde. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: The alkyne is fully hydrogenated to R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but the molecule lacks functional groups that would react with Ba(OH)₂ at this stage.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: These reagents are used for hydrating alkynes to ketones, but the alkyne was already hydrogenated in step 2, so this step would not contribute.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not align with the target molecule, as the aldehyde group and hydroxyl group are not introduced.

---

#### **Option B:**
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the molecule lacks β-hydrogens to form a double bond.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely for workup, but the earlier steps do not set up the necessary intermediates for the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, as the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups are not introduced.

---

#### **Option C:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: The alkyne is fully hydrogenated to R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2, so this step does not contribute.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but the molecule lacks functional groups that would react with Ba(OH)₂ at this stage.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not align with the target molecule, as the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups are not introduced.

---

#### **Option D:**
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: The alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated, forming R-C≡C-OCH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the molecule lacks β-hydrogens to form a double bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely for workup, but the earlier steps do not set up the necessary intermediates for the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, as the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups are not introduced.

---

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the uncertainties in the steps.

**Answer: C**
