Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle. So, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have spin angular momentum with magnitude sqrt(s(s+1))ħ, where s=1/2, so sqrt(3/4)ħ, which is sqrt(3)/2 ħ. But maybe the magnetic moment is more relevant here.

The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. Oh right, the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. Wait, the question says mu = gamma * Sz, but wait, is that correct? Because the magnetic moment is usually proportional to the entire spin vector, not just the Sz component. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. Oh, well, the question says mu equals gamma times Sz, so I'll take it as given.

The setup is: the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.

Wait, when the first field is on (along Z), the particle's moment aligns with it. Then the field is turned off, so the magnetic field becomes zero. Then, another field along Y is turned on, same magnitude. So the new magnetic field is along Y. So the question is about what happens to the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, and specifically, its oscillation frequency.

The average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm, I recall that when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the initial direction of the magnetic moment, the system undergoes precession. But wait, in quantum mechanics, transitions can occur between spin states when the magnetic field changes. Or maybe it's more about the time evolution of the spin state in a changing field.

Wait, but the field is turned off and then on in a perpendicular direction. So initially, when the field is along Z, the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z. Then the field is turned off, so the system is in a free state—no external field, so the spin will just keep its state. But then the field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y.

So, after the field is turned on along Y, the system's Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu·B, but wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So when the field is along Y, H = -gamma Sz * B_y, but wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, and the interaction energy is H = -mu·B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma Sz * B_y. Wait, but B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So H = -gamma * (0, 0, S_z) · (0, B, 0) )? Wait, no, that would be zero. Because the dot product of (0,0,Sz) and (0,B,0) is zero. So H would be zero? That can't be right. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I need to think about the magnetic moment correctly. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for H. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, not just Sz. Oh, the question says mu = gamma * Sz, but that's a bit unusual because typically, the magnetic moment is proportional to the entire spin vector, not just the z-component. But the question says mu = gamma * Sz, so I have to go with that.

Wait, if mu is gamma Sz, then mu is a vector, right? So the magnetic moment vector is in the same direction as Sz. So when the field is along Z, mu is aligned, and when it's along Y, mu would have to be along Y as well. But wait, the spin is a vector, so when the field is in a different direction, the spin can precess around that field.

But wait, after the field is turned off. Let me think about the time evolution. Initially, the spin is in the +Z eigenstate, because the field is along Z. So after the field is turned off, the state remains in that eigenstate. But then a new field is applied along Y. So the system's Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, H = -gamma Sz B. Wait, but B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So H = -gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma B Sy. So the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, so H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is usually H = -mu·B, which is -gamma B (S·n), where n is the direction of the field. So here, n is along Y. So H = -gamma B Sy.

So the eigenstates of this H are the eigenstates of Sy. The energy eigenvalues would be E = ± (gamma B / 2), because Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, because Sy |±y> = ± ħ/2 |±y>.

But our initial state is the spin-up state along Z, say |+z>. So when the new field is turned on, the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H. Hence, the system will evolve in time under this Hamiltonian.

So to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z, since mu = gamma Sz, so mu_z = gamma S_z. So the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

So the average of S_z in the state |psi(t)> will oscillate, and we need to find the frequency of this oscillation.

The time evolution of the state under H is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

But let's compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the time dependence of the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the energy eigenstates and see how the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of these eigenstates, then compute the time evolution.

The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. Since Sy is the spin operator in the y-direction, let's find the eigenstates.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the initial state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

I remember that:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)
and |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, and those can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Yes, the correct relations are:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)
|-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

The time evolution under H will cause each component to pick up a phase factor.

H = -gamma B Sy, so the energies are E_+ = (-gamma B)(+ħ/2) = -gamma B ħ/2, and E_- = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ/2.

So the time evolution of each component is:

exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>
exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = ( exp(i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

We can factor out the exponentials:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} ( |+y> ) + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ( |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

Now, express this back in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

From the earlier expressions:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting these into |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me distribute:

= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (2)

where theta = gamma B t/2.

Expanding the terms:

= [ e^{i theta} |+z> + e^{i theta} |-z> + e^{-i theta} |+z> - e^{-i theta} |-z> ] / 2

Group terms with |+z> and |-z>:

= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |-z> ) ] / 2

We can recognize that:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta

So substituting:

= [ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |-z> ) ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |-z>

So the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

The S_z operator in the basis {|+z>, |-z>} has matrix elements:

S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>
S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2) |-z>

Compute <S_z>:

= [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) < +z | S_z |+z> + cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z |-z> + i sin(theta) * cos(theta) < -z | S_z |+z> + i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) < -z | S_z |-z>

But < +z | S_z |+z> = ħ/2, < +z | S_z |-z> =0, < -z | S_z |+z> =0, and < -z | S_z |-z> = - ħ/2.

So substituting:

= cos^2(theta) * (ħ/2) + i sin(theta) cos(theta) * 0 + i sin(theta) cos(theta) * 0 + i^2 sin^2(theta) * (- ħ/2)

Simplify:

= (ħ/2) cos²(theta) - (ħ/2) sin²(theta) [since i^2 = -1]

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) ]

But cos(2 theta) = cos²(theta) - sin²(theta), so:

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

But theta = gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

Wait, wait, wait: theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta would be gamma B t. So:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function. That is, the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The function is cos( gamma B t ), so the argument is 2 pi times (frequency) times t. So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency (in Hz) is (gamma B)/(2 pi), but the question is just about the oscillation frequency, which typically refers to the angular frequency, omega. But let me check the options.

The options are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

In our case, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma*B. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me go through again.

Wait, the state after time t is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = (gamma B/2) t.

The expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta). Because when you compute <S_z>, you get (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), and 2 theta is (gamma B) t.

So the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), which means the oscillation has an angular frequency omega = gamma B.

Which matches option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: When the magnetic field is along $+Z$, the particle is in the eigenstate $|+z\rangle$ of $S_z$. After the field is turned off, the state remains $|+z\rangle$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: When the magnetic field is turned on along $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma S_z \cdot B_y = -\gamma B S_y
   \]
   Here, $S_y$ is the spin operator in the $y$-direction.

3. **Eigenstates of $H$**: The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle)
   \]

4. **Time Evolution**: Under the Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$, the time evolution of the state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right)
   \]
   where $E_\pm = \pm \gamma B \hbar / 2$. Substituting these energies:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right)
   \]

5. **Expressing $|\psi(t)\rangle$ in Terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$**: Using the relations:
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle),
   \]
   the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)|-z\rangle
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle
   \]
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and using the eigenvalues of $S_z$, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]

7. **Oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**: Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the average $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of $t$ inside the cosine, which is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$, corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle. So, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have spin angular momentum with magnitude sqrt(s(s+1))ħ, where s=1/2, so sqrt(3/4)ħ, which is sqrt(3)/2 ħ. But maybe the magnetic moment is more relevant here.

So the question is about what happens to the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, and specifically, its oscillation frequency.

The average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

So the new Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y.

So, after the field is turned on along Y, the system's Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu·B, but wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So when the field is along Y, H = -gamma Sz * B_y, but wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, and the interaction energy is H = -mu·B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma Sz * B_y. Wait, but B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So H = -gamma * (0, 0, S_z) · (0, B, 0) )? Wait, no, that would be zero. Because the dot product of (0,0,Sz) and (0,B,0) is zero. So H would be zero? That can't be right. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I need to think about the magnetic moment correctly. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for H. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, not just Sz. Oh, the question says mu = gamma * Sz, but that's a bit unusual because typically, the magnetic moment is proportional to the entire spin vector, not just the z-component. But the question says mu = gamma * Sz, so I have to go with that.

Wait, if mu is gamma Sz, then mu is a vector, right? So the magnetic moment vector is in the same direction as Sz. So when the field is along Z, mu is aligned, and when it's along Y, mu would have to be along Y as well. But wait, the spin is a vector, so when the field is in a different direction, the spin can precess around that field.

But wait, after the field is turned off. Let me think about the time evolution. Initially, the spin is in the +Z eigenstate, because the field is along Z. So after the field is turned off, the state remains in that eigenstate. But then a new field is applied along Y. So the system's Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, H = -gamma Sz B. Wait, but B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So H = -gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma B Sy. So the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, so H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is usually H = -mu·B, which is -gamma B (S·n), where n is the direction of the field. So here, n is along Y. So H = -gamma B Sy.

So the eigenstates of this H are the eigenstates of Sy. The energy eigenvalues would be E = ± (gamma B / 2), because Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, because Sy |±y> = ± ħ/2 |±y>.

But our initial state is the spin-up state along Z, say |+z>. So when the new field is turned on, the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of H. Hence, the system will evolve in time under this Hamiltonian.

So to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z, since mu = gamma Sz, so mu_z = gamma S_z. So the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

So the average of S_z in the state |psi(t)> will oscillate, and we need to find the frequency of this oscillation.

The time evolution of the state under H is given by |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

But let's compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the time dependence of the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the energy eigenstates and see how the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of these eigenstates, then compute the time evolution.

The Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. Since Sy is the spin operator in the y-direction, let's find the eigenstates.

The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the initial state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

I remember that:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)
and |-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, and those can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Yes, the correct relations are:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)
|-z> = (|+y> - |-y>)/sqrt(2)

So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

The time evolution under H will cause each component to pick up a phase factor.

H = -gamma B Sy, so the energies are E_+ = (-gamma B)(+ħ/2) = -gamma B ħ/2, and E_- = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ/2.

So the time evolution of each component is:

exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>
exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = ( exp(i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

We can factor out the exponentials:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} ( |+y> ) + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } ( |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

Now, express this back in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

From the earlier expressions:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting these into |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me distribute:

= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |-z>) ] / (2)

where theta = gamma B t/2.

Expanding the terms:

= [ e^{i theta} |+z> + e^{i theta} |-z> + e^{-i theta} |+z> - e^{-i theta} |-z> ] / 2

Group terms with |+z> and |-z>:

= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |-z> ) ] / 2

We can recognize that:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta
e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta

So substituting:

= [ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |-z> ) ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |-z>

So the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

The S_z operator in the basis {|+z>, |-z>} has matrix elements:

S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>
S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2) |-z>

Compute <S_z>:

= [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) < +z | S_z |+z> + cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z |-z> + i sin(theta) * cos(theta) < -z | S_z |+z> + i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) < -z | S_z |-z>

But < +z | S_z |+z> = ħ/2, < +z | S_z |-z> =0, < -z | S_z |+z> =0, and < -z | S_z |-z> = - ħ/2.

So substituting:

= cos^2(theta) * (ħ/2) + i sin(theta) cos(theta) * 0 + i sin(theta) cos(theta) * 0 + i^2 sin^2(theta) * (- ħ/2)

Simplify:

= (ħ/2) cos²(theta) - (ħ/2) sin²(theta) [since i^2 = -1]

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) ]

But cos(2 theta) = cos²(theta) - sin²(theta), so:

= (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta)

But theta = gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

Wait, wait, wait: theta is gamma B t/2, so 2 theta would be gamma B t. So:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function. That is, the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The function is cos( gamma B t ), so the argument is 2 pi times (frequency) times t. So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency (in Hz) is (gamma B)/(2 pi), but the question is just about the oscillation frequency, which typically refers to the angular frequency, omega. But let me check the options.

The options are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

In our case, the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma*B. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me go through again.

Wait, the state after time t is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, where theta = (gamma B/2) t.

The expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta). Because when you compute <S_z>, you get (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), and 2 theta is (gamma B) t.

So the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), which means the oscillation has an angular frequency omega = gamma B.

Which matches option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: When the magnetic field is along $+Z$, the particle is in the eigenstate $|+z\rangle$ of $S_z$. After the field is turned off, the state remains $|+z\rangle$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: When the magnetic field is turned on along $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma S_z \cdot B_y = -\gamma B S_y

   Here, $S_y$ is the spin operator in the $y$-direction.

3. **Eigenstates of $H$**: The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle)
   \]

4. **Time Evolution**: Under the Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$, the time evolution of the state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right)
   \]
   where $E_\pm = \pm \gamma B \hbar / 2$. Substituting these energies:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right)
   \]

5. **Expressing $|\psi(t)\rangle$ in Terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$**: Using the relations:
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle),
   \]
   the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)|-z\rangle
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle
   \]
   Substituting $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and using the eigenvalues of $S_z$, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]

7. **Oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**: Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the average $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of $t$ inside the cosine, which is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$, corresponding to **Option B**.
