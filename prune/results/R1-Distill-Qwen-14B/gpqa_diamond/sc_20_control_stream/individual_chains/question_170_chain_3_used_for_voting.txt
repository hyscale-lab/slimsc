Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that means the spin state vector is a two-component vector. So in bra-ket notation, it would be |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵀ, right? Or wait, maybe it's written as a column vector, so the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

The expectation value of S_y is what we're looking for. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on this state.

The formula for the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So I need to find that.

But wait, what's S_y in terms of matrices? Oh right, the Pauli matrices! Right, the spin operator S along a direction is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ. So S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y.

And σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So putting that together, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So to compute the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† (S_y) ψ, where ψ is the state vector. Let me write that out.

The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So its conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3, 4i ] because the first component is 3i, whose conjugate is -3? Wait wait, no. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i? Wait wait, no, wait: 3i is a purely imaginary number, so its conjugate is -3i. So the first component of ψ† is 3i*, which is -3i. Wait no, wait. Wait, ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† is [ (3i)* , (4)* ] , which is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector. Wait, because 3i is 3 multiplied by i, so its conjugate is -3i. Or wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the components. Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector with the conjugate of each component.

So ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† is [3i*, 4*] which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i; 4].

Let me compute that step by step.

First, let's compute the matrix multiplication. So let's compute σ_y multiplied by the state vector ψ.

σ_y * ψ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i; 4] 

So first component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i². But i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, multiply this by ψ†, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait a second. So the entire thing is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result.

So expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, they have fractions like 25 in the denominator. So where am I going wrong?

Ah, wait. Oh! The state vector must be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a norm of 1. Otherwise, the probabilities won't add up to one.

So I need to check if the given state vector is normalized. Let's compute the norm squared of ψ.

The norm squared is (3i)*(3i)* (conjugate) + 4*4.

Wait, ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2.

|3i|^2 is (3)^2 =9. |4|^2 is 16. So 9+16=25. So the norm is 5, because sqrt(25) is 5. Therefore, the state is not normalized. So to get a normalized state, we should divide by the norm, which is 5.

So the correct state is (1/5)[3i, 4]^T. Oh wait, wait, the original state is given as (3i,4). So I think the state is given as a vector, but isn't normalized. So in the expectation value calculation, we need to normalize it.

So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, which is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, because the state isn't normalized.

Wait, no. Wait. The expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ), because the state is not normalized. Because the expectation value is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩), since the state is not normalized.

So let me recalculate. So ψ is [3i,4]^T. Its norm squared is 25, as before.

So the normalized state is ψ_norm = (1/5) [3i,4]^T.

So the expectation value is ⟨ψ_norm | S_y | ψ_norm ⟩.

Alternatively, it can be computed as (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ). Because ψ† ψ is 25, and ψ† S_y ψ is -24 ħ/2? Wait, no: earlier I computed ψ† S_y ψ as (ħ/2)*(-24). Let me re-express that.

Wait, going back, earlier I got ψ† S_y ψ as (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

But that's without normalization. So the actual expectation value is that divided by the norm squared, which is 25. So (-12 ħ) / 25.

Wait, but wait, in the earlier calculation, I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute. So ψ is [3i,4]^T.

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me compute S_y ψ:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * σ_y * ψ.

As before, σ_y * ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So S_y ψ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ].

Then, ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ].

So the inner product is:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3)

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (-24) * (ħ/2) = -12 ħ.

So that's the numerator. The denominator is ψ† ψ, which is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 +16 =25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ) /25. So that's option A.

Wait, option A is -12 ħ /25, which matches this result. So the answer is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. So that's the correct expectation value.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Spin Operator \( S_y \)
The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:
\[
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
\]
where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation Value Formula
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle}.
\]
Here, \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \) ensures normalization of the state vector.

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \)
The norm squared of the state vector is:
\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
\psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle \)
First, calculate \( \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The dot product is:
\[
(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot (-24) = -12\hbar.
\]

### Step 5: Normalize the Expectation Value
The expectation value is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
