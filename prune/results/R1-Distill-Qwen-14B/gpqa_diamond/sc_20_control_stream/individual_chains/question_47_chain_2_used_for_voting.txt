Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which usually means a combination of rings and double bonds. Five could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (another), and an amide group (but wait, amide has a double bond, so maybe that's included). Hmm, not sure yet, but let's see.

Now, looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, which suggests N-H or O-H stretching. Since the molecular formula has an N and O, maybe it's an amide (N-H) or an alcohol (O-H). But the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong band, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like amide, ester, ketone, etc.). So the compound probably has a carbonyl.

The 1H NMR data: 
- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad signals can be from -OH or -NH groups. Since it's a singlet, maybe it's an NH2 or an NH group. Wait, but the molecular formula has only one N... So maybe an NH group. But in what context? Also, considering the IR, if there's a broad peak around 3300, that could be N-H.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like an OCH2CH2- group. Or perhaps a carbonyl attached to a CH2. Wait, quartet with 2H... So that's a -OCH2- group maybe, but then what's next to it? Or maybe a CH2 connected to something else. Let me think. For example, an ester group: O-CO-O. Wait, in an ester, the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen would be split by neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe a propionamide structure.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each proton is equivalent and gives a doublet when coupled with the two adjacent protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents, each in the para position. Wait, but two doublets would mean two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So perhaps the substituents are in the para position relative to each other. For example, in 4-ethoxybenzamide or similar.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy group at position 3. The aromatic protons would be ortho, meta, and para to the substituents. But wait, if it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are at positions 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (amide group, assuming numbering). Then the aromatic H's would be at positions 2,4,5,6. But for benzamide, the amide is at position 1, ethoxy at 3. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two at para to each substituent? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe for benzamide, the amide is in para to the ethoxy? Wait, no, 3-ethoxy would be meta to the amide.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the substituents are ethoxy at position 4 and formamide (which is like a CONH2 group) at position 1. Wait, no, formamide is R-NH-C=O, so in this case, the benzene ring would have ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. But wait, 4-ethoxyphenyl would have the ethoxy at position 4. Then the formamide group would be attached at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. So the coupling would lead to two doublets as in the NMR. So perhaps the H's at positions 2 and 6 are one doublet, and positions 3 and 5 another? Or maybe it's a different splitting. I'm not entirely sure, but the NMR shows two doublets, which might fit a para-substituted benzene, but I'm not certain yet.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate group. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached via the amino group? Wait, no. Propionate would be like CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene via an amide bond? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid attached to an amino group. Alternatively, structure: benzene with NH2 at position 4, and a propiono group attached as an ester or amide. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, maybe the amino group. Wait, but amines can show broad signals, but in this case, if it's a secondary amide, perhaps. Alternatively, the 4.5 ppm quartet could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group. So for propionate, the structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. The NMR would then have the CH2 groups, but let me think. The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of a propyl group. Then the quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 next to the oxygen. The triplet at 1.20 suggests a CH2CH3, so perhaps an ethyl group. Wait, but in propionate, it's CH2CH2COO-, so maybe a triplet for the CH2CH3 would be in the ethyl part, but I'm not sure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's a benzoate ester with an ethyl group, and an amino group at position 4. So structure: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. Now, let's think about the NMR. The 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH2CH3 of the ethyl ester. The quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 connected to the oxygen in the ester (OCH2CH3). Then the 4.0 ppm broad singlet could be the NH2 group. Wait, but in the IR, we saw peaks around 3420 and 3325, which are broad, suggesting N-H or O-H. If it's an amine, then the -NH2 would show up as a broad peak. So the singlet at 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group. But wait, in D, the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be expected as a broad signal, but perhaps in some cases, it might not show up clearly if it's exchanging rapidly, but in this case, the integration is 2H, which suggests maybe a single proton each? Wait, no, the integration is 2H for the singlet at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but -NH2 has two H's. So maybe that's the case. 

Looking again at the aromatic region. For 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the benzene would have H's at positions 2,3,5,6. The H at position 2 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H at position 6 would be ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. H at position 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2. Wait, perhaps the coupling would result in two doublets. Let me think, the substituents are para to each other (COOEt at 1, NH2 at 4). The H's would be at 2,3,5,6. H2 and H6 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H3 and H5 would be ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. So in the aromatic region, H2 and H6 would be each coupled to H3 and H5, leading to doublets. Wait, maybe that's not correct because each H is adjacent to two others. Alternatively, perhaps each pair (2 and 6) are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. So perhaps you get two doublets: one for H2 and H6, and another for H3 and H5? Or maybe it's more complex. 

But looking back, the NMR shows two doublets: one at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). That suggests that the two doublets are each integrating for two protons. So perhaps the two sets of two equivalent protons. So in the case of 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester, the H's might split into two doublets. Let me think about substituents on benzene. If substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring is symmetric. So H2 and H6 would be equivalent, and H3 and H5 would be equivalent. Each of these pairs would be adjacent to substituents. H2 and H6 are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H3 and H5 are ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. So the H2 and H6 would be deshielded more than H3 and H5? Or perhaps the opposite. The electron-withdrawing groups (like COO-) deshield the protons. So H2 and H6 are ortho to COOEt, which is an EWG, so they would be deshielded and appear downfield. H3 and H5 are ortho to NH2, which is an EDG, so they would be less deshielded and appear upfield. So H2 and H6 would be around 8.0 ppm as doublets, and H3 and H5 around 7.0 ppm as doublets. That matches the NMR data: 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d, 2H). So that seems to fit.

Now, let's look at the other NMR signals. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH2CH3 of the ethyl group. The singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) would be the NH2 group. But wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene ring with COOEt at 1 and NH2 at 4. So molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Because: benzene (6 C), COOEt is (COOCH2CH3) adds 3 C (COO is 2, CH2CH3 is 2 but one is connected), wait:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you esterify with ethanol, you get C7H5O2 + C2H5OH → C9H10O2 plus water. But wait, the formula here is C9H11NO2. So maybe it's 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with an NH2 group replacing a H, so the formula would be C7H7NO2. When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the ester would be C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So that fits.

Now, checking the IR. Strong band at 1720 cm-1: that's a carbonyl, which fits the ester (COO-) or the amide. But in option D, it's an ester, so the carbonyl is from the ester. Additionally, the IR has peaks around 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are broad. In D, the NH2 group would have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, which matches. Also, the O-H stretch is usually around 3200-3600, but since it's an ester, O-H (if any) would be from alcohol, but in this case, the ester doesn't have free O-H. So the broad peaks are likely from the NH2 group.

Looking back at the NMR: the quartet at 4.5 ppm is likely the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. Because in an ester, the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen is split by the neighboring CH3. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH2CH3 group. The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which makes sense because exchange broadening is common for amines.

Other options: Let's briefly check them.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would have benzamide (CONH2) and ethoxy at position 3. The aromatic H's would be at positions 2,4,5,6. Would that give two doublets? Maybe not, because the substituents are in meta and para positions, leading to more complex splitting. Also, the NMR would have the ethoxy group as a quartet or triplet. The IR would show the CONH2 amide peak around 1650 cm-1, but the given IR is higher at 1720, which is more ester-like. So probably not A.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents are ethoxy at 4 and formamide (which has a CONH2 group) at 1. The aromatic H's would be in positions 2,3,5,6. So the substituents are at 1 and 4. For the aromatic protons, H2 and H6 would be ortho to formamide and meta to ethoxy, and H3 and H5 would be ortho to ethoxy and meta to formamide. So the H2 and H6 would be downfield due to ortho to EWG (formamide's carbonyl), and H3 and H5 would be upfield because ortho to EDG (ethoxy). So the NMR would have two doublets, which matches. Now, the other NMR signals. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3), and a quartet around 4.0 ppm (OCH2). The formamide group's NH2 would be a broad signal, but in the NMR, the singlet at 4.0 is 2H, and the HCONH would have its NH2 somewhere. But wait, the 1H NMR given has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would fit the OCH2 of ethoxy. So maybe that's the case. Then the formamide's NH2 would be showing up as a broad signal elsewhere. Hmm, but in the NMR provided, the singlet at 4.0 ppm is 2H, which could be the OCH2 of ethoxy, but in this case, ethoxy is at 4, so the OCH2 would be at around 4.0 ppm, but the triplet would be the ethyl group. Wait, but in the given NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), which is the CH2CH3. Quartet at 4.5 (2H) would be the OCH2. But in option B, the ethoxy is attached to the benzene, so the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0 ppm (since it's split by the CH3). Wait, but in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. That might not fit. Also, the formamide's carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1 in IR, but the given IR has 1720, which is higher, suggesting an ester or maybe a ketone, which formamide doesn't have. So maybe B isn't the right option.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure: benzene with NH2 at 4 and propiono group (CH2CH2COO-) attached as an ester or amide. If it's an amide, the structure would be different. But propionate ester would have CH2CH2COO-. The NMR would have the CH2 groups from the propyl chain. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) would be the CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) would be the CH2 next to COO-. Also, the NH2 would be a broad singlet at 4.0 (2H), which matches. The aromatic protons would be similar to option D, but with substituents at 4 (NH2) and the propionate at 1. So the aromatic H's would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents are at 1 and 4, so similar to D's aromatic splitting. So the aromatic NMR would have two doublets. But the molecular formula for propionate ethyl ester would be different. Wait, let's calculate: benzene (6 C) + propionate (3 C for COOCH2CH2CH3?) Wait, propionate is RCOO- where R is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The ethyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, but that's four C in the ester part (COO and ethyl). So molecular formula would be C6 (benzene) + 3 (COO-) + 2 (ethyl) = C11? No, wait, original formula is C9H11NO2. So perhaps the propionate is a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propionamide, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is attached as an amide, but that would change the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), a quartet at 4.5 (CH2 next to something), and a broad singlet at 4.0 (NH2). So let's see. For option C, if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be benzene with NH2 at 4 and a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group attached. The propionate would have a triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (CH2 connected to COO), and a triplet around maybe 2.4 ppm for the CH2 connected to COO. But wait, the given NMR doesn't have a triplet in that region. So perhaps option C doesn't fit the NMR data as well as D.

So going back, option D seems to fit the NMR and IR data. The aromatic protons split into two doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm), the ethyl group's triplet and quartet, the NH2 as a broad singlet, and the carbonyl from the ester. So I think option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound to be identified has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, with a degree of unsaturation of 5, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees) and additional unsaturation (likely from a carbonyl group). The spectroscopic data provided includes:

### IR Data:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad peaks, suggesting the presence of an N-H group (amide or amine).
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, indicating a CH₂CH₃ group (ethyl group).
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an NH₂ group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen in an ester).
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This compound has a benzamide group (CONH₂) and an ethoxy group at position 3. The aromatic protons would not split into two doublets due to the meta substitution pattern. Additionally, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more consistent with an ester than an amide. This option does not fit the data.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This compound has a formamide group (HCONH₂) and an ethoxy group at position 4. The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR data. However, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is inconsistent with a formamide, as formamide carbonyls typically absorb around 1650 cm⁻¹. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This compound has an NH₂ group at position 4 and a propionate group (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) attached to the benzene ring. The NMR would show signals for the CH₂ groups in the propionate chain, which are not observed in the given data. Additionally, the molecular formula does not align with the structure. This option does not fit the data.

4. **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This compound has a para-substituted benzene ring with a COOEt group at position 1 and an NH₂ group at position 4. The aromatic protons split into two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), consistent with the para substitution pattern. The ethyl group contributes a triplet at 1.20 ppm and a quartet at 4.5 ppm, matching the NMR data. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH₂ group, and the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the ester carbonyl. This option fits all the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which usually means a combination of rings and double bonds. Five could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (another), and an amide group (but wait, amide has a double bond, so maybe that's included). Hmm, not sure yet, but let's see.

Now, looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, which suggests N-H or O-H stretching. Since the molecular formula has an N and O, maybe it's an amide (N-H) or an alcohol (O-H). But the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong band, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like amide, ester, ketone, etc.). So the compound probably has a carbonyl.

The 1H NMR data: 
- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad signals can be from -OH or -NH groups. Since it's a singlet, maybe it's an NH2 or an NH group. Wait, but the molecular formula has only one N... So maybe an NH group. But in what context? Also, considering the IR, if there's a broad peak around 3300, that could be N-H.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like an OCH2CH2- group. Or perhaps a carbonyl attached to a CH2. Wait, quartet with 2H... So that's a -OCH2- group maybe, but then what's next to it? Or maybe a CH2 connected to something else. Let me think. For example, an ester group: O-CO-O. Wait, in an ester, the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen would be split by neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe a propionamide structure.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each proton is equivalent and gives a doublet when coupled with the two adjacent protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents, each in the para position. Wait, but two doublets would mean two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So perhaps the substituents are in the para position relative to each other. For example, in 4-ethoxybenzamide or similar.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy group at position 3. The aromatic protons would be ortho, meta, and para to the substituents. But wait, if it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are at positions 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (amide group, assuming numbering). Then the aromatic H's would be at positions 2,4,5,6. But for benzamide, the amide is at position 1, ethoxy at 3. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two at para to each substituent? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe for benzamide, the amide is in para to the ethoxy? Wait, no, 3-ethoxy would be meta to the amide.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the substituents are ethoxy at position 4 and formamide (which is like a CONH2 group) at position 1. Wait, no, formamide is R-NH-C=O, so in this case, the benzene ring would have ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. But wait, 4-ethoxyphenyl would have the ethoxy at position 4. Then the formamide group would be attached at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. So the coupling would lead to two doublets as in the NMR. So perhaps the H's at positions 2 and 6 are one doublet, and positions 3 and 5 another? Or maybe it's a different splitting. I'm not entirely sure, but the NMR shows two doublets, which might fit a para-substituted benzene, but I'm not certain yet.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate group. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached via the amino group? Wait, no. Propionate would be like CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene via an amide bond? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid attached to an amino group. Alternatively, structure: benzene with NH2 at position 4, and a propiono group attached as an ester or amide. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, maybe the amino group. Wait, but amines can show broad signals, but in this case, if it's a secondary amide, perhaps. Alternatively, the 4.5 ppm quartet could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group. So for propionate, the structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. The NMR would then have the CH2 groups, but let me think. The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of a propyl group. Then the quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 next to the oxygen. The triplet at 1.20 suggests a CH2CH3, so perhaps an ethyl group. Wait, but in propionate, it's CH2CH2COO-, so maybe a triplet for the CH2CH3 would be in the ethyl part, but I'm not sure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's a benzoate ester with an ethyl group, and an amino group at position 4. So structure: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. Now, let's think about the NMR. The 1.20 ppm triplet is the CH2CH3 of the ethyl ester. The quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 connected to the oxygen in the ester (OCH2CH3). Then the 4.0 ppm broad singlet could be the NH2 group. Wait, but in the IR, we saw peaks around 3420 and 3325, which are broad, suggesting N-H or O-H. If it's an amine, then the -NH2 would show up as a broad peak. So the singlet at 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group. But wait, in D, the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be expected as a broad signal, but perhaps in some cases, it might not show up clearly if it's exchanging rapidly, but in this case, the integration is 2H, which suggests maybe a single proton each? Wait, no, the integration is 2H for the singlet at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but -NH2 has two H's. So maybe that's the case. 

Looking again at the aromatic region. For 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the benzene would have H's at positions 2,3,5,6. The H at position 2 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H at position 6 would be ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. H at position 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2. Wait, perhaps the coupling would result in two doublets. Let me think, the substituents are para to each other (COOEt at 1, NH2 at 4). The H's would be at 2,3,5,6. H2 and H6 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H3 and H5 would be ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. So in the aromatic region, H2 and H6 would be each coupled to H3 and H5, leading to doublets. Wait, maybe that's not correct because each H is adjacent to two others. Alternatively, perhaps each pair (2 and 6) are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. So perhaps you get two doublets: one for H2 and H6, and another for H3 and H5? Or maybe it's more complex. 

But looking back, the NMR shows two doublets: one at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). That suggests that the two doublets are each integrating for two protons. So perhaps the two sets of two equivalent protons. So in the case of 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester, the H's might split into two doublets. Let me think about substituents on benzene. If substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring is symmetric. So H2 and H6 would be equivalent, and H3 and H5 would be equivalent. Each of these pairs would be adjacent to substituents. H2 and H6 are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H3 and H5 are ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. So the H2 and H6 would be deshielded more than H3 and H5? Or perhaps the opposite. The electron-withdrawing groups (like COO-) deshield the protons. So H2 and H6 are ortho to COOEt, which is an EWG, so they would be deshielded and appear downfield. H3 and H5 are ortho to NH2, which is an EDG, so they would be less deshielded and appear upfield. So H2 and H6 would be around 8.0 ppm as doublets, and H3 and H5 around 7.0 ppm as doublets. That matches the NMR data: 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d, 2H). So that seems to fit.

Now, let's look at the other NMR signals. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH2CH3 of the ethyl group. The singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) would be the NH2 group. But wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene ring with COOEt at 1 and NH2 at 4. So molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Because: benzene (6 C), COOEt is (COOCH2CH3) adds 3 C (COO is 2, CH2CH3 is 2 but one is connected), wait:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you esterify with ethanol, you get C7H5O2 + C2H5OH → C9H10O2 plus water. But wait, the formula here is C9H11NO2. So maybe it's 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with an NH2 group replacing a H, so the formula would be C7H7NO2. When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the ester would be C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So that fits.

Now, checking the IR. Strong band at 1720 cm-1: that's a carbonyl, which fits the ester (COO-) or the amide. But in option D, it's an ester, so the carbonyl is from the ester. Additionally, the IR has peaks around 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are broad. In D, the NH2 group would have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, which matches. Also, the O-H stretch is usually around 3200-3600, but since it's an ester, O-H (if any) would be from alcohol, but in this case, the ester doesn't have free O-H. So the broad peaks are likely from the NH2 group.

Looking back at the NMR: the quartet at 4.5 ppm is likely the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. Because in an ester, the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen is split by the neighboring CH3. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH2CH3 group. The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which makes sense because exchange broadening is common for amines.

Other options: Let's briefly check them.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would have benzamide (CONH2) and ethoxy at position 3. The aromatic H's would be at positions 2,4,5,6. Would that give two doublets? Maybe not, because the substituents are in meta and para positions, leading to more complex splitting. Also, the NMR would have the ethoxy group as a quartet or triplet. The IR would show the CONH2 amide peak around 1650 cm-1, but the given IR is higher at 1720, which is more ester-like. So probably not A.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents are ethoxy at 4 and formamide (which has a CONH2 group) at 1. The aromatic H's would be in positions 2,3,5,6. So the substituents are at 1 and 4. For the aromatic protons, H2 and H6 would be ortho to formamide and meta to ethoxy, and H3 and H5 would be ortho to ethoxy and meta to formamide. So the H2 and H6 would be downfield due to ortho to EWG (formamide's carbonyl), and H3 and H5 would be upfield because ortho to EDG (ethoxy). So the NMR would have two doublets, which matches. Now, the other NMR signals. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3), and a quartet around 4.0 ppm (OCH2). The formamide group's NH2 would be a broad signal, but in the NMR, the singlet at 4.0 is 2H, and the HCONH would have its NH2 somewhere. But wait, the 1H NMR given has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would fit the OCH2 of ethoxy. So maybe that's the case. Then the formamide's NH2 would be showing up as a broad signal elsewhere. Hmm, but in the NMR provided, the singlet at 4.0 ppm is 2H, which could be the OCH2 of ethoxy, but in this case, ethoxy is at 4, so the OCH2 would be at around 4.0 ppm, but the triplet would be the ethyl group. Wait, but in the given NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), which is the CH2CH3. Quartet at 4.5 (2H) would be the OCH2. But in option B, the ethoxy is attached to the benzene, so the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0 ppm (since it's split by the CH3). Wait, but in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. That might not fit. Also, the formamide's carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1 in IR, but the given IR has 1720, which is higher, suggesting an ester or maybe a ketone, which formamide doesn't have. So maybe B isn't the right option.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure: benzene with NH2 at 4 and propiono group (CH2CH2COO-) attached as an ester or amide. If it's an amide, the structure would be different. But propionate ester would have CH2CH2COO-. The NMR would have the CH2 groups from the propyl chain. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) would be the CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) would be the CH2 next to COO-. Also, the NH2 would be a broad singlet at 4.0 (2H), which matches. The aromatic protons would be similar to option D, but with substituents at 4 (NH2) and the propionate at 1. So the aromatic H's would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents are at 1 and 4, so similar to D's aromatic splitting. So the aromatic NMR would have two doublets. But the molecular formula for propionate ethyl ester would be different. Wait, let's calculate: benzene (6 C) + propionate (3 C for COOCH2CH2CH3?) Wait, propionate is RCOO- where R is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The ethyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, but that's four C in the ester part (COO and ethyl). So molecular formula would be C6 (benzene) + 3 (COO-) + 2 (ethyl) = C11? No, wait, original formula is C9H11NO2. So perhaps the propionate is a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propionamide, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is attached as an amide, but that would change the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), a quartet at 4.5 (CH2 next to something), and a broad singlet at 4.0 (NH2). So let's see. For option C, if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be benzene with NH2 at 4 and a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group attached. The propionate would have a triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (CH2 connected to COO), and a triplet around maybe 2.4 ppm for the CH2 connected to COO. But wait, the given NMR doesn't have a triplet in that region. So perhaps option C doesn't fit the NMR data as well as D.

So going back, option D seems to fit the NMR and IR data. The aromatic protons split into two doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm), the ethyl group's triplet and quartet, the NH2 as a broad singlet, and the carbonyl from the ester. So I think option D is the correct answer.


The compound to be identified has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, with a degree of unsaturation of 5, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees) and additional unsaturation (likely from a carbonyl group). The spectroscopic data provided includes:

### IR Data:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Broad peaks, suggesting the presence of an N-H group (amide or amine).
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, indicating a CH₂CH₃ group (ethyl group).
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an NH₂ group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen in an ester).
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This compound has a benzamide group (CONH₂) and an ethoxy group at position 3. The aromatic protons would not split into two doublets due to the meta substitution pattern. Additionally, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more consistent with an ester than an amide. This option does not fit the data.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This compound has a formamide group (HCONH₂) and an ethoxy group at position 4. The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR data. However, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is inconsistent with a formamide, as formamide carbonyls typically absorb around 1650 cm⁻¹. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This compound has an NH₂ group at position 4 and a propionate group (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) attached to the benzene ring. The NMR would show signals for the CH₂ groups in the propionate chain, which are not observed in the given data. Additionally, the molecular formula does not align with the structure. This option does not fit the data.

4. **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This compound has a para-substituted benzene ring with a COOEt group at position 1 and an NH₂ group at position 4. The aromatic protons split into two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), consistent with the para substitution pattern. The ethyl group contributes a triplet at 1.20 ppm and a quartet at 4.5 ppm, matching the NMR data. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH₂ group, and the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the ester carbonyl. This option fits all the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
