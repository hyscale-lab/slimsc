Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The setup is that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. When they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^(-0.5i), but I think the minus is part of the expression. Or maybe it's a complex function with a real and imaginary part? Because the i is the square root of -1.

Wait, but for a wave function to be physically meaningful, it must be square-integrable and normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. But the problem says that when they measure, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside this region.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that doesn't seem to be zero anywhere except perhaps where 1/sqrt(1+x) equals a certain value. So maybe the wave function isn't zero except when a/sqrt(1+x) equals 0.5i. But that would require sqrt(1+x) to be (a)/(0.5i), which is a complex number. Hmm, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the wave function.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^(-0.5i x), but that's not what's written. The given expression is ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. Wait, perhaps I should parse it correctly. The actual wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something. Oh wait, no, the given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because if this is the entire wave function, it's a complex function. But for the probability density, we need the modulus squared.

Wait, but maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^(-0.5i), which would make it a complex exponential. But in the problem statement, it's written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's an odd way to write a wave function. Oh wait, perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-0.5i something} but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 +x)) multiplied by a complex constant, -0.5i. Because the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that might not make much sense because then the wave function would be a function of x, but the second term is a constant. Or maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but that's speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) multiplied by e^{-i(0.5)}, which is a constant phase factor. Because e^{-iθ} is cosθ - isinθ. If θ is 0.5 radians, then e^{-i0.5} is cos(0.5) - i sin(0.5) ≈ 0.87758 - i 0.4794. So maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) multiplied by that phase factor. But the problem statement isn't clear on that.

Wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Let me think. So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5 i. But that would be a complex function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that can't be right, because the modulus squared would then be [a^2 / (1+x)] + 0.25. So the probability density would be [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. But that's a problem because the wave function isn't normalized properly. Also, the imaginary part doesn't depend on x, which is odd.

Wait, maybe the wave function is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-ikx}, but that's not what's written. Let me reread the question.

The question says: wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-0.5i}, but that's not how it's written. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but that would be (a (1 - 0.5i)) / sqrt(1 +x). Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the wave function is given as ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. So for each x, this is a complex number. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that would imply that the wave function has a real part that decreases as x increases, and an imaginary part that's constant. But that's a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is written as a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i 0.5}, which would make ψ(x) a complex function with both real and imaginary parts that depend on x. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3 because the particles are only found there. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and non-zero between 1 and 3. So for x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) =0.

But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. So to make this zero for x<1 and x>3, we have to have (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i =0.

Wait, but that would require a / sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i. But sqrt(1+x) is a real number for x >= -1, which it is in our case since x starts at 1. So sqrt(1+x) is real. So a must be a complex number to make a/sqrt(1+x) equal 0.5i. Which would mean a is 0.5i * sqrt(1+x). But that can't be, because a is a constant, not dependent on x.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the expression. Maybe the wave function is zero outside the interval [1,3], but the given wave function is non-zero only in that region. So perhaps the given wave function ψ(x) is defined only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i.

Hmm, maybe the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 +x)) for 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero otherwise. But the given wave function has this minus 0.5i part, which suggests it's a complex function. But if ψ(x)=0 outside 1 and 3, then in that region, (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i must be zero. So a/sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i. But sqrt(1+x) is real, so a must be 0.5i multiplied by sqrt(1+x). But a is a constant, so that can't be. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the wave function as given is correct only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So inside the interval, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i, and outside it's zero. But that would mean that the modulus squared is |a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i|^2 which is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. But that doesn't depend on x for the imaginary part. Hmm, but that would mean the wave function's modulus squared is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. But the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 should be 1, because the wave function must be normalized.

Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, then the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 from -infinity to infinity is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx. So |ψ(x)|^2 is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms would involve real and imaginary parts. Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. The modulus squared is ψ(x)*ψ(x)* = [a / sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply out, the cross terms cancel. So |ψ(x)|^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

So let's set up the integral:

Integral (from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two terms:

a² * Integral (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Compute each part.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second term is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So overall:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ approximately 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since the problem states that particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this interval. Therefore, the normalization integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two terms:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

1. Compute the first integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

2. Compute the second integral:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3 because the particles are only found there. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and non-zero between 1 and 3. So for x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) =0.

But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. So to make this zero for x<1 and x>3, we have to have (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i =0.

Wait, but that would require a / sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i. But sqrt(1+x) is a real number for x >= -1, which it is in our case since x starts at 1. So sqrt(1+x) is real. So a must be a complex number to make a/sqrt(1+x) equal 0.5i. Which would mean a is 0.5i * sqrt(1+x). But that can't be, because a is a constant, not dependent on x.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the expression. Maybe the wave function is zero outside the interval [1,3], but the given wave function is non-zero only in that region. So perhaps the given wave function ψ(x) is defined only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i.

Hmm, maybe the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 +x)) for 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero otherwise. But the given wave function has this minus 0.5i part, which suggests it's a complex function. But if ψ(x)=0 outside 1 and 3, then in that region, (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i must be zero. So a/sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i. But sqrt(1+x) is real, so a must be 0.5i multiplied by sqrt(1+x). But a is a constant, so that can't be. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the wave function as given is correct only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So inside the interval, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i, and outside it's zero. But that would mean that the modulus squared is |a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i|^2 which is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. But that doesn't depend on x for the imaginary part. Hmm, but that would mean the wave function's modulus squared is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25. But the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 should be 1, because the wave function must be normalized.

Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, then the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 from -infinity to infinity is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx. So |ψ(x)|^2 is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms would involve real and imaginary parts. Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. The modulus squared is ψ(x)*ψ(x)* = [a / sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply out, the cross terms cancel. So |ψ(x)|^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

So let's set up the integral:

Integral (from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two terms:

a² * Integral (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

Compute each part.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second term is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So overall:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ approximately 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since the problem states that particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this interval. Therefore, the normalization integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two terms:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

1. Compute the first integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

2. Compute the second integral:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
