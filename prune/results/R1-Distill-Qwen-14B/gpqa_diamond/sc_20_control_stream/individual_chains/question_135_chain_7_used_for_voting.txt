Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I remember that bosons are force-carrying particles, like photons or W and Z bosons. The question gives me a Lagrangian, which is the mathematical description of the interaction between the boson X and some fermions.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a typo or maybe a notation issue. Oh, wait, probably it's L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but maybe I'm misreading it. Alternatively, maybe it's something like L = -λ ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but that doesn't quite make sense dimensionally. Oh wait, perhaps it's L = -λ X(y) ψ_f(y) ψ_f(y), which would make more sense because X is a boson field, and the ψ's are fermion fields. So maybe X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, the correct form for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = - g ψ ψ X, where g is a coupling constant. So in this case, maybe the interaction term is λ X ψ_f ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but perhaps the exact form isn't critical for this problem; maybe I just need to focus on the masses and allowed decays.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to determine which fermion pairs the X can decay into. Remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the fermion mass must be less than half of the boson's mass because each fermion would carry away some energy, and the rest mass must be provided.

Wait, because for a boson X with mass M, the fermion pair's combined rest mass must be less than M. But wait, no, because the fermions are produced as a pair, so each has mass m. So the condition is 2m < M, because each fermion has mass m, so together they need 2m to be at rest. So M must be greater than 2m for the decay to be possible.

So the boson X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must have mass less than 3 GeV.

What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. 

The charged leptons: electrons are about 0.511 MeV, negligible. Muons are about 105.7 MeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. 

The quarks: up and down are light, around 2-5 MeV (but their masses are a bit model-dependent, but for the sake of this problem, maybe take them as about 3 MeV each). Then, the strange quark is about 95-100 MeV. The charm quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5-5 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me get the approximate masses right.

Electron: ~0.5 MeV
Muon: ~105.7 MeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
Up: ~2 MeV
Down: ~5 MeV
Strange: ~95 MeV
Charm: ~1.25 GeV
Bottom: ~4.7 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV (way too heavy, so X can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_top would be 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV)

So for each fermion pair, the maximum mass per fermion is 3 GeV.

So check each option:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, bottom quark mass is ~4.7 GeV. So 2*m_b is about 9.4 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is out.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Charm quark: m_c ~1.25 GeV. 2*m_c = ~2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed.

Tau: m_tau ~1.78 GeV, 2*m_tau ~3.56 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV? No, wait, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so tau is allowed.

Wait, wait 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than X's 6 GeV, so decay into tau+tau- is possible.

Muons: m_mu ~0.105 GeV, 2*0.105 = 0.21 GeV, so allowed.

Electrons: negligible, allowed.

So option B includes c cbar, which is allowed because 2*1.25 is 2.5 <6.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But top quark mass is about 173 GeV. 2*m_t is 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV, so t tbar is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But as before, b quark is too heavy. So D includes b bbar which is not allowed.

So looking back, the allowed fermions are those with m < 3 GeV.

Charm quark: m=1.25 GeV → allowed, as 2*1.25=2.5 <6.

Bottom quark: m=4.7 → 9.4 >6 → not allowed.

Tau: 1.78 → 3.56 <6 → allowed.

So the possible decay channels are into pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

So which options have that?

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar (s is 95 MeV, 2*0.095=0.19 <6), u and d quarks (masses way below), tau, mu, e.

Wait, does X decay into tau pairs? Because 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV <6 GeV, so yes.

So option B includes c cbar and tau+ tau-, which are allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if the coupling is allowed. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the coupling is to a Dirac fermion ψ_f, so X can couple to ψ_f ψ_f, which would be a fermion-antifermion pair. So the possible decay products are pairs of that fermion. So, for example, if ψ_f is a quark flavor, then X can decay into quark and antiquark.

Which fermions are included in the interaction? The problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions." So perhaps X can decay into any of the fermion pairs listed in the options.

But the boson's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV.

So looking at the options:

Option A includes bbar b, which is 4.7 GeV each → 9.4 total, which is more than 6. So that's not allowed. So A is out.

Option B includes c cbar (each 1.25 GeV → 2.5), which is allowed. Also tau+ tau- (each 1.78 → 3.56 GeV). So allowed. Also, mu and e.

Option B seems correct.

Option C includes t tbar, which is not allowed, so no.

Option D includes bbar b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian, and the allowed decays depend on the fermion masses. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the combined rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than the boson's mass. This means \( 2m_f < M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the fermions are approximately:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded due to extremely high mass)

Using the condition \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the allowed fermion pairs are:
- \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 2.5 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)

The decays \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
