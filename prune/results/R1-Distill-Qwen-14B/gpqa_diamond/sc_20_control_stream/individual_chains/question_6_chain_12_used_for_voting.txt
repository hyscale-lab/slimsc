Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a particle in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a particle is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For a two-dimensional problem, especially in polar coordinates, the kinetic part involves the angular momentum and the radial part. So the total Hamiltonian should be H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ).

Wait, but wait, the potential looks a bit complicated. Let me break it down. It's 1/2 k r² plus 3/2 k r² cos²θ. So that's like a harmonic oscillator term in r, and another term that depends on the angle. Hmm, perhaps this potential can be rewritten in a way that separates the variables or resembles known potentials.

I think I remember that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a central potential (which depends only on r) would separate into radial and angular parts. But here the potential depends on both r and θ, which complicates things. Maybe I can rewrite the potential to see if it's expressible in terms of some effective potential.

Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) k r². Hmm, 3/2 cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Since cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, substituting that in, 3/2 * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)(1 + cos2θ). So the potential becomes V = [1/2 + (3/4)(1 + cos2θ)] k r². Let's compute that: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 = 5/4, and then plus 3/4 cos2θ. So V = [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ] k r².

Wait, that looks like it's combining a central term and a term oscillating in θ with a frequency of 2θ. That makes me think about effective potentials and perhaps a shift in the angular part.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider this problem in terms of the effective potential by looking for separability. Another approach is to think about the potential V(r,θ) and see if it can be rewritten as the sum of two terms, each depending on either r or θ, but I don't think that's straightforward here.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of a perturbed harmonic oscillator. The first term (1/2 k r²) is a standard 2D harmonic oscillator potential. The second term (3/2 k r² cos²θ) could be a perturbation. Wait, but in two dimensions, the harmonic oscillator is usually separable, which may not be the case here due to the cos²θ term. So maybe I should try to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in terms of angular momentum or other operators.

Another idea: in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates has terms involving L² (the angular part) and r terms. The potential here depends on cos²θ, which is related to L_z, the angular momentum in the z-direction. Because cosθ relates to the angle, and L_z is proportional to r^2 times the derivative with respect to θ. Hmm, but how would that tie into the potential?

Wait, perhaps I can find an effective angular part. Let's see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2 k r²) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, no, the expression I had earlier was V = [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ] k r². Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos2θ)/2. So the potential V(r,θ) can be written as (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r²) ( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ). Let me compute that: (3/2)(1/2) = 3/4. So the second term becomes 3/4 k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential is (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = [1/2 + 3/4] kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Calculating 1/2 + 3/4: 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4. So V = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but how does that help me? Well, the potential includes a term with cos2θ, which is a function of the angle. That might suggest that the potential has a periodicity of π instead of 2π, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of the angular momentum. L^2 is related to the angular part of the Hamiltonian. The angular part for the central potential is (ħ² l (l+1))/(2m r²), but I don't see that here. Alternatively, maybe there's a shift in the angular momentum due to the cos2θ term.

Alternatively, I can think about this as a perturbation. The original potential without the cos²θ term would be a 2D harmonic oscillator. The additional term perturbs it. But wait, I don't think that's the case because the perturbation here is not small, so perturbation theory might not apply.

Wait another approach: perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of terms involving r^2 and cos2θ. Maybe we can make a coordinate transformation to simplify it. Let me think about the angular part. The presence of cos2θ suggests that perhaps we can shift the angle by something. Alternatively, maybe consider a shift in the angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps we can express the potential in terms of the angular momentum operator. Because L_z is proportional to r² ∂/∂θ, which involves terms with cosθ and sinθ. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Wait, another thought: in the case of a central potential, the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). The p_θ² term is (ħ² l²)/(2m r²), where l is the angular momentum quantum number. But in this problem, the potential depends on θ, so this complicates things because the potential itself is not central (i.e., it's not spherically symmetric).

Hmm, perhaps the potential can be rewritten to separate the r and θ dependence in a way that allows the Hamiltonian to be expressed as a sum of operators for each variable.

Wait, looking back, the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = (k r²) [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ].

The [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ] term can be rewritten. Let's compute this: 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2.

But 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So 3 cos²θ = (3/2)(1 + cos2θ). Plugging that in: 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

Wait, not exactly. Let me do the math again. 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) = 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So putting it back, V(r,θ) = (k r²) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression was [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ] = [ (1 + 3 cos²θ) ] / 2.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the steps. Let me compute 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ.

1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2.

Expressing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, so:

= [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ] / 2.

= [ (2 + 3(1 + cos2θ)) ] / (4).

= [2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ ] /4.

= (5 + 3 cos2θ)/4.

So V(r,θ) = (k r²) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/4.

Hmm, that gives me V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, I'm not sure if that's helpful, but let's think about how this potential affects the Hamiltonian.

The total Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (5/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Now, the kinetic part is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). The potential includes a term that's a function of r and another that's a function of cos2θ.

Wait, but perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of angular momentum. Because p_θ is related to L_z, which is ħ (d/dθ). So p_θ² is proportional to L_z².

Wait, but the potential has a cos2θ term. Let me think about that. There's an identity that relates cos2θ to L_z. Let me think: L_z = -iħ r (d/dθ), so L_z^2 = -ħ² r² (d²/dθ²). Hmm, but how does that relate to cos2θ? Alternatively, perhaps the term cos2θ can be expressed in terms of L_z.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the identity cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) /2. So the potential term (3/4)k r² cos2θ can be written as (3/8)k r² (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider a shift in the angular momentum operator. For example, perhaps we can make a substitution that shifts the angular part so that the Hamiltonian becomes separable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian by considering a shift in the angular momentum operator. Let me think about this.

The potential term in θ is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Let me write cos2θ as (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2. So the term becomes (3k r²)/(8) (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

But the angular momentum operator is L_z = ħ (d/dθ), so perhaps this term can be expressed in terms of L_z.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a function of L_z^2. Wait, L_z is an operator proportional to e^{iθ} (in some representation), so L_z^2 would involve e^{i2θ}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the term cos2θ can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum. Let me think: cos2θ = ( (L_z^2) )/( r² ħ^2 ) )? No, wait, because L_z = ħ r (d/dθ), so L_z^2 = ħ² r² (d²/dθ²) + ... Wait, but d²/dθ² of cos2θ is -4 cos2θ. Hmm, perhaps there's a relation.

Wait, d²/dθ² (cos2θ) = -4 cos2θ. So, L_z^2 is proportional to the second derivative. Let's see: L_z^2 = ħ² r² (d²/dθ²) + ... Wait, no, more precisely, L_z^2 = -ħ² r² (d²/dθ² + cotθ d/dθ ). Hmm, that's more complicated. I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Wait, maybe I should consider the Hamiltonian in terms of operators. The kinetic part is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Hmm, perhaps I can group the terms involving cos2θ. Let me think about the angular part of the Hamiltonian. The angular part is (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Wait, p_θ is equal to L_z / r. So p_θ² = L_z² / r². So the angular part becomes (L_z²)/(2m r^4) + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but that might not be helpful. Another approach: perhaps the potential can be written as a function of cos2θ, which might suggest that the energy levels depend on some combination of the angular quantum number and some radial quantum number.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written as an effective potential in terms of an angular momentum shift. Because the presence of the cos2θ term in the potential might suggest that the angular momentum is effectively modified.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a shift in the angular momentum. Let me imagine that the potential can be expressed as a function that includes L_z squared. Let me write cos2θ as (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) /2, as before. Then, the term involving cos2θ in the potential would introduce terms proportional to e^{i2θ} and e^{-i2θ}.

Wait, but the kinetic term has L_z^2, which is proportional to e^{i2θ} times something. Wait, perhaps I can find a way to rewrite the Hamiltonian such that the term with cos2θ combines with the kinetic term.

Wait, let me try to think about an effective angular momentum. Perhaps the presence of the cos2θ term in the potential can be absorbed by shifting the angular momentum operator by a certain amount. Let's consider that.

Let me suppose that the potential can be written as H = H_0 + V', where H_0 is the harmonic oscillator part, and V' is the perturbation. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted angular momentum. Let me think: if I have a term like (3/4)k r² cos2θ, perhaps I can write this as (3/4)k r² ( (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2 ). Which is (3k r²)/(8) (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

But then, the kinetic term is (L_z^2)/(2m r²) + (5/4)k r². Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can combine the terms involving cos2θ and the kinetic term. Let me consider the angular part of the Hamiltonian, which is (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2) + (3/4)k r^2 cos2θ. Hmm.

Wait, let's think of the angular part as H_θ = (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2) + (3/4)k r^2 cos2θ. Let me make a substitution for the angular momentum. Let me define a new angular momentum operator, say, L'_z = L_z + something, so that H_θ can be expressed in terms of L'_z^2.

Wait, because when you have H_θ involving cos2θ and L_z^2, perhaps you can shift L_z to include some multiple of cos2θ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to change variables. Let me consider a substitution where I define a new angle, say φ = 2θ. Then, cos2θ becomes cosφ. But then, in terms of φ, the angular momentum would be different. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of an effective angular momentum. Let me think about it more carefully.

The angular part of the potential is (3/4)k r^2 cos2θ. Let me write this as (3/4)k r^2 [ (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) /2 ] = (3k r^2)/(8) [e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ].

Now, the kinetic term in the angular direction is (L_z^2)/(2m r^2). Let me write L_z = ħ (d/dθ) → L_z = ħ (d/dφ) * (dφ/dθ). But φ=2θ → dφ/dθ=2, so L_z = ħ * 2 (d/dφ). So L_z^2 = 4 ħ^2 (d/dφ)^2.

But perhaps for the purpose of substitution, I can define a new angular momentum operator that includes a shift due to the potential.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the problem in a rotated frame or with a shifted angle. Let me think: if I make a substitution where φ = θ + α, perhaps the potential can be diagonalized more easily. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me step back and think about the possible energy levels.

In a 2D harmonic oscillator without any angular dependence, the energy spectrum is E = (n_x + n_y +1 ) ħ ω, where ω= sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y are non-negative integers. Or perhaps another way, depending on how it's written.

But in our case, the potential is not spherically symmetric. It has an angular component. So the energy levels will depend on both the radial quantum numbers and the angular quantum numbers.

Looking at the options, each has a term with n_x and n_y and a combination of coefficients, multiplied by ħ sqrt(k/m). So perhaps the energy is a linear combination of these quantum numbers.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a sum of two harmonic oscillators in different directions.

Wait, let me think: in two dimensions, sometimes potentials can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me try to write the potential in Cartesian coordinates to see if it becomes a sum of harmonic oscillators.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So the potential is V(r,θ)= ½ k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Let me expand cos²θ in terms of x and y. cosθ = x/(r). So cos²θ = x²/(r²).

So V= (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²)/(r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But r² is x² + y². So substituting that in:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) ) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y² ) + (3/2 k x² ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² ) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! Wait a minute, this is interesting. So the potential can be rewritten as V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So that's a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, but with different spring constants. So the potential is separable into x and y terms.

Wait, so this means that the problem is actually a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. So the energy levels should be the sum of the energies from each direction.

In that case, the energy would be E = E_x + E_y, where E_x is the energy for the x-direction oscillator and E_y for the y-direction.

In the x-direction, the potential is (2k) x², so the angular frequency ω_x = sqrt(2k/m). The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...).

Similarly, the y-direction potential is (1/2 k) y², so ω_y = sqrt( (1/2 k)/m ) = (1/√2) * sqrt(k/m).

So the energy for each direction is:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m )

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt( (1/2 k)/m ) = (n_y + 1/2) ħ (1/√2) sqrt(k/m )

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to combine these into a single expression. Let me write the total energy:

E = E_x + E_y = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt( (k/m) / 2 )

Hmm, but the options given are all in terms of sqrt(k/m), so let's factor that out.

sqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m)
sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m )

So:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] ħ sqrt(k/m )

Hmm, but the options don't have this form. Let me compute what this would be.

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) ) + (n_y + 1/2) / sqrt(2) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me multiply and divide terms to have a common denominator.

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [ (2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, and 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707. So perhaps I can express E in terms of a linear combination of sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2) multiplied by (n_x +1/2) and (n_y +1/2), respectively.

But looking at the options, none of them have this form. The options have combinations of n_x and n_y multiplied by integers, like option B is (n_x +3 n_y +3/2). So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier approach.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation when expanding the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Let me check that again.

Wait, I had V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Then, expanding in x and y:

r² = x² + y².

cos²θ = (x²)/(r²).

So V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x²).

= (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y² + 3/2 k x² )

= ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² )

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Yes, that's correct.

So the potential is indeed separable into x and y terms with different coefficients.

So the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x is the harmonic oscillator in x with potential 2k x², and H_y is the harmonic oscillator in y with potential (1/2)k y².

Thus, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y.

Each energy level for a harmonic oscillator is E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m) for that direction.

Wait, but the x-direction has a potential 2k x², so ω_x = sqrt(2k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction has (1/2) k y², so ω_y = sqrt( ( (1/2)k )/m ) = sqrt( k/(2m) ) = (1/√2) sqrt(k/m).

So E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m )

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ (1/√2) sqrt(k/m )

So the total energy is E = (n_x +1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m ) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ (1/√2) sqrt(k/m )

Factor out sqrt(k/m) and ħ:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x +1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y +1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Hmm, but the options don't show this. Let's compute the coefficients.

sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, and 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707.

But perhaps I can factor these into the expression. Let me write sqrt(2) as 2^{1/2}, and 1/sqrt(2) as 2^{-1/2}.

So:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) 2^{1/2} + (n_y + 1/2) 2^{-1/2} ) ]

Let me factor out 2^{-1/2}:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) * 2^{-1/2} [ (n_x +1/2) 2^{1} + (n_y +1/2) 1 ) ]

Which is:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ) ]

= ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) * [ (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ) ] / sqrt(2)

= ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) * ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) / sqrt(2 )

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute the numerator:

2(n_x +1/2) = 2n_x +1.

(n_y +1/2) = n_y +1/2.

Adding those gives 2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

So the numerator is 2n_x +n_y +3/2.

So E = ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) * (2n_x +n_y +3/2 ) / sqrt(2 )

Hmm, but none of the options have a division by sqrt(2). Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m )

Ah, but my expression has an extra 1/sqrt(2) factor. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when considering the relationship between the potential and the frequency.

Wait, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x².

In our case, for the x-direction:

V_x = 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Wait, wait a minute. Oh! I think I made a mistake in calculating ω_x earlier.

Let me correct this. The potential is V_x = 2k x². Comparing to the standard harmonic oscillator potential (1/2) m ω² x², so 1/2 m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Similarly, for the y-direction potential: V_y = (1/2)k y². So 1/2 m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I had mistakenly written ω_x as sqrt(2k/m), but it's actually 2 sqrt(k/m).

So let me redo the energy calculations with the correct ω.

E_x = (n_x +1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x +1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) )

E_y = (n_y +1/2) ħ ω_y = (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

So the total energy is:

E = 2(n_x +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )

= [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

= [ 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

= (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Which matches option C: E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m )

So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \). Using \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]
   This shows that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \).

2. **Energy Levels for Each Oscillator**:  
   The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:
   \[
   E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
   \]
   where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) is the angular frequency.  
   - For the \( x \)-direction oscillator with potential \( 2kx^2 \), the angular frequency is \( \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction oscillator with potential \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the angular frequency is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the energies from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-direction oscillators:
   \[

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, a particle in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a particle is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For a two-dimensional problem, especially in polar coordinates, the kinetic part involves the angular momentum and the radial part. So the total Hamiltonian should be H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ).

Wait, but wait, the potential looks a bit complicated. Let me break it down. It's 1/2 k r² plus 3/2 k r² cos²θ. So that's like a harmonic oscillator term in r, and another term that depends on the angle. Hmm, perhaps this potential can be rewritten in a way that separates the variables or resembles known potentials.

I think I remember that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a central potential (which depends only on r) would separate into radial and angular parts. But here the potential depends on both r and θ, which complicates things. Maybe I can rewrite the potential to see if it's expressible in terms of some effective potential.

Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) k r². Hmm, 3/2 cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Since cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, substituting that in, 3/2 * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)(1 + cos2θ). So the potential becomes V = [1/2 + (3/4)(1 + cos2θ)] k r². Let's compute that: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 = 5/4, and then plus 3/4 cos2θ. So V = [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ] k r².

Wait, that looks like it's combining a central term and a term oscillating in θ with a frequency of 2θ. That makes me think about effective potentials and perhaps a shift in the angular part.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider this problem in terms of the effective potential by looking for separability. Another approach is to think about the potential V(r,θ) and see if it can be rewritten as the sum of two terms, each depending on either r or θ, but I don't think that's straightforward here.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of a perturbed harmonic oscillator. The first term (1/2 k r²) is a standard 2D harmonic oscillator potential. The second term (3/2 k r² cos²θ) could be a perturbation. Wait, but in two dimensions, the harmonic oscillator is usually separable, which may not be the case here due to the cos²θ term. So maybe I should try to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in terms of angular momentum or other operators.

Another idea: in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates has terms involving L² (the angular part) and r terms. The potential here depends on cos²θ, which is related to L_z, the angular momentum in the z-direction. Because cosθ relates to the angle, and L_z is proportional to r^2 times the derivative with respect to θ. Hmm, but how would that tie into the potential?

Wait, perhaps I can find an effective angular part. Let's see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2 k r²) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, no, the expression I had earlier was V = [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ] k r². Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos2θ)/2. So the potential V(r,θ) can be written as (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r²) ( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ). Let me compute that: (3/2)(1/2) = 3/4. So the second term becomes 3/4 k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential is (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = [1/2 + 3/4] kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Calculating 1/2 + 3/4: 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4. So V = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but how does that help me? Well, the potential includes a term with cos2θ, which is a function of the angle. That might suggest that the potential has a periodicity of π instead of 2π, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of the angular momentum. L^2 is related to the angular part of the Hamiltonian. The angular part for the central potential is (ħ² l (l+1))/(2m r²), but I don't see that here. Alternatively, maybe there's a shift in the angular momentum due to the cos2θ term.

Alternatively, I can think about this as a perturbation. The original potential without the cos²θ term would be a 2D harmonic oscillator. The additional term perturbs it. But wait, I don't think that's the case because the perturbation here is not small, so perturbation theory might not apply.

Wait another approach: perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of terms involving r^2 and cos2θ. Maybe we can make a coordinate transformation to simplify it. Let me think about the angular part. The presence of cos2θ suggests that perhaps we can shift the angle by something. Alternatively, maybe consider a shift in the angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps we can express the potential in terms of the angular momentum operator. Because L_z is proportional to r² ∂/∂θ, which involves terms with cosθ and sinθ. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Wait, another thought: in the case of a central potential, the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). The p_θ² term is (ħ² l²)/(2m r²), where l is the angular momentum quantum number. But in this problem, the potential depends on θ, so this complicates things because the potential itself is not central (i.e., it's not spherically symmetric).

Hmm, perhaps the potential can be rewritten to separate the r and θ dependence in a way that allows the Hamiltonian to be expressed as a sum of operators for each variable.

Wait, looking back, the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = (k r²) [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ].

The [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ] term can be rewritten. Let's compute this: 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2.

But 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So 3 cos²θ = (3/2)(1 + cos2θ). Plugging that in: 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

Wait, not exactly. Let me do the math again. 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) = 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So putting it back, V(r,θ) = (k r²) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression was [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ] = [ (1 + 3 cos²θ) ] / 2.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the steps. Let me compute 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ.

1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2.

Expressing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, so:

= [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ] / 2.

= [ (2 + 3(1 + cos2θ)) ] / (4).

= [2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ ] /4.

= (5 + 3 cos2θ)/4.

So V(r,θ) = (k r²) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/4.

Hmm, that gives me V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, I'm not sure if that's helpful, but let's think about how this potential affects the Hamiltonian.

The total Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (5/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Now, the kinetic part is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). The potential includes a term that's a function of r and another that's a function of cos2θ.

Wait, but perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of angular momentum. Because p_θ is related to L_z, which is ħ (d/dθ). So p_θ² is proportional to L_z².

Wait, but the potential has a cos2θ term. Let me think about that. There's an identity that relates cos2θ to L_z. Let me think: L_z = -iħ r (d/dθ), so L_z^2 = -ħ² r² (d²/dθ²). Hmm, but how does that relate to cos2θ? Alternatively, perhaps the term cos2θ can be expressed in terms of L_z.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the identity cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) /2. So the potential term (3/4)k r² cos2θ can be written as (3/8)k r² (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider a shift in the angular momentum operator. For example, perhaps we can make a substitution that shifts the angular part so that the Hamiltonian becomes separable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian by considering a shift in the angular momentum operator. Let me think about this.

The potential term in θ is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Let me write cos2θ as (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2. So the term becomes (3k r²)/(8) (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

But the angular momentum operator is L_z = ħ (d/dθ), so perhaps this term can be expressed in terms of L_z.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a function of L_z^2. Wait, L_z is an operator proportional to e^{iθ} (in some representation), so L_z^2 would involve e^{i2θ}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the term cos2θ can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum. Let me think: cos2θ = ( (L_z^2) )/( r² ħ^2 ) )? No, wait, because L_z = ħ r (d/dθ), so L_z^2 = ħ² r² (d²/dθ²) + ... Wait, but d²/dθ² of cos2θ is -4 cos2θ. Hmm, perhaps there's a relation.

Wait, d²/dθ² (cos2θ) = -4 cos2θ. So, L_z^2 is proportional to the second derivative. Let's see: L_z^2 = ħ² r² (d²/dθ²) + ... Wait, no, more precisely, L_z^2 = -ħ² r² (d²/dθ² + cotθ d/dθ ). Hmm, that's more complicated. I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Wait, maybe I should consider the Hamiltonian in terms of operators. The kinetic part is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Hmm, perhaps I can group the terms involving cos2θ. Let me think about the angular part of the Hamiltonian. The angular part is (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Wait, p_θ is equal to L_z / r. So p_θ² = L_z² / r². So the angular part becomes (L_z²)/(2m r^4) + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but that might not be helpful. Another approach: perhaps the potential can be written as a function of cos2θ, which might suggest that the energy levels depend on some combination of the angular quantum number and some radial quantum number.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written as an effective potential in terms of an angular momentum shift. Because the presence of the cos2θ term in the potential might suggest that the angular momentum is effectively modified.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a shift in the angular momentum. Let me imagine that the potential can be expressed as a function that includes L_z squared. Let me write cos2θ as (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) /2, as before. Then, the term involving cos2θ in the potential would introduce terms proportional to e^{i2θ} and e^{-i2θ}.

Wait, but the kinetic term has L_z^2, which is proportional to e^{i2θ} times something. Wait, perhaps I can find a way to rewrite the Hamiltonian such that the term with cos2θ combines with the kinetic term.

Wait, let me try to think about an effective angular momentum. Perhaps the presence of the cos2θ term in the potential can be absorbed by shifting the angular momentum operator by a certain amount. Let's consider that.

Let me suppose that the potential can be written as H = H_0 + V', where H_0 is the harmonic oscillator part, and V' is the perturbation. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted angular momentum. Let me think: if I have a term like (3/4)k r² cos2θ, perhaps I can write this as (3/4)k r² ( (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2 ). Which is (3k r²)/(8) (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}).

But then, the kinetic term is (L_z^2)/(2m r²) + (5/4)k r². Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can combine the terms involving cos2θ and the kinetic term. Let me consider the angular part of the Hamiltonian, which is (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2) + (3/4)k r^2 cos2θ. Hmm.

Wait, let's think of the angular part as H_θ = (p_θ^2)/(2m r^2) + (3/4)k r^2 cos2θ. Let me make a substitution for the angular momentum. Let me define a new angular momentum operator, say, L'_z = L_z + something, so that H_θ can be expressed in terms of L'_z^2.

Wait, because when you have H_θ involving cos2θ and L_z^2, perhaps you can shift L_z to include some multiple of cos2θ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to change variables. Let me consider a substitution where I define a new angle, say φ = 2θ. Then, cos2θ becomes cosφ. But then, in terms of φ, the angular momentum would be different. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of an effective angular momentum. Let me think about it more carefully.

The angular part of the potential is (3/4)k r^2 cos2θ. Let me write this as (3/4)k r^2 [ (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) /2 ] = (3k r^2)/(8) [e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} ].

Now, the kinetic term in the angular direction is (L_z^2)/(2m r^2). Let me write L_z = ħ (d/dθ) → L_z = ħ (d/dφ) * (dφ/dθ). But φ=2θ → dφ/dθ=2, so L_z = ħ * 2 (d/dφ). So L_z^2 = 4 ħ^2 (d/dφ)^2.

But perhaps for the purpose of substitution, I can define a new angular momentum operator that includes a shift due to the potential.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the problem in a rotated frame or with a shifted angle. Let me think: if I make a substitution where φ = θ + α, perhaps the potential can be diagonalized more easily. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me step back and think about the possible energy levels.

In a 2D harmonic oscillator without any angular dependence, the energy spectrum is E = (n_x + n_y +1 ) ħ ω, where ω= sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y are non-negative integers. Or perhaps another way, depending on how it's written.

But in our case, the potential is not spherically symmetric. It has an angular component. So the energy levels will depend on both the radial quantum numbers and the angular quantum numbers.

Looking at the options, each has a term with n_x and n_y and a combination of coefficients, multiplied by ħ sqrt(k/m). So perhaps the energy is a linear combination of these quantum numbers.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a sum of two harmonic oscillators in different directions.

Wait, let me think: in two dimensions, sometimes potentials can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me try to write the potential in Cartesian coordinates to see if it becomes a sum of harmonic oscillators.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So the potential is V(r,θ)= ½ k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Let me expand cos²θ in terms of x and y. cosθ = x/(r). So cos²θ = x²/(r²).

So V= (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²)/(r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But r² is x² + y². So substituting that in:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) ) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y² ) + (3/2 k x² ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² ) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! Wait a minute, this is interesting. So the potential can be rewritten as V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So that's a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, but with different spring constants. So the potential is separable into x and y terms.

Wait, so this means that the problem is actually a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. So the energy levels should be the sum of the energies from each direction.

In that case, the energy would be E = E_x + E_y, where E_x is the energy for the x-direction oscillator and E_y for the y-direction.

In the x-direction, the potential is (2k) x², so the angular frequency ω_x = sqrt(2k/m). The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...).

Similarly, the y-direction potential is (1/2 k) y², so ω_y = sqrt( (1/2 k)/m ) = (1/√2) * sqrt(k/m).

So the energy for each direction is:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m )

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt( (1/2 k)/m ) = (n_y + 1/2) ħ (1/√2) sqrt(k/m )

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to combine these into a single expression. Let me write the total energy:

E = E_x + E_y = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt( (k/m) / 2 )

Hmm, but the options given are all in terms of sqrt(k/m), so let's factor that out.

sqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m)
sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m )

So:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] ħ sqrt(k/m )

Hmm, but the options don't have this form. Let me compute what this would be.

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) ) + (n_y + 1/2) / sqrt(2) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me multiply and divide terms to have a common denominator.

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [ (2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, and 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707. So perhaps I can express E in terms of a linear combination of sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2) multiplied by (n_x +1/2) and (n_y +1/2), respectively.

But looking at the options, none of them have this form. The options have combinations of n_x and n_y multiplied by integers, like option B is (n_x +3 n_y +3/2). So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier approach.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation when expanding the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Let me check that again.

Wait, I had V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Then, expanding in x and y:

r² = x² + y².

cos²θ = (x²)/(r²).

So V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x²).

= (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y² + 3/2 k x² )

= ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² )

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Yes, that's correct.

So the potential is indeed separable into x and y terms with different coefficients.

So the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x is the harmonic oscillator in x with potential 2k x², and H_y is the harmonic oscillator in y with potential (1/2)k y².

Thus, the total energy is E = E_x + E_y.

Each energy level for a harmonic oscillator is E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m) for that direction.

Wait, but the x-direction has a potential 2k x², so ω_x = sqrt(2k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction has (1/2) k y², so ω_y = sqrt( ( (1/2)k )/m ) = sqrt( k/(2m) ) = (1/√2) sqrt(k/m).

So E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m )

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ (1/√2) sqrt(k/m )

So the total energy is E = (n_x +1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m ) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ (1/√2) sqrt(k/m )

Factor out sqrt(k/m) and ħ:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x +1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y +1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Hmm, but the options don't show this. Let's compute the coefficients.

sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, and 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707.

But perhaps I can factor these into the expression. Let me write sqrt(2) as 2^{1/2}, and 1/sqrt(2) as 2^{-1/2}.

So:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) 2^{1/2} + (n_y + 1/2) 2^{-1/2} ) ]

Let me factor out 2^{-1/2}:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) * 2^{-1/2} [ (n_x +1/2) 2^{1} + (n_y +1/2) 1 ) ]

Which is:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ) ]

= ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) * [ (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ) ] / sqrt(2)

= ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) * ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) / sqrt(2 )

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute the numerator:

2(n_x +1/2) = 2n_x +1.

(n_y +1/2) = n_y +1/2.

Adding those gives 2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

So the numerator is 2n_x +n_y +3/2.

So E = ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) * (2n_x +n_y +3/2 ) / sqrt(2 )

Hmm, but none of the options have a division by sqrt(2). Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m )

Ah, but my expression has an extra 1/sqrt(2) factor. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when considering the relationship between the potential and the frequency.

Wait, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x².

In our case, for the x-direction:

V_x = 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Wait, wait a minute. Oh! I think I made a mistake in calculating ω_x earlier.

Let me correct this. The potential is V_x = 2k x². Comparing to the standard harmonic oscillator potential (1/2) m ω² x², so 1/2 m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Similarly, for the y-direction potential: V_y = (1/2)k y². So 1/2 m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I had mistakenly written ω_x as sqrt(2k/m), but it's actually 2 sqrt(k/m).

So let me redo the energy calculations with the correct ω.

E_x = (n_x +1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x +1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) )

E_y = (n_y +1/2) ħ ω_y = (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

So the total energy is:

E = 2(n_x +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )

= [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

= [ 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ sqrt(k/m )

= (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) * ħ sqrt(k/m )

Which matches option C: E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m )

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \). Using \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]
   This shows that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with spring constant \( 2k \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with spring constant \( \frac{1}{2}k \).

2. **Energy Levels for Each Oscillator**:  
   The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:
   \[
   E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
   \]
   where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) is the angular frequency.  
   - For the \( x \)-direction oscillator with potential \( 2kx^2 \), the angular frequency is \( \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction oscillator with potential \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the angular frequency is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the energies from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-direction oscillators:
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   Combining terms:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, the correct energy spectrum is:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   This matches **Option C**.
