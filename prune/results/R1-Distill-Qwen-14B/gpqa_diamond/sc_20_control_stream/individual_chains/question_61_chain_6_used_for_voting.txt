Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is benzene. The first step is treating it with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are used as a nitrating agent. Benzene undergoes nitration, which typically happens at the para position because of the directing effects. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the nitration will form nitrobenzene, but where is it attached? Actually, for nitration, benzene usually gets a nitro group at the para position, I think. Or wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the first nitration will give a mixture, but since it's a meta director, wait, no—wait, nitration is a meta-directing group? No, nitro is a strong meta director. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the first step, the product is product 1. Benzene reacting with HNO3 and H2SO4 is the nitration. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, but wait, nitrobenzene is meta directing, or para? Wait, no. Benzene is symmetric, so when you nitrate it, the product is nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group at the para position relative to itself. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so when you have a single substituent, the nitration adds para. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Nitration of benzene adds a nitro group. Since nitro is a strong meta-directing group, but that's when it's already present. For the first substitution, the nitro group is added in positions that are ortho, meta, and para, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So the product is a single structure, but wait, no, nitrobenzene can have the nitro group in any position, but since benzene is symmetric, the product is just nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh, that's the bromination reaction. Iron and bromine usually lead to electrophilic substitution. So bromine with Fe as a catalyst is for bromination. Since product 1 has a nitro group, which is a strong meta-directing group, the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, wait. The nitro group is a meta director. So in nitrobenzene, the bromine will enter at the meta position. Let me visualize. The nitro group is at position 1. So the bromine would enter at position 3 or 4? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts with the nitro at position 1. The positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The meta positions are 3 and 5. So the bromine could add in either position. But since nitro is a strong meta director, the major product would be at position 3 or 5, but considering the ring's symmetry, both are equivalent. So product 2 would be 3-bromonitrobenzene. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so it would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene, but I think in the case of two substituents, the numbering might be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as para to the nitro group? Wait, no, nitro is a meta director.

Wait, no, nitration adds a nitro group, then bromination under FeBr2 conditions. So in nitrobenzene, the bromine adds in the meta position relative to the nitro. So the product would have bromine in position 3 and nitro in position 1. But wait, let me think again. Benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group is in position 1, and the bromine can go into position 3 or 5. So product 2 is 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

Moving on, product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's a hydrogenation reaction, probably reducing the nitro group. So the nitro group (NO2) gets reduced to an amino group (NH2). So product 3 would be 1-amino-3-bromobenzene, which is bromoaniline.

Next step: product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. That sounds like a diazotization reaction. Diazonium salt formation. So in an acidic environment (HBF4 is a strong acid), the amine is converted into a diazonium chloride. Since the amino group is on position 1, the diazonium salt would form at position 1. Then, when heated, the diazonium group typically undergoes a reaction. But wait, the next step says product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole. Hmm.

Wait, the step says: product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4. Then product 4 is heated and treated with anisole. Oh, so perhaps product 4 is the diazonium salt, which then undergoes a coupling reaction with anisole (methoxybenzene).

Wait, but let's go step by step. So product 3 is 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. When treated with NaNO2 and HBF4 (which is a source of H+ and BF4-), it will form the diazonium salt. So the amino group (-NH2) becomes -N2+ which is a good leaving group.

Then, when the diazonium salt is heated, it's likely to undergo a coupling reaction. But wait, in this case, after the diazonium is formed, product 4 is then heated and treated with anisole. Wait, the order might matter. Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium is treated with anisole in a coupling reaction.

Wait, but let me think: when you have a diazonium salt, one common reaction is the coupling reaction with an activating group. Anisole has a methoxy group, which is a strong activating (ortho/para-directing) group. So the benzene ring with the diazonium group (product 4) would couple with anisole under certain conditions.

Wait, but perhaps the diazonium salt is in solution, and when treated with anisole, the coupling occurs. Alternatively, maybe the diazonium salt is used in a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the diazonium salt undergoes a coupling reaction, such as in the presence of a copper catalyst. But the problem states that the diazonium is treated with anisole after being heated. Let me think. Heating the diazonium salt in the presence of anisole might lead to a coupling, like a Gattermann reaction or maybe a Ullmann coupling, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when the diazonium salt is heated in a solution with anisole, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But I'm not too certain about that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by a methoxy group. No, but anisole is methoxybenzene. Maybe it's a substitution where the amino group is replaced by an anisole group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by another substituent from anisole. Wait, maybe it's a cross-coupling reaction, like a Suzuki coupling, but I don't think the conditions given here would support that. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring with the diazonium group undergoes a substitution with the anisole's ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible reactions.

The diazonium salt (from product 3) is treated with anisole. Anisole is OMe-substituted benzene. So perhaps the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (which is attached to N2+) is undergoing a coupling reaction with anisole. Coupling reactions typically involve the aromatic rings attaching to each other, replacing the diazonium group.

Wait, another thought: when a diazonium salt is treated with another aromatic compound, especially with activating groups, it can undergo a coupling reaction. For example, in the presence of Cu, the diazonium salt can transfer its aryl group to another aromatic ring. So, in this case, the diazonium group (from product 3) would transfer its aryl group to anisole's ring, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, but product 3 is 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. So the diazonium salt would be 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene. When this reacts with anisole, perhaps it forms a biaryl compound where the benzene ring from the diazonium is connected to the anisole ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by an anisole's ring. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, after the diazonium is formed, the next steps are heating and treating with anisole. Maybe the diazonium group is a leaving group, so perhaps it undergoes a substitution reaction. But in aromatic substitution, the leaving group would typically be in a position where the ring is activated. Wait, but the diazonium group is a strong meta-directing group, so perhaps anisole's ring reacts at a certain position.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by an oxygen nucleophile, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium group is used in a substitution to form a biphenyl structure. Let me think: product 4 is the diazonium salt (1-diazo-3-bromobenzene). Then, when heated, perhaps it loses nitrogen gas, forming a benzene ring with a bromine and a carbon that's a good leaving group? Or maybe undergoes some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by a bond with another benzene ring. Wait, if anisole is present, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium group is a good leaving group, so when treated with anisole, it undergoes a coupling reaction, forming a biphenyl structure. So the anisole's ring would attach to the benzene ring where the diazonium group was.

Wait, but anisole is OMe-substituted. So the product would be a biphenyl with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by an anisole group. That is, the benzene ring (from product 3) would have the amino group replaced by an anisole ring. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows: after the diazonium salt is formed, it's heated, which causes it to lose N2, forming a benzene ring with a positive charge, which could couple with another benzene ring (anisole) in a coupling reaction. So product 4 is the diazonium salt, and when heated, it loses N2 and forms a benzene ring with a positive charge, which then couples with anisole.

Wait, another possibility is that the diazonium salt undergoes a substitution with anisole in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that typically requires activating groups on the aromatic ring to make the substitution feasible. Anisole has a methoxy group, which is activating, so perhaps the benzene ring with the diazonium group can undergo substitution.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each step again, perhaps in a different order.

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene (product 1)
2. Nitrobenzene → bromination (FeBr2) → 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2)
3. Product 2 → hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2) → 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3)
4. Product 3 → diazotization (NaNO2, HBF4) → 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene (product 4)
5. Product 4 → heated, then treated with anisole → ?

So product 4 is the diazonium salt: 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene. Then, when heated, perhaps the diazonium group decomposes. Diazonium salts upon heating (especially in acidic conditions) typically decompose to form a benzene ring with a positive charge (like a benzylium ion), which could then react with a nucleophile or undergo coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is converted into a good leaving group, allowing substitution. But in aromatic substitution, it's not straightforward. Wait, perhaps in the presence of anisole, the diazonium group acts as a leaving group, and the anisole's ring attaches via a coupling reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options to see what the possible structures are.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl → Hmm, fluoro comes from where? I don't see any fluorine in the reagents.

B) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl → Methoxy group in position 2 on the anisole side.

C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl → Methoxy in position 4'.

D) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl → Both substituents on the same ring in position 4 and 4'.

Wait, the starting material is benzene, so all the substituents come from the reactions. So, where could the methoxy come from? Anisole is methoxybenzene, so when it's used in the reaction, perhaps it's transferring the methoxy group.

Wait, but in the last step, product 4 (the diazonium salt) is treated with anisole. So maybe the diazonium group is replaced by the anisole's ring.

Wait, let me think about the reaction between a diazonium salt and anisole. Diazonium salts can undergo various coupling reactions. One possibility is that the diazonium group is a good leaving group, and under certain conditions, it can be replaced by another group. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring with the diazonium group couples with anisole to form a biphenyl.

Ah, here's a thought: when a diazonium salt reacts with another aromatic compound, especially in the presence of a metal catalyst like copper, it can undergo a coupling reaction called the Ullmann coupling or the Friedlander coupling. But in this case, the conditions might not include a metal catalyst, but perhaps the diazonium salt is heated in the presence of anisole.

Alternatively, when the diazonium salt is heated, it can lose N2, forming a benzene ring with a carbocation-like site, which can then react with anisole's ring in a coupling reaction.

So, product 4 is 1-diazo-3-bromo-benzene. Heating this would cause the diazo group to decompose, possibly forming a benzene ring with a positive charge or a good leaving group. Then, when anisole is added, the benzene ring from anisole might couple with the main ring, forming a biphenyl structure.

But where would the substituents go? Let's imagine the main ring (from product 3) has a bromine at position 3 and an amino group at position 1, which was converted to diazo. After decomposition, the main ring has a bromine at position 3 and a position where coupling occurs.

Wait, when the diazonium group is at position 1, and the ring is coupled with anisole, perhaps the coupling occurs at the position where the diazonium was. So, the main ring would lose the diazonium group and form a bond with the anisole ring.

Wait, but anisole is a methoxy-substituted benzene. So, when the coupling occurs, the anisole's ring would attach to the main ring, and the methoxy group would be in a specific position relative to the coupling site.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the anisole's ring attaches at the position where the diazonium group was, and the methoxy group in anisole is in a certain position relative to that.

Wait, perhaps the main ring (from product 3) has the bromine at position 3 and the coupling occurs at position 1 (where the diazonium was). The anisole ring would attach at position 1 of the main ring. But anisole itself is a benzene ring with a methoxy group. So when it couples, the methoxy group's position relative to the coupling site would determine the final structure.

Wait, if the anisole attaches at position 1 of the main ring, then the methoxy group is in position 1 of the anisole's ring. But that's not how the options are presented. Alternatively, perhaps the main ring is still the benzene ring, with substituents, and the anisole's ring is attached to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure forms, with the main ring being the one that had the bromine and the diazonium group, and the anisole's ring is attached at the position where the diazonium was.

Wait, perhaps product 5 is a biphenyl where the main ring has a bromine at position 3 and the other ring (anisole) is attached at position 1. But the anisole's ring has a methoxy group. Where is it located?

Wait, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the anisole's ring attaches to the main ring at the position where the diazonium group was (position 1). So, the main ring now has the bromine at position 3, and the anisole's ring is attached at position 1. The methoxy group in anisole is at position 1 of its own ring, but in the biphenyl structure, that would be the position relative to the main ring.

Wait, but in biphenyl structures, the substituents on each ring are independent. So if the anisole's ring is attached to the main ring at position 1, the methoxy group on the anisole's ring would be at a certain position relative to the point of attachment.

Alternatively, perhaps the anisole's ring is attached in such a way that the methoxy group is in the para position relative to the point of attachment. Wait, but that's assuming the anisole's ring is reoriented, which might not be the case.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. The main ring (from product 3) has a bromine at position 3 and the anisole's ring is attached at position 1. The anisole's ring has a methoxy group at position 1. So, in the biphenyl structure, the main ring has substituents at position 1 (the point of attachment to the anisole ring) and position 3 (bromine). The anisole ring has a methoxy at position 1 of its own ring. So, in the biphenyl, the methoxy would be attached at the position that's adjacent to the main ring.

Wait, maybe it's easier to number the rings. Let's say the main ring is ring A, and the anisole's ring is ring B. The main ring A has a bromine at position 3 and is attached to ring B at position 1. Ring B (anisole) has a methoxy group at position 1 of its own. But in the biphenyl structure, the point of attachment would be between the two rings, so the methoxy is at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 relative to ring A.

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled in the numbering. Let's think differently. The biphenyl product would have two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The main ring (ring A) has substituents at positions 1 and 3: a bromine at 3 and a connection to ring B at 1. Ring B has a methoxy group at position 1 of its own, which is the same as position 1 on ring A. So, in the biphenyl, the methoxy would be in the same position as the connection point, which would be position 1 of ring B, leading to a structure where the substituents are adjacent on ring B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So, the main ring has a bromine at position 3, and the attached ring (ring B) has a methoxy at position 4' (which is the 4 position on ring B). How would that happen?

If the main ring (ring A) has a bromine at position 3 and is attached to ring B at position 1. Then, the methoxy group on ring B is at position 4, which is the para position relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So, in ring B, the methoxy is at position 4, which would be opposite to the point where it's attached to ring A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when anisole (with methoxy at position 1) couples at position 1 of ring A, the methoxy on ring B would be at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 of ring A. But that's the point of attachment, so perhaps the methoxy is at position 4' for the biphenyl structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the methoxy group on ring B ends up at position 4' relative to ring A's position 1.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure. Let's say ring A has substituents at 1 (biphenyl connection) and 3 (Br). Ring B is connected at ring A's 1 position. On ring B, the substituent is OMe at position 4 (relative to the connection point at 1). So, ring B has OMe at position 4, which is the para position to the connection point.

So, the final product would have a Br at position 3 on ring A, and a OMe at position 4 on ring B. So the structure would be 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which corresponds to option C.

Wait, but how does that happen? When product 4 (1-diazo-3-bromo-benzene) is heated and treated with anisole, the diazo group is replaced by the anisole ring. So, the benzene ring from product 4 loses the diazo group and gains a bond to anisole's ring. The position where the diazo was (position 1) becomes the point of attachment for the anisole ring.

Anisole's ring has a methoxy group at position 1 (its own numbering). When it couples to ring A at ring A's position 1, the methoxy on ring B would be at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 of ring A. But in the biphenyl structure, the positions are numbered relative to their own rings. So ring B's position 1 is attached to ring A's position 1. Then, the methoxy on ring B is at position 1, and in the biphenyl, that would be the same as the point of attachment. But that doesn't seem to match the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the coupling mechanism. When a benzene ring (ring A) with a diazonium group at position 1 reacts with anisole (ring B with OMe at position 1), the coupling would occur between ring A's position 1 and ring B's position 1. So, the two rings are connected at their respective position 1, making a 1,1'-biphenyl structure.

But in this case, ring A has a bromine at position 3, and ring B has a methoxy at position 1. So, the biphenyl would be 1,1'-biphenyl with ring A having Br at position 3 and ring B having OMe at position 1. So, the structure would be 3-bromo-1-methoxy-1'-phenyl biphenyl. But none of the options seem to match that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So, if the methoxy is at 4', that's the para position on ring B relative to the point of attachment at 1'. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps during the coupling reaction, the anisole's ring orients such that the methoxy group ends up in a different position relative to the point of attachment. Alternatively, maybe the coupling leads to a meta or para orientation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coupling. Let me think about the actual reaction.

The diazonium salt (on ring A) is at position 1. When it undergoes coupling with anisole (ring B), the coupling occurs at position 1 of both rings. So, ring A's position 1 is bonded to ring B's position 1. Thus, ring B's substituents are positioned relative to this bond.

In anisole, the methoxy is at position 1. So, when ring B becomes attached to ring A at position 1 of ring B, the methoxy is also at position 1 of ring B, which is now the same as position 1 of ring A. So, in the biphenyl, the methoxy would be at position 1' (because it's on ring B), making the structure 1'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. But ring A also has a Br at position 3.

So the structure would be 3-bromo-1'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So the methoxy is at 4' on ring B. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps during the coupling reaction, the substituents on ring B (anisole) are positioned in a way that the methoxy is at the para position relative to the point of attachment. But why would that happen? Anisole is OMe at position 1. When it couples, the point of attachment would be position 1 of ring B, making the methoxy at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 of ring A. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe another approach: after the coupling, the final product is a biphenyl. The main ring (ring A) has a Br at position 3 and is connected to ring B at position 1. Ring B has a methoxy group which, in the biphenyl structure, is at position 4'.

Hmm. How would the methoxy end up at 4'?

Perhaps the coupling leads to some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the methoxy is in the meta position relative to the point of attachment.

Wait, another possibility: the coupling reaction between the diazonium salt and anisole leads to the transfer of the aryl group from the diazonium to the anisole. So, the benzene ring from the diazonium (ring A) becomes attached to the anisole's ring (ring B) at a certain position, leading to the substituents being in specific positions.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium group (ring A) is attached to the anisole's ring (ring B) at a position that's para to the methoxy group. So, ring B would have the methoxy at position 4, and the point of attachment at position 1. Then, the biphenyl would have the Br at position 3 on ring A and the OMe at position 4' on ring B.

So, that would give 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

But why would the coupling occur in such a way that the methoxy is para to the point of attachment?

Wait, perhaps the coupling isn't directly between the two rings but involves some intermediates. Alternatively, maybe the conditions lead to the methoxy group directing the coupling.

Another thought: when the diazonium salt (ring A) is heated with anisole (ring B, OMe at 1), perhaps the OMe group on ring B directs the coupling to a specific position. Anisole's OMe is an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So, in ring B, the coupling would occur at the para position relative to the OMe group.

Wait, but ring B is the one with OMe. If the coupling occurs at the para position relative to OMe, then the point of attachment (where ring A connects) would be at position 4 of ring B. So, ring B would have OMe at position 1 and the connection to ring A at position 4. Then, in the biphenyl, the OMe would be at position 4', and ring A would have the Br at position 3.

So the structure would be ring A with Br at 3 and connected to ring B at position 1 (since the connection is from ring A's position 1 to ring B's position 4). Wait, no, because ring B is being attached to ring A's position 1. So, ring B would be connected at its position 4 to ring A's position 1, leading to the OMe at 1 on ring B.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- After diazotization and heating, the coupling occurs between ring A (from product 3) and ring B (anisole).

- Ring A has Br at position 3 and is connected to ring B at position 1.

- Ring B (anisole) has OMe at position 1 (its own numbering).

- But when ring B is connected to ring A, the OMe would be at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as the point of attachment. So, in the biphenyl structure, the OMe would be at position 1'.

But option C is 4'-methoxy. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the coupling occurs such that the OMe on ring B is at position 4' relative to the point of attachment (position 1'). So, the OMe is at position 4' on ring B.

How would that happen? Maybe due to the directing effects of the OMe group on ring B. Since OMe is an activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So, when the coupling occurs, the point of attachment (from ring A) would be at the para position relative to the OMe on ring B. Therefore, on ring B, OMe is at position 1, and the point of attachment is at position 4. So, in the biphenyl structure, the OMe is at 4' relative to the point of attachment at 1'.

So the final structure would have:

- Ring A: Br at position 3, connected to ring B at position 1.

- Ring B: OMe at position 4', connected to ring A at position 1'.

Thus, the structure is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

So, putting it all together:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Nitrobenzene → bromination → 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

3. Hydrogenation → 1-amino-3-bromobenzene.

4. Diazotization → 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene.

5. Coupling with anisole → 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, leading to a final product after multiple transformations. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration of Benzene**: Benzene reacts with HNO₃ and H₂SO₄, resulting in nitrobenzene (product 1). The nitro group (-NO₂) is introduced at the para position due to the symmetry of benzene.

2. **Bromination of Nitrobenzene**: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br₂ and Fe powder, leading to bromination. The nitro group is a strong meta-director, so bromine is added at the meta position relative to the nitro group, forming 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction of Nitrobenzene**: Product 2 (1-nitro-3-bromobenzene) is subjected to hydrogenation with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. The nitro group (-NO₂) is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), forming 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3).

4. **Diazotization**: Product 3 (1-amino-3-bromobenzene) is treated with NaNO₂ and HBF₄, converting the amino group (-NH₂) into a diazonium group (-N₂⁺). This forms 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene (product 4).

5. **Coupling with Anisole**: Product 4 (1-diazo-3-bromobenzene) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). The diazonium group acts as a leaving group, and a coupling reaction occurs. The diazonium group is replaced by the anisole ring, forming a biphenyl structure. The methoxy group (-OMe) on anisole is directed to the para position relative to the point of attachment due to its activating nature.

### Final Product:
The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**. This structure has:
- A bromine atom at position 3 on the main ring (ring A).
- A methoxy group (-OMe) at position 4' on the anisole ring (ring B), which is para to the point of attachment (position 1').

### Correct Option:
C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is benzene. The first step is treating it with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are used as a nitrating agent. Benzene undergoes nitration, which typically happens at the para position because of the directing effects. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the nitration will form nitrobenzene, but where is it attached? Actually, for nitration, benzene usually gets a nitro group at the para position, I think. Or wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the first nitration will give a mixture, but since it's a meta director, wait, no—wait, nitration is a meta-directing group? No, nitro is a strong meta director. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the first step, the product is product 1. Benzene reacting with HNO3 and H2SO4 is the nitration. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, but wait, nitrobenzene is meta directing, or para? Wait, no. Benzene is symmetric, so when you nitrate it, the product is nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group at the para position relative to itself. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so when you have a single substituent, the nitration adds para. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Nitration of benzene adds a nitro group. Since nitro is a strong meta-directing group, but that's when it's already present. For the first substitution, the nitro group is added in positions that are ortho, meta, and para, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So the product is a single structure, but wait, no, nitrobenzene can have the nitro group in any position, but since benzene is symmetric, the product is just nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh, that's the bromination reaction. Iron and bromine usually lead to electrophilic substitution. So bromine with Fe as a catalyst is for bromination. Since product 1 has a nitro group, which is a strong meta-directing group, the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, wait. The nitro group is a meta director. So in nitrobenzene, the bromine will enter at the meta position. Let me visualize. The nitro group is at position 1. So the bromine would enter at position 3 or 4? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts with the nitro at position 1. The positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The meta positions are 3 and 5. So the bromine could add in either position. But since nitro is a strong meta director, the major product would be at position 3 or 5, but considering the ring's symmetry, both are equivalent. So product 2 would be 3-bromonitrobenzene. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so it would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene, but I think in the case of two substituents, the numbering might be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as para to the nitro group? Wait, no, nitro is a meta director.

Wait, no, nitration adds a nitro group, then bromination under FeBr2 conditions. So in nitrobenzene, the bromine adds in the meta position relative to the nitro. So the product would have bromine in position 3 and nitro in position 1. But wait, let me think again. Benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group is in position 1, and the bromine can go into position 3 or 5. So product 2 is 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

Moving on, product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's a hydrogenation reaction, probably reducing the nitro group. So the nitro group (NO2) gets reduced to an amino group (NH2). So product 3 would be 1-amino-3-bromobenzene, which is bromoaniline.

Next step: product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. That sounds like a diazotization reaction. Diazonium salt formation. So in an acidic environment (HBF4 is a strong acid), the amine is converted into a diazonium chloride. Since the amino group is on position 1, the diazonium salt would form at position 1. Then, when heated, the diazonium group typically undergoes a reaction. But wait, the next step says product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole. Hmm.

Wait, the step says: product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4. Then product 4 is heated and treated with anisole. Oh, so perhaps product 4 is the diazonium salt, which then undergoes a coupling reaction with anisole (methoxybenzene).

Wait, but let's go step by step. So product 3 is 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. When treated with NaNO2 and HBF4 (which is a source of H+ and BF4-), it will form the diazonium salt. So the amino group (-NH2) becomes -N2+ which is a good leaving group.

Then, when the diazonium salt is heated, it's likely to undergo a coupling reaction. But wait, in this case, after the diazonium is formed, product 4 is then heated and treated with anisole. Wait, the order might matter. Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium is treated with anisole in a coupling reaction.

Wait, but let me think: when you have a diazonium salt, one common reaction is the coupling reaction with an activating group. Anisole has a methoxy group, which is a strong activating (ortho/para-directing) group. So the benzene ring with the diazonium group (product 4) would couple with anisole under certain conditions.

Wait, but perhaps the diazonium salt is in solution, and when treated with anisole, the coupling occurs. Alternatively, maybe the diazonium salt is used in a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the diazonium salt undergoes a coupling reaction, such as in the presence of a copper catalyst. But the problem states that the diazonium is treated with anisole after being heated. Let me think. Heating the diazonium salt in the presence of anisole might lead to a coupling, like a Gattermann reaction or maybe a Ullmann coupling, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when the diazonium salt is heated in a solution with anisole, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But I'm not too certain about that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by a methoxy group. No, but anisole is methoxybenzene. Maybe it's a substitution where the amino group is replaced by an anisole group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by another substituent from anisole. Wait, maybe it's a cross-coupling reaction, like a Suzuki coupling, but I don't think the conditions given here would support that. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring with the diazonium group undergoes a substitution with the anisole's ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible reactions.

The diazonium salt (from product 3) is treated with anisole. Anisole is OMe-substituted benzene. So perhaps the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (which is attached to N2+) is undergoing a coupling reaction with anisole. Coupling reactions typically involve the aromatic rings attaching to each other, replacing the diazonium group.

Wait, another thought: when a diazonium salt is treated with another aromatic compound, especially with activating groups, it can undergo a coupling reaction. For example, in the presence of Cu, the diazonium salt can transfer its aryl group to another aromatic ring. So, in this case, the diazonium group (from product 3) would transfer its aryl group to anisole's ring, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, but product 3 is 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. So the diazonium salt would be 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene. When this reacts with anisole, perhaps it forms a biaryl compound where the benzene ring from the diazonium is connected to the anisole ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by an anisole's ring. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, after the diazonium is formed, the next steps are heating and treating with anisole. Maybe the diazonium group is a leaving group, so perhaps it undergoes a substitution reaction. But in aromatic substitution, the leaving group would typically be in a position where the ring is activated. Wait, but the diazonium group is a strong meta-directing group, so perhaps anisole's ring reacts at a certain position.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by an oxygen nucleophile, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium group is used in a substitution to form a biphenyl structure. Let me think: product 4 is the diazonium salt (1-diazo-3-bromobenzene). Then, when heated, perhaps it loses nitrogen gas, forming a benzene ring with a bromine and a carbon that's a good leaving group? Or maybe undergoes some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by a bond with another benzene ring. Wait, if anisole is present, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium group is a good leaving group, so when treated with anisole, it undergoes a coupling reaction, forming a biphenyl structure. So the anisole's ring would attach to the benzene ring where the diazonium group was.

Wait, but anisole is OMe-substituted. So the product would be a biphenyl with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by an anisole group. That is, the benzene ring (from product 3) would have the amino group replaced by an anisole ring. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows: after the diazonium salt is formed, it's heated, which causes it to lose N2, forming a benzene ring with a positive charge, which could couple with another benzene ring (anisole) in a coupling reaction. So product 4 is the diazonium salt, and when heated, it loses N2 and forms a benzene ring with a positive charge, which then couples with anisole.

Wait, another possibility is that the diazonium salt undergoes a substitution with anisole in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that typically requires activating groups on the aromatic ring to make the substitution feasible. Anisole has a methoxy group, which is activating, so perhaps the benzene ring with the diazonium group can undergo substitution.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each step again, perhaps in a different order.

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene (product 1)
2. Nitrobenzene → bromination (FeBr2) → 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2)
3. Product 2 → hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2) → 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3)
4. Product 3 → diazotization (NaNO2, HBF4) → 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene (product 4)
5. Product 4 → heated, then treated with anisole → ?

So product 4 is the diazonium salt: 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene. Then, when heated, perhaps the diazonium group decomposes. Diazonium salts upon heating (especially in acidic conditions) typically decompose to form a benzene ring with a positive charge (like a benzylium ion), which could then react with a nucleophile or undergo coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is converted into a good leaving group, allowing substitution. But in aromatic substitution, it's not straightforward. Wait, perhaps in the presence of anisole, the diazonium group acts as a leaving group, and the anisole's ring attaches via a coupling reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options to see what the possible structures are.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl → Hmm, fluoro comes from where? I don't see any fluorine in the reagents.

B) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl → Methoxy group in position 2 on the anisole side.

C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl → Methoxy in position 4'.

D) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl → Both substituents on the same ring in position 4 and 4'.

Wait, the starting material is benzene, so all the substituents come from the reactions. So, where could the methoxy come from? Anisole is methoxybenzene, so when it's used in the reaction, perhaps it's transferring the methoxy group.

Wait, but in the last step, product 4 (the diazonium salt) is treated with anisole. So maybe the diazonium group is replaced by the anisole's ring.

Wait, let me think about the reaction between a diazonium salt and anisole. Diazonium salts can undergo various coupling reactions. One possibility is that the diazonium group is a good leaving group, and under certain conditions, it can be replaced by another group. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring with the diazonium group couples with anisole to form a biphenyl.

Ah, here's a thought: when a diazonium salt reacts with another aromatic compound, especially in the presence of a metal catalyst like copper, it can undergo a coupling reaction called the Ullmann coupling or the Friedlander coupling. But in this case, the conditions might not include a metal catalyst, but perhaps the diazonium salt is heated in the presence of anisole.

Alternatively, when the diazonium salt is heated, it can lose N2, forming a benzene ring with a carbocation-like site, which can then react with anisole's ring in a coupling reaction.

So, product 4 is 1-diazo-3-bromo-benzene. Heating this would cause the diazo group to decompose, possibly forming a benzene ring with a positive charge or a good leaving group. Then, when anisole is added, the benzene ring from anisole might couple with the main ring, forming a biphenyl structure.

But where would the substituents go? Let's imagine the main ring (from product 3) has a bromine at position 3 and an amino group at position 1, which was converted to diazo. After decomposition, the main ring has a bromine at position 3 and a position where coupling occurs.

Wait, when the diazonium group is at position 1, and the ring is coupled with anisole, perhaps the coupling occurs at the position where the diazonium was. So, the main ring would lose the diazonium group and form a bond with the anisole ring.

Wait, but anisole is a methoxy-substituted benzene. So, when the coupling occurs, the anisole's ring would attach to the main ring, and the methoxy group would be in a specific position relative to the coupling site.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the anisole's ring attaches at the position where the diazonium group was, and the methoxy group in anisole is in a certain position relative to that.

Wait, perhaps the main ring (from product 3) has the bromine at position 3 and the coupling occurs at position 1 (where the diazonium was). The anisole ring would attach at position 1 of the main ring. But anisole itself is a benzene ring with a methoxy group. So when it couples, the methoxy group's position relative to the coupling site would determine the final structure.

Wait, if the anisole attaches at position 1 of the main ring, then the methoxy group is in position 1 of the anisole's ring. But that's not how the options are presented. Alternatively, perhaps the main ring is still the benzene ring, with substituents, and the anisole's ring is attached to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure forms, with the main ring being the one that had the bromine and the diazonium group, and the anisole's ring is attached at the position where the diazonium was.

Wait, perhaps product 5 is a biphenyl where the main ring has a bromine at position 3 and the other ring (anisole) is attached at position 1. But the anisole's ring has a methoxy group. Where is it located?

Wait, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the anisole's ring attaches to the main ring at the position where the diazonium group was (position 1). So, the main ring now has the bromine at position 3, and the anisole's ring is attached at position 1. The methoxy group in anisole is at position 1 of its own ring, but in the biphenyl structure, that would be the position relative to the main ring.

Wait, but in biphenyl structures, the substituents on each ring are independent. So if the anisole's ring is attached to the main ring at position 1, the methoxy group on the anisole's ring would be at a certain position relative to the point of attachment.

Alternatively, perhaps the anisole's ring is attached in such a way that the methoxy group is in the para position relative to the point of attachment. Wait, but that's assuming the anisole's ring is reoriented, which might not be the case.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. The main ring (from product 3) has a bromine at position 3 and the anisole's ring is attached at position 1. The anisole's ring has a methoxy group at position 1. So, in the biphenyl structure, the main ring has substituents at position 1 (the point of attachment to the anisole ring) and position 3 (bromine). The anisole ring has a methoxy at position 1 of its own ring. So, in the biphenyl, the methoxy would be attached at the position that's adjacent to the main ring.

Wait, maybe it's easier to number the rings. Let's say the main ring is ring A, and the anisole's ring is ring B. The main ring A has a bromine at position 3 and is attached to ring B at position 1. Ring B (anisole) has a methoxy group at position 1 of its own. But in the biphenyl structure, the point of attachment would be between the two rings, so the methoxy is at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 relative to ring A.

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled in the numbering. Let's think differently. The biphenyl product would have two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The main ring (ring A) has substituents at positions 1 and 3: a bromine at 3 and a connection to ring B at 1. Ring B has a methoxy group at position 1 of its own, which is the same as position 1 on ring A. So, in the biphenyl, the methoxy would be in the same position as the connection point, which would be position 1 of ring B, leading to a structure where the substituents are adjacent on ring B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So, the main ring has a bromine at position 3, and the attached ring (ring B) has a methoxy at position 4' (which is the 4 position on ring B). How would that happen?

If the main ring (ring A) has a bromine at position 3 and is attached to ring B at position 1. Then, the methoxy group on ring B is at position 4, which is the para position relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So, in ring B, the methoxy is at position 4, which would be opposite to the point where it's attached to ring A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when anisole (with methoxy at position 1) couples at position 1 of ring A, the methoxy on ring B would be at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 of ring A. But that's the point of attachment, so perhaps the methoxy is at position 4' for the biphenyl structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the methoxy group on ring B ends up at position 4' relative to ring A's position 1.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure. Let's say ring A has substituents at 1 (biphenyl connection) and 3 (Br). Ring B is connected at ring A's 1 position. On ring B, the substituent is OMe at position 4 (relative to the connection point at 1). So, ring B has OMe at position 4, which is the para position to the connection point.

So, the final product would have a Br at position 3 on ring A, and a OMe at position 4 on ring B. So the structure would be 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which corresponds to option C.

Wait, but how does that happen? When product 4 (1-diazo-3-bromo-benzene) is heated and treated with anisole, the diazo group is replaced by the anisole ring. So, the benzene ring from product 4 loses the diazo group and gains a bond to anisole's ring. The position where the diazo was (position 1) becomes the point of attachment for the anisole ring.

Anisole's ring has a methoxy group at position 1 (its own numbering). When it couples to ring A at ring A's position 1, the methoxy on ring B would be at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 of ring A. But in the biphenyl structure, the positions are numbered relative to their own rings. So ring B's position 1 is attached to ring A's position 1. Then, the methoxy on ring B is at position 1, and in the biphenyl, that would be the same as the point of attachment. But that doesn't seem to match the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the coupling mechanism. When a benzene ring (ring A) with a diazonium group at position 1 reacts with anisole (ring B with OMe at position 1), the coupling would occur between ring A's position 1 and ring B's position 1. So, the two rings are connected at their respective position 1, making a 1,1'-biphenyl structure.

But in this case, ring A has a bromine at position 3, and ring B has a methoxy at position 1. So, the biphenyl would be 1,1'-biphenyl with ring A having Br at position 3 and ring B having OMe at position 1. So, the structure would be 3-bromo-1-methoxy-1'-phenyl biphenyl. But none of the options seem to match that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So, if the methoxy is at 4', that's the para position on ring B relative to the point of attachment at 1'. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps during the coupling reaction, the anisole's ring orients such that the methoxy group ends up in a different position relative to the point of attachment. Alternatively, maybe the coupling leads to a meta or para orientation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coupling. Let me think about the actual reaction.

The diazonium salt (on ring A) is at position 1. When it undergoes coupling with anisole (ring B), the coupling occurs at position 1 of both rings. So, ring A's position 1 is bonded to ring B's position 1. Thus, ring B's substituents are positioned relative to this bond.

In anisole, the methoxy is at position 1. So, when ring B becomes attached to ring A at position 1 of ring B, the methoxy is also at position 1 of ring B, which is now the same as position 1 of ring A. So, in the biphenyl, the methoxy would be at position 1' (because it's on ring B), making the structure 1'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. But ring A also has a Br at position 3.

So the structure would be 3-bromo-1'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So the methoxy is at 4' on ring B. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps during the coupling reaction, the substituents on ring B (anisole) are positioned in a way that the methoxy is at the para position relative to the point of attachment. But why would that happen? Anisole is OMe at position 1. When it couples, the point of attachment would be position 1 of ring B, making the methoxy at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as position 1 of ring A. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe another approach: after the coupling, the final product is a biphenyl. The main ring (ring A) has a Br at position 3 and is connected to ring B at position 1. Ring B has a methoxy group which, in the biphenyl structure, is at position 4'.

Hmm. How would the methoxy end up at 4'?

Perhaps the coupling leads to some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs such that the methoxy is in the meta position relative to the point of attachment.

Wait, another possibility: the coupling reaction between the diazonium salt and anisole leads to the transfer of the aryl group from the diazonium to the anisole. So, the benzene ring from the diazonium (ring A) becomes attached to the anisole's ring (ring B) at a certain position, leading to the substituents being in specific positions.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium group (ring A) is attached to the anisole's ring (ring B) at a position that's para to the methoxy group. So, ring B would have the methoxy at position 4, and the point of attachment at position 1. Then, the biphenyl would have the Br at position 3 on ring A and the OMe at position 4' on ring B.

So, that would give 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

But why would the coupling occur in such a way that the methoxy is para to the point of attachment?

Wait, perhaps the coupling isn't directly between the two rings but involves some intermediates. Alternatively, maybe the conditions lead to the methoxy group directing the coupling.

Another thought: when the diazonium salt (ring A) is heated with anisole (ring B, OMe at 1), perhaps the OMe group on ring B directs the coupling to a specific position. Anisole's OMe is an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So, in ring B, the coupling would occur at the para position relative to the OMe group.

Wait, but ring B is the one with OMe. If the coupling occurs at the para position relative to OMe, then the point of attachment (where ring A connects) would be at position 4 of ring B. So, ring B would have OMe at position 1 and the connection to ring A at position 4. Then, in the biphenyl, the OMe would be at position 4', and ring A would have the Br at position 3.

So the structure would be ring A with Br at 3 and connected to ring B at position 1 (since the connection is from ring A's position 1 to ring B's position 4). Wait, no, because ring B is being attached to ring A's position 1. So, ring B would be connected at its position 4 to ring A's position 1, leading to the OMe at 1 on ring B.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- After diazotization and heating, the coupling occurs between ring A (from product 3) and ring B (anisole).

- Ring A has Br at position 3 and is connected to ring B at position 1.

- Ring B (anisole) has OMe at position 1 (its own numbering).

- But when ring B is connected to ring A, the OMe would be at position 1 of ring B, which is the same as the point of attachment. So, in the biphenyl structure, the OMe would be at position 1'.

But option C is 4'-methoxy. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the coupling occurs such that the OMe on ring B is at position 4' relative to the point of attachment (position 1'). So, the OMe is at position 4' on ring B.

How would that happen? Maybe due to the directing effects of the OMe group on ring B. Since OMe is an activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So, when the coupling occurs, the point of attachment (from ring A) would be at the para position relative to the OMe on ring B. Therefore, on ring B, OMe is at position 1, and the point of attachment is at position 4. So, in the biphenyl structure, the OMe is at 4' relative to the point of attachment at 1'.

So the final structure would have:

- Ring A: Br at position 3, connected to ring B at position 1.

- Ring B: OMe at position 4', connected to ring A at position 1'.

Thus, the structure is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

So, putting it all together:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Nitrobenzene → bromination → 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

3. Hydrogenation → 1-amino-3-bromobenzene.

4. Diazotization → 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene.

5. Coupling with anisole → 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, leading to a final product after multiple transformations. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration of Benzene**: Benzene reacts with HNO₃ and H₂SO₄, resulting in nitrobenzene (product 1). The nitro group (-NO₂) is introduced at the para position due to the symmetry of benzene.

2. **Bromination of Nitrobenzene**: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br₂ and Fe powder, leading to bromination. The nitro group is a strong meta-director, so bromine is added at the meta position relative to the nitro group, forming 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction of Nitrobenzene**: Product 2 (1-nitro-3-bromobenzene) is subjected to hydrogenation with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. The nitro group (-NO₂) is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), forming 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3).

4. **Diazotization**: Product 3 (1-amino-3-bromobenzene) is treated with NaNO₂ and HBF₄, converting the amino group (-NH₂) into a diazonium group (-N₂⁺). This forms 1-diazo-3-bromobenzene (product 4).

5. **Coupling with Anisole**: Product 4 (1-diazo-3-bromobenzene) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). The diazonium group acts as a leaving group, and a coupling reaction occurs. The diazonium group is replaced by the anisole ring, forming a biphenyl structure. The methoxy group (-OMe) on anisole is directed to the para position relative to the point of attachment due to its activating nature.

### Final Product:
The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**. This structure has:
- A bromine atom at position 3 on the main ring (ring A).
- A methoxy group (-OMe) at position 4' on the anisole ring (ring B), which is para to the point of attachment (position 1').

### Correct Option:
C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

ANSWER: C
