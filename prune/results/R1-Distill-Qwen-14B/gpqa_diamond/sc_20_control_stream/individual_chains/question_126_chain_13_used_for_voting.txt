Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, both using LAH or NaBH4 as reducing agents. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, let me understand each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that structure in my head. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Let's see: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan has six carbons. So, 3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the substituent is 5-methoxy. Oh, so the substituent is on carbon 5. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, carbon 3 is the ketone. So, numbering from 1 to 6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH2CH3?

Wait, no, wait, the structure is:

The parent chain is hexan-3-one, so it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would be 3-pentanone? No, wait, hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, hexane has six carbons. So, 3-ketone would be: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-hexanone, which would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, 3-hexanone would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's 3-hexanone as:

(CH2)2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hexan means six carbons. So, 3-hexanone is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3-CH3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, in the problem, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which means on position 5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:

Positions 1-6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH2CH3? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is six carbons, with the ketone at 3. Carbon 5 would be two carbons after the ketone.

Wait, maybe a better way is to write the structure.

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So:

The carbons are numbered from 1 to 6.

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH2CH3?

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Let me count:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be 3-pentanone, not hexanone. Oh, wait, no, 3-hexanone is correct as I thought before.

So, the structure is:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3.

Wait, no, hexan has six carbons. So, the full structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the substituent is methoxy on carbon 5. So, carbon 5 is CH2? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(=O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons in the chain after the ketone. No, wait, hexan is six carbons. So, the positions are:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The correct IUPAC name is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that would be 3-pentanone. Hmm, maybe I should just accept that I'm getting the structure right and think about the reaction.

So, LAH will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So, the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but is the configuration retained or changed?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and in ketones, it typically gives secondary alcohols. But since the starting compound is a chiral center, the configuration might change?

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon. The 5th carbon is CH(OCH3). So, when we reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol at C3, the configuration at C5, which is the methoxy group, is not directly involved in the reduction. So, the configuration at C5 (the S configuration) remains unchanged. So, the product after Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait. No, the ketone is at C3, so the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, so after reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes an alcohol (CH-OH). So, the product is hexan-3-ol with a methoxy group at C5. And the configuration at C5 remains S.

So, Product I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2COCH3? Wait, no. Let me think. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, pentane has five carbons. So, the structure is O=C-(CH2)-CO-(CH2)2-CH3? No, wait, 2 and 4 positions.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. Wait, no, that would be 2,4-pentanedione, which is correct. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be four carbons. Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula is (CH3)COCH2COCH3? No, I think it's (CH3)2COCH2COCH3. No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons? Wait, no, that's four carbons. Hmm, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, which is five carbons in total. So, positions 2 and 4 have ketones.

Wait, but pentane has five carbons, so the structure is:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3?

No, that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should think of it as 2,4-dione, meaning the two ketone groups are on carbons 2 and 4.

So, the structure is:

(CH2)2C(O)CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait, let me count:

1: CH3-

2: C=O

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be 2,4-dione on a four-carbon chain, but it's pentane-2,4-dione. So, perhaps:

1: CH3-

2: C=O

3: CH-

4: C=O

5: CH3.

But that would be 2 and 4 on a five-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that's 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain. So, yes, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me write it as O=C-(CH2)-CO-(CH2)-CH3. Wait, that can't be because that's six carbons. No, it's pentane, five carbons. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's six again. Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

Wait, perhaps pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, that's five carbons? Wait, (CH3)CO-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 would be six carbons. Hmm, perhaps it's (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH2CH3? No, that's six. I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me just accept that it's a diketone with two ketone groups, perhaps at positions 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain.

So, when treated with excess NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketones will be reduced. However, in the case of diketones, if both are ketones, NaBH4 would reduce both to secondary alcohols.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a milder reductant compared to LAH in some cases, but in this case, it's being used with excess. So, both ketones would be reduced.

So, pentane-2,4-dione would become pentane-2,4-diol after reduction. Wait, but wait, no, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but that's six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's O=C-(CH2)3-CO-... No, perhaps I should just proceed.

Assuming that pentane-2,4-dione reduces to 2,4-pentanediol. Now, how is that possible? Let me think.

Each ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a CH(OH) group. So, the structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, maybe the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. That's five carbons? No, because it's O=C, then CH2, then CO, then CH2, then CH3. That's five carbons in the chain. So, the positions are 2 and 4. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

So, when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be because that's five carbons. Wait, the structure would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but that's six carbons, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3. No, that would be six carbons. Oh, wait, perhaps I was wrong about the structure. Maybe pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. So, that's five carbons in total. So, the reduction would give HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that Reaction II produces a diol, which is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, this diol could be a meso compound because, if the two hydroxyl groups are on symmetric positions, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, 2,4-pentanediol would have OH groups on C2 and C4. Let me think about the structure: CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's 2 and 4 positions. So, the molecule would be HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Would this be a meso compound?

Yes, because the two OH groups are on positions 2 and 4, which are symmetric with respect to the center of the chain. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, the diol from Reaction II would be a meso compound with no stereocenters.

Alternatively, if it's 2,4-pentanediol, the molecule would have two chiral centers, but because of the plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound, so it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral overall.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: in 2,4-pentanediol, the two hydroxyls are on C2 and C4. The structure is HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Is this a meso compound?

Yes, because if you draw a mirror plane between the middle two carbons, the groups on either side mirror each other. So, the compound is achiral, despite having two stereocenters. Therefore, Reaction II produces a single product: meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound with no optical activity.

Wait, no. Wait, when you reduce a diketone, each ketone is reduced to an -OH group. So, pentane-2,4-dione would become 2,4-pentanediol. Now, 2,4-pentanediol has two stereocenters (C2 and C4), each bearing OH, CH2CH3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, let me think again. The structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me number the carbons:

1: CH3-

2: CH(OH)-

3: CH2-

4: CH(OH)-

5: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if it's 2 and 4 positions, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. So, the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So, the positions 2 and 4 have the OH groups. Now, the molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's check:

At C2: groups are OH, CH2CH3, CH2OH, and CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me correctly list the groups attached to C2 and C4.

At C2: the groups are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one from C1 and C3),

and a CH2 group leading to C3.

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me imagine the structure properly. The molecule is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - CH(OH) - CH2 - CH3.

So, each OH is on C2 and C4.

Now, looking at C2: it's connected to:

- C1: CH3,

- C3: CH2,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH2(OH) (C2) connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two other CH2 groups? I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

So, C1: CH3,

C2: CH2(OH),

C3: CH2,

C4: CH(OH),

C5: CH3.

Wait, no, wait. If the molecule is HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, that's five carbons. So, the structure is:

1: CH3,

2: CH2(OH),

3: CH2,

4: CH(OH),

5: CH3.

Wait, no, that's five carbons. So, C2 is CH2(OH), C4 is CH(OH).

Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

Groups: CH3-CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that can't be because that's six carbons. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

So, in this case, C2 is CH2(OH), and C4 is CH(OH). Wait, but CH(OH) would have four substituents, which is impossible. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me correct this. The correct structure for 2,4-pentanediol would be:

HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons. I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, pentane has five carbons, so the correct structure for 2,4-pentanediol is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

That's 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain. So, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This way, the molecule has two OH groups on C2 and C4, each with two CH2 groups. Now, this molecule would have two stereocenters: C2 and C4.

Now, considering the configuration of these stereocenters. Let's see, if both are R, or both S, or one R and one S.

But wait, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, the configurations would be such that it's a meso compound. For example, if C2 is R and C4 is S, but due to the symmetry, the molecule would be achiral overall. So, the product of Reaction II is a single meso compound, which is a diastereomer but achiral.

Wait, no. If the two stereocenters are mirror images, then the molecule is meso and thus achiral. So, Reaction II produces a single product.

Wait, but wait. When you reduce a diketone, each ketone is reduced by NaBH4. So, pentane-2,4-dione becomes 2,4-pentanediol. The structure as I thought before is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, each OH is on C2 and C4.

Now, when NaBH4 is used in excess, it should reduce both ketones. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, only one product is formed.

Wait, but let me think about the stereochemistry. Since the starting material is a symmetrical diketone, when reduced, would it produce a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture?

Wait, the starting material is symmetrical, so the reducing agent would produce a single stereoisomer due to the symmetry. Or would it?

Wait, when a symmetrical diketone is reduced, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. Since the two ketones are identical, and the molecule is symmetrical, the reduction would lead to a single product, which is the meso compound.

So, Reaction II gives a single product: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

Now, moving on. The products from both reactions are combined. Let's list the products:

Product I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Product II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound, single product).

So, when these are combined, how many different compounds are there?

Product I is a single enantiomer, and Product II is a single compound. So, in total, two different compounds.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Product I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group in the molecule.

Product II is 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is a diol.

So, when combined, there are two distinct compounds.

Now, the combined products are run on normal-phase HPLC and on a chiral HPLC column.

Let me first think about the normal-phase HPLC. Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, with more polar compounds eluting later (higher retention times). So, the number of peaks corresponds to the number of different compounds, considering their polarity.

In this case, the two products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a secondary alcohol, some polarity.

2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso): a diol, more polar than the first product.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, each would elute at different times, giving two peaks.

Now, what about the chiral HPLC? Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers or diastereomers. Since the chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, causing them to elute at different times.

Looking at each product:

Product I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a single enantiomer. On a chiral column, would it show as one peak because it's a single enantiomer, or would it interact in a way that causes more peaks?

Wait, no. Because it's a single enantiomer, it would produce one peak on a chiral column. But wait, could there be any other stereocenters in Product I that would lead to more peaks?

Wait, the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let me check if there are any other stereocenters. The structure is:

The 3-position is the alcohol (from the ketone reduction), so the configuration at C3 depends on the reaction conditions. Wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 becomes a stereocenter. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5, but the reduction of the ketone at C3 would create a new stereocenter at C3.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me re-examine Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH.

The starting material has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). The ketone is at C3. When reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter at C3. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically provides high stereoselectivity, often leading to the formation of the alcohol with the R configuration if the ketone was prochiral and the hydrogen was added from the less hindered side.

Wait, but the starting material is a chiral ketone. So, the configuration at C5 is S, but the ketone is at C3. So, when reduced, the C3 becomes a stereocenter. The configuration at C3 would depend on the reaction's stereoselectivity.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe it's:

The starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, when LAH is used to reduce the ketone, the product will be (something)-3-ol, with a new stereocenter at C3.

But since the starting material is chiral at C5, does it influence the configuration at C3? Or is the reduction stereoselective in a way that forms a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C3 is a new stereocenter, leading to a pair of enantiomers. Or perhaps the reaction is not stereoselective, leading to a racemic mixture. But LAH is a strong reducing agent and usually provides high stereoselectivity.

Wait, but in this case, the starting molecule is chiral, so during the reduction, the hydrogen adds from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So, the product would be a single enantiomer at C3, but the configuration at C5 remains S.

Wait, but that would mean that the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. So, the product is a diastereomer, not an enantiomer.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. The reduction introduces a new stereocenter at C3, which would be either R or S, depending on the reaction's stereoselectivity.

So, the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with a new configuration at C3. But wait, does the configuration at C3 depend on the starting material's configuration at C5?

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction at C3 is not influenced by the configuration at C5, and the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but since the starting material is chiral at C5, the product ends up as a single diastereomer, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer because the reaction is stereoselective, leading to a specific configuration at C3, and the configuration at C5 is already set as S. So, the product has two stereocenters and is a single diastereomer.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone on C3 and a methoxy on C5, which is chiral (S configuration).

When LAH reduces the ketone at C3, it adds a hydrogen to the carbonyl carbon, making it an alcohol. The addition of hydrogen can be from either face, leading to either R or S configuration at C3. But with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, the reaction is stereoselective and typically proceeds via a planar intermediate (like in the case of ketone reduction), leading to a racemic mixture unless there's an existing chiral center that induces asymmetry.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is chiral, so the reaction might not produce a racemic mixture but instead a single enantiomer due to the influence of the existing chiral center. This is known as the chiral induction effect. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making the product a single stereoisomer with both C3 and C5 as stereocenters.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, C3 and C5, both set in a specific way.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be a single stereoisomer, but with two stereocenters. So, when run on a chiral HPLC column, would it show as one peak?

Yes, because it's a single compound.

Wait, but wait. Suppose the product has two stereocenters, but they are both R and S, leading to a single stereoisomer. So, on a chiral HPLC, it will elute as a single peak because it's a single compound.

Now, the other product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is a single compound because it's a meso form. So, when combined, we have two products: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (with C3 and C5 stereocenters) and 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So, each is a single compound.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, each would elute as a separate peak, giving two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, each would elute as a separate peak because they're different compounds. But wait, the question is about how many peaks in each HPLC.

Wait, the chiral HPLC separates enantiomers and diastereomers. So, for the two products, Product I is a single stereoisomer (two stereocenters), and Product II is a meso compound, which is a single stereoisomer.

So, when run on a chiral column, each would be a single peak because they are each a single compound. So, the total peaks would be two on both HPLC columns.

But wait, let me double-check. Because Product I has two stereocenters, but it's a single stereoisomer, so it would be a single peak on a chiral column. Similarly, Product II is a meso compound, which is a single stereoisomer, so it would elute as a single peak.

So, on the chiral column, two peaks. On normal-phase, two peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks for both. Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Hmm, I thought it would be two peaks each, but that's not an option. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I missed some products. Let me re-examine each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent. It reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. When reducing C3, does a new stereocenter form?

Yes, the product would have a stereocenter at C3. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with a specific configuration at C3. But the question is whether the product is a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, LAH typically gives high stereoselectivity in the reduction of ketones. So, the product would be a single enantiomer at C3. But since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5 (S), the product would have two stereocenters, C3 and C5.

So, the product is a single diastereomer. But wait, the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction introduces (R) or (S) at C3. So, the product would be a single stereoisomer with two stereocenters.

Wait, but when considering all possible stereoisomers, for two stereocenters, there are 2^2 =4 possibilities. But since the starting material is a specific enantiomer, the product would be a specific diastereomer, resulting in a single product.

Wait, but perhaps when you reduce the ketone, the configuration at C3 is determined by the existing configuration at C5. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, with specific configurations at C3 and C5.

So, the product from Reaction I is a single compound with two stereocenters.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is a single compound.

So, when both products are combined, there are two compounds: a single diastereomer (Product I) and a single meso compound (Product II).

On normal-phase HPLC, each would be a separate peak, so two peaks.

On a chiral column, each would also be a separate peak because they're different compounds. So, two peaks on chiral HPLC.

But the options don't have an option with two peaks in both cases. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the products.

Let me think again about Reaction I.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

When reduced with LAH, the ketone becomes an alcohol, so the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The configuration at C3 would be either R or S, depending on the reduction's stereoselectivity.

But since the starting material is chiral at C5, which is (S), the reduction at C3 might be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to a specific configuration at C3, making the product a single diastereomer.

So, Product I is a single compound with two stereocenters.

Now, when run on a chiral column, each distinct stereoisomer would elute as a separate peak.

Wait, but in this case, Product I is a single diastereomer, so it would be one peak. Product II is a meso compound, a single compound, so another peak. So, total two peaks.

But according to the options, the only option with two is not present. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the products. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. LAH is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps it can reduce other functional groups as well? No, the starting material only has a ketone and an ether group. LAH would reduce the ketone but leave the ether untouched.

So, only one product from Reaction I.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the possibility that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reduction is stereoselective, the product should be a single enantiomer at C3, making it a single diastereomer overall.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. No, because LAH is stereoselective, and the starting material is chiral, leading to a single product.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of the ketone in Reaction I leads to a new chiral center, and the configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration, leading to a single product with two chiral centers.

So, Product I is a single compound with two chiral centers.

Product II is a single compound (meso).

So, when combined, two distinct compounds.

On normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the products.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction II, the product is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no, because pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical, so the reduction would produce a single meso compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with more than one possible configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that doesn't make sense because the starting material is chiral and LAH is stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has another chiral center besides C3.

Wait, no. The product has C3 and C5 as stereocenters.

Wait, the starting material has C5 as S, and after reduction, C3 becomes R or S.

So, Product I: C3 is R or S, and C5 is S.

So, the product has two stereocenters, making four possible stereoisomers. But because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single diastereomer.

So, Product I is a single compound.

Product II is a single compound.

So, combined, two compounds.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. For example, if the starting material is a chiral ketone, the reduction could lead to a racemic mixture at C3, but since the starting material is chiral, perhaps it leads to two diastereomers.

Wait, no. No, the reduction of a single enantiomer of a chiral ketone with a stereoselective reducing agent would lead to a single enantiomer at the new chiral center, thus a single diastereomer overall.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers or a single diastereomer. Let me think.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure has a chiral center at C5. The ketone is at C3. When reduced, the product has a new chiral center at C3.

The reaction's stereoselectivity would determine the configuration at C3. If the reaction is stereoselective, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making it a single diastereomer with C3 and C5 both set.

So, Product I is a single diastereomer.

Product II is a single compound.

So, two compounds in total.

On normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the question is different.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers because the configuration at C3 is not influenced by the existing configuration at C5, leading to racemization.

But that doesn't make sense because the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, and the other product from Reaction II is a meso compound, leading to two compounds.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that the normal-phase HPLC shows two peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows two peaks. But none of the options match.

Looking back at the options, the only option that has two peaks in both is not present. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II produces two products. Let me re-examine Reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? Or perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, which is five carbons. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, when reduced with NaBH4, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's six carbons. I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two hydroxyl groups on C2 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. But that's five carbons. So, the molecule would have two stereocenters at C2 and C4.

Now, considering the stereochemistry, if both OH groups are on the same face (R,R or S,S), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are mirrored, making it a meso compound.

So, the product is a meso compound, a single compound.

So, Reaction II gives a single product.

So, the total products are two: Product I (single diastereomer) and Product II (meso).

So, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product.

Let me think again. The product of Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure has a hydroxyl group on C3 and a methoxy on C5. So, the stereocenters are at C3 and C5.

The starting material was (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So, the product has two stereocenters.

If the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with specific configurations at both C3 and C5, then it's a single compound.

So, when run on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak.

Product II is a meso compound, which is a single compound, so another peak.

So, total two peaks on chiral HPLC.

On normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But that can't be because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reaction is stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a mixture of diastereomers, leading to more than one peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that doesn't fit with the stereoselective reduction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram shows.

The products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: single compound, two stereocenters.

2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso): single compound.

So, in total, two compounds.

On normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. So, perhaps I'm wrong in the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product.

Wait, maybe the product from Reaction I has only one stereocenter. Let me think.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

The structure is CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, the reduction introduces a stereocenter at C3. So, the product has a stereocenter at C3 and another at C5 (from the starting material). So, two stereocenters.

Thus, the product is a diastereomer, a single compound with two stereocenters.

So, when run on a chiral column, it would show as one peak.

Product II is a meso compound, one peak.

So, total two peaks on both HPLC columns.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps there's another mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. But that's unlikely because the starting material is chiral and the reduction is stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, leading to a total of two compounds.

Thus, in the combined mixture, two compounds, leading to two peaks in each HPLC.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I isn't a diastereomer but a single enantiomer, leading to only one peak on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but Reaction I's product has two stereocenters, so it's a diastereomer, not an enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the chiral HPLC would separate any diastereomers, but if they're not present, it would show as one peak.

So, in this case, both products are different compounds, each a single stereoisomer, so each would be a single peak on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but the two products are different compounds, so on the chiral column, each would have a separate retention time, leading to two peaks.

Similarly, on normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have two peaks in both.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the reduction in Reaction I leads to more than one product. For example, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center, and the reduction leads to a mixture of diastereomers.

But no, with LAH being stereoselective, it should give a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers because the reduction is not influenced by the existing chiral center.

But that would mean two stereoisomers from Reaction I, leading to two products, and Reaction II gives one product, leading to three in total.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, three peaks.

On chiral HPLC, three peaks because each enantiomer would be separated.

But I thought the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer.

This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC, and Reaction II gives one peak, leading to three peaks on chiral HPLC.

But that would align with option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Wait, but why would Reaction I produce a pair of enantiomers?

Because the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 could lead to a racemic mixture at C3, making the product a racemic mixture. But LAH is known to be stereoselective, so it's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, but when considering the two stereocenters, it's a single compound.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that each HPLC shows two peaks. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II produces more than one product. Let me think.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

If the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, and NaBH4 is used, it would reduce each ketone to an alcohol, leading to 2,4-pentanediol. But if the reduction isn't complete, or if some other reaction occurs, perhaps other products form. But the question states that the reactions are 100% complete, so only the intended product is formed.

So, Reaction II gives one product.

Thus, combining Reaction I's product (one) and Reaction II's product (one), total two compounds.

So, two peaks on normal-phase and two on chiral.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a mixture of diastereomers, leading to more than one peak.

But I can't see why that would happen. The starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereoselective, leading to a single product.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, where the chiral HPLC shows three peaks, and the normal-phase HPLC shows two.

Wait, how would that happen?

If Reaction I produces two diastereomers, and Reaction II produces one, then total three compounds, leading to three peaks on chiral and two on normal-phase.

But why would Reaction I produce two diastereomers?

Perhaps because the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but influenced by the existing C5 configuration, leading to two diastereomers.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product has another stereocenter.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to make an educated guess.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the number of stereocenters in each product.

Product I: two stereocenters (C3 and C5), single diastereomer.

Product II: two stereocenters (C2 and C4), but meso, so single compound.

So, when run on chiral HPLC, each would be a single peak, leading to two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC, and Reaction II produces one, leading to three peaks on chiral HPLC.

But why would Reaction I produce a racemic mixture?

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has another stereocenter I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diol, leading to more stereocenters. No, the product is a secondary alcohol, not a diol.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the options, the correct answer is likely option B: 3 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reaction**: Treated with LAH, a strong reducing agent, followed by acidic workup.
- **Product**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, resulting in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This introduces a new stereocenter at C3. Since LAH is stereoselective, the product is a single diastereomer with stereocenters at C3 and C5.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reaction**: Treated with excess NaBH4, a reducing agent, followed by acidic workup.
- **Product**: Both ketones are reduced to alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, this product is a meso compound, which is a single compound with no optical activity.

### Combined Products:
- **Product I**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single diastereomer with two stereocenters).
- **Product II**: 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound, single product).

Thus, the combined products consist of two distinct compounds.

---

### Analysis of HPLC Results:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - This type of HPLC separates compounds based on polarity. Since the two products (Product I and Product II) are distinct compounds with different polarities, they will elute as separate peaks.
   - **Number of Peaks**: 2.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers and diastereomers. 
   - **Product I**: A single diastereomer with two stereocenters, so it will elute as one peak.
   - **Product II**: A meso compound, which is a single stereoisomer, so it will also elute as one peak.
   - **Number of Peaks**: 2.

---

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC — Incorrect. The number of peaks is far too high.
- **Option B**: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC — Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both cases.
- **Option C**: 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC — Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both cases.
- **Option D**: 3 Peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC — Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both cases.

---

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is not explicitly listed in the options provided. Based on the analysis, the normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC should each show **2 peaks**. However, since none of the options match this conclusion, the closest plausible answer is **Option B** (3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC), assuming an error in the question or options.

**Answer: B**
