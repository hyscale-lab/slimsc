Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a compound X that undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. We need to figure out what the final product is. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of substitution reaction. Oh right, it's probably a substitution where a leaving group is replaced. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of certain groups or maybe for elimination. Wait, no, I think when you have a compound with a good leaving group and react it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to cleave certain bonds. Oh wait, I think it's the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, like an S_N2 mechanism, but I'm not exactly sure.

Let me look at the IR and NMR data for compound X first because that should help me identify what X is. Maybe from the spectroscopic data I can figure out the structure of X, and then see what reaction would occur with red phosphorus and HI.

So, the IR data: 3400-2500 cm^-1 suggests maybe an -OH group or an amine, but looking at the options, the products don't seem to have amines. The major peaks are around 1720, 1610, 1450 cm^-1. The 1720 peak is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester or maybe an acid. Wait, but if it's an acid, the O-H stretch would be in the 3400 region, but I don't see a broad peak around 2500-3000 which would be more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the IR does have a peak in 3400-2500, which could be an alcohol or an amine, but perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, the 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl. For a ketone, that's around 1700-1750. So maybe it's a ketone. The 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which might be an -OH proton, but considering the other data, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but a broad peak could also be an exchange with D2O, like an acidic proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to something else. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be around 10-12 ppm, but in this case, the 10.5 is a singlet, but a broad one. But in the IR, the 1720 could also fit a carboxylic acid's carbonyl? Wait, no, carboxylic acids have a lower carbonyl around 1700 but they also have a broad O-H stretch which is usually around 2500-3300. But the IR shows a peak at 3400-2500, which is a wide range, so maybe it's a broad O-H. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, there's a 10.5 ppm peak which is a broad singlet. That's typical for a carboxylic acid's -OH proton. So if there's a carboxylic acid group, that might fit. But wait, the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. So if the starting material has a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone, and when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes some kind of substitution. Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is a cleavage of an ester or another carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of esters to acids, but more commonly, they're used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines or maybe in the demethylation of ethers. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI might be used in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but that's more for ketones. Wait, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, I remember that treatment of certain compounds with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the conversion of a ketone into an alcohol. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on an aromatic ring. Wait, the IR data suggests a carbonyl. So if X has a benzene ring with a ketone group, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, maybe the ketone is transformed into something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the cleavage of a protecting group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the NMR doesn't show a peak around 9-10 ppm except for the 10.5, which is a singlet. Wait, maybe X is a benzophenone derivative, but if the carbonyl is at 1720, that fits a ketone.

Looking at the NMR again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe not an aldehyde, but perhaps a phenolic OH? But in that case, the IR would show a broad peak around 3400, which matches. Wait, but if it's a phenol, the NMR would typically have a broad peak, which matches. So perhaps the compound has a phenol group and a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak around 1720 cm^-1 which is a strong carbonyl. If the compound has both a phenol group and a ketone, that's a possibility. Alternatively, the carbonyl could be an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So for example, if you have a substituent in the para position, the two protons next to it would be as a doublet each, leading to two doublets. So the splitting suggests a para-substituted benzene.

So the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene, like a substituent in the para position.

Now, looking at the other peaks in the NMR:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to something. 1.7 (m, 2H) could be another adjacent CH2 group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of 3H as a doublet, which probably indicates a CH(CH3) group. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzyl group attached to a chain that has a ketone or another functional group.

Let me try to sketch this:

The NMR suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if it's para, then substituent is in position 4. Wait, no, the two doublets each for 2H would imply that the substituent is at the para position, causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

Wait, let me think of the para substituent as a substituent that's not adjacent to any other protons, but in reality, if the substituent is at position 4, then the adjacent protons are in positions 3 and 5, but in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is in position 4, so the H's in 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H's in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is on carbon 1, and the ring is symmetric. So for example, in 4-methyl group, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 would be equivalent.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the aromatic region is 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H). So that's two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituent is at the para position, and the substituent is such that it causes the adjacent protons (ortho) to be a certain shift.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. But in this case, the substituent might be something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a peak for a carbonyl, but maybe the carbonyl is part of another group attached.

Wait, let's try to think of the structure. The aromatic protons are 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So let's say the substituent is attached at position 4. Then, the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5) would be around 8.0 ppm, and the meta protons (positions 2 and 6) would be around 7.2 ppm. Or maybe the opposite, depending on the substituent.

Wait, substituents that are electron-withdrawing, like nitro groups, would cause the adjacent (ortho) protons to be deshielded and appear downfield. If the substituent is an electron-donating group, like a methoxy, then the ortho protons would be more shielded and appear upfield.

So in this case, the higher shift (8.0 ppm) is for the ortho protons, and the lower (7.2) for the meta. So the substituent is probably an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ortho protons to be downfield.

So what substituents are para and cause the ortho protons to be around 8.0 ppm? That could be a carbonyl group like a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but let's think about the rest of the NMR data. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another group. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2. The 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a branching, like perhaps a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something like that.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl. Let's see.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a singlet for a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3. So putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO- group. No, wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached with a branch. Let me try to draw this.

Looking at all the non-aromatic signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): This could be a CH adjacent to another group, maybe a ketone.
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): Perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to that CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): A CH3 group attached to a CH, which is also attached to something else.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): A CH2CH3 group, which would be at the end of a chain.

So putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)- group connected to a benzene ring. Wait, but the carbonyl would be part of the substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzophenone derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propyl group attached via a ketone.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone. Like, the benzene ring is attached to a carbonyl group which is connected to a chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2) group attached to a carbonyl and a branching point. Let me think: if the substituent is a -CH2-CO-R group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't involve a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So X must have a carbonyl group. So the substituent on the benzene must be a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet. If that's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a carbonyl alpha to an aromatic ring. Wait, no, the 10.5 is more likely an -OH group, perhaps of a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the peak is from a carboxylic acid, then the IR should show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but the IR data includes 3400-2500 which could be O-H. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think about that.

If X is a para-substituted benzoic acid, for example, 4-(something)benzoic acid, then the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets. The 10.5 ppm peak would be the -COOH proton, which is usually a broad peak. But wait, in the NMR, 10.5 is a singlet. Oh wait, but for a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton is usually a broad singlet. So perhaps that's it.

So, if X is a para-substituted benzoic acid, say 4-(substituent)benzoic acid, then the substituent would be a chain or another group.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent chain would have the signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So the substituent would be something like a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but that doesn't involve a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, if the substituent is a -CH2-CO-R group, but R would have to account for the other NMR signals. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2-CO- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. For example, the substituent is a propyl chain with a ketone, like a -CH2-CO-CH2- group. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but where is the carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH3) group. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2COOH) group, but that's also unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branched chain. Let me think about the signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): A CH adjacent to a carbonyl? Or maybe a CH adjacent to another group.

- 1.7 (m,2H): A CH2 group.

- 1.4 (d,3H): A CH3 group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 (t,3H): A CH2CH3 group.

Putting that together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-R, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that doesn't include a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would mean the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that: the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, in which the branching is on the second carbon. Wait, no, actually, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The straight chain is n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3. The iso-butyl group is (CH3)2CHCH2-, and the sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group? No, that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, with a branching. Let me think: the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, so that would be a 3-methylbutyl group or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR shifts: 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H) is perhaps a CH group that's adjacent to a carbonyl. Because a CH near a carbonyl would experience some deshielding and appear upfield. Wait, but 2.9 is actually a bit low for that. Alternatively, maybe the CH is next to a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO- group. So the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent like -(CH2)CO-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, the substituent is a phenyl group attached to a propyl chain that ends with a carbonyl. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: let's think about what the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but they can also be used in the substitution of halides. But wait, if the substituent is an ester or a ketone, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a ketone. Wait, but I don't think that's the case. Another possibility is that the reaction is a cleavage of a benzyl group or some other group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in X is a benzyl group attached to a ketone. Then, red phosphorus and HI would cause some cleavage.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structures of X based on the NMR and IR.

So, X has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. The substituent also has a branching with a CH(CH3) and a CH2CH3 group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But that would make the structure something like benzene-(CH2)COCH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m,1H) which could be the CH next to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 (d,3H) would be the CH3 on the CH, and the 0.9 (t,3H) would be the CH2CH3 group.

Wait, so putting this together, the substituent would be -(CH2)COCH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be benzene with a propyl group attached via a ketone.

Wait, so X would be 4-(propan-2-yl)benzoic acid? No, wait, if it's a ketone, then it's a benzene ring with a substituent like -(CH2)COCH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but wait, the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which if it's a carboxylic acid, would be a COOH group. But if X is a ketone, then that peak would be something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-O-R group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm^-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C bonds. So that supports the idea that X has a benzene ring.

The 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, so that's a key point. So X has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

So, putting it all together, X is a para-substituted aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, and a substituent that is a branched alkyl chain.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Hmm, looking at these options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzoic acid group (which would explain the 10.5 ppm peak as the COOH proton), and a sec-butyl substituent at the para position.

Wait, but let me think about the substituent. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group attached at the para position.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group, so the NMR should reflect that.

The substituent would be a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So the chain would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, in the NMR:

- The CH(CH2CH3) (the sec-butyl group) would have a triplet of a CH2 group attached to it, perhaps.

Wait, looking at the NMR data for X:

The non-aromatic signals are:

2.9 ppm (m,1H): Maybe the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent.

1.7 ppm (m,2H): The CH2 adjacent to the CH.

1.4 ppm (d,3H): The CH3 attached to the CH.

0.9 ppm (t,3H): The CH2CH3 group at the end.

So that fits a sec-butyl group. Because the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH) attached to the benzene ring, and a sec-butyl group also attached in the para position.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzoic acid is a COOH group attached directly to the benzene ring. So if the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the ring would have COOH in position 1 and the sec-butyl in position 4.

But in the NMR data, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H). If the substituents are in the para positions (COOH and sec-butyl), then the ortho protons would be on either side of the COOH group, and the meta would be next to the sec-butyl. Wait, but perhaps the substituents are both in the para position relative to each other, causing the other positions to have the doublets as observed.

Wait, but in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. So the protons in 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH group (ortho), and 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the sec-butyl group (meta). So the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing COOH group, leading their chemical shifts to be higher, around 8.0 ppm. The meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be adjacent to a substituent, but the sec-butyl is an electron-donating group, so the protons would be more shielded, appearing around 7.2 ppm. That fits with the NMR data.

So in this case, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe this is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what reaction occurs between a benzoic acid and red phosphorus plus HI. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of esters. For example, esters can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids in the presence of red phosphorus and HI. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, then that doesn't make sense.

Wait, but perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me go back. Maybe I was wrong about the 10.5 ppm peak being a COOH proton.

Alternative approach: think about the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think that when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's converted into an amine. But X doesn't seem to have a nitrile group.

Wait, another possibility: if X has a ketone group, then red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an alcohol. Wait, but I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the 10.5 ppm peak might not fit that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a benzyl group. For example, if X has a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl, then the reaction could break that bond.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think again about the structure of X.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be... I'm not sure. I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the demethylation of ethers, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group. Wait, but X is a benzoic acid; unless there's a leaving group attached, which I don't see.

Wait, another approach: what's the product when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI and red phosphorus? I can't recall any such reaction. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but carboxylic acids aren't typically involved in that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid but a ketone. Then, the reaction could be a reduction of the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The IR data has 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If X is a ketone, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the formation of an alcohol. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a propyl group attached via a ketone. For example, benzene-(CH2)2-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. But then, the NMR would have an aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm, which would be a triplet or a singlet, but in the given data, the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which could fit an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes usually have sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm, while a broad peak is more indicative of an -OH group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reaction. The product options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, all options are aromatic compounds with substituents, some with methyl or ethyl groups.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps X is a benzyl tosylate or something similar, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if X has a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl, and the reaction is a hydrolysis of the carbonyl group, perhaps leading to a benzyl alcohol.

But I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me try to think about each option as the product and see what the starting material would look like after the reaction.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached. So, the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a benzene ring. But I'm not sure how the reaction leads to this.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be cumene, a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group. But I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the same as X, which can't be, as X is the starting material.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl and a methyl group in the para positions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a hydrogen or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a substituent. The reaction cleaves the carbonyl, leading to an acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction converts the aldehyde into a carboxylic acid. But then, what would the reagents do?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration of alkenes, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone, and the reaction reduces the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, if X were a ketone, such as benzophenone, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of an alcohol. But I'm not clear on the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a benzyl group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI could be a demethylation reaction, but I don't see any methyl groups in the product options that would fit this.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where a halogen is replaced by something else. For example, if X has a leaving group like a tosylate, the HI would substitute it with an iodide. But I don't see any iodide in the product options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but again, I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option and see which one makes sense when considering the reaction.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is that, then the reaction would leave it unchanged, which can't be the case.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl and methyl group in the para positions. So, the product would be a di-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and methyl group.

If the starting material X had a substituent that, upon reaction, becomes a methyl group, that could make sense. But how?

Wait, perhaps X has a substituent that is a methyl ketone, and the reaction reduces it to a methyl group. For example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then reducing it would lead to 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

But that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a carbonyl group to a methyl group.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction converts the aldehyde into a methyl group. But I'm not sure what reagents would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which might not fit that.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. For example, if X is an ester, like benzene with a substituent R-O-CO-R', then hydrolysis would produce a carboxylic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

But then, what would X look like? If X is an ester, its IR would show a carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. The NMR would have an ester oxygen, but I don't see any peaks that would indicate an ester.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester with a substituent that, upon hydrolysis, becomes a benzoic acid. For example, if X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then hydrolysis would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But if the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid, then perhaps it's a hydrolysis.

But then the product would be option C, which is the same as X. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the reaction as a demethylation or a substitution.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, which are the products. Let's think about what each product would look like when reacted with red phosphorus and HI.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a di-substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Di-substituted with sec-butyl and methyl groups.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the reaction is the hydrolysis of a ketone to a carboxylic acid, then option C would be the product. But then, X would have to be a ketone. Let's see.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then upon hydrolysis, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. For instance, if X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction reduces it to a CH2 group.

Wait, if X is a ketone like (sec-butyl)benzophenone, then reduction would turn the ketone into a CH2 group, leading to a di-substituted benzene with a -CH2- group. But I don't see such an option.

Wait, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, substituents are isobutyl and methyl in the para positions. That structure would result from the reduction of a ketone, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should just make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a branched chain. The IR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

If the reaction is the hydrolysis of a ketone to a carboxylic acid, then option C would be the product. But I'm not sure if that's what the reaction conditions do.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction converts it into a benzoic acid. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the reaction, if X is a benzaldehyde, then red phosphorus and HI could lead to some kind of substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a benzyl group. For example, if X is a benzyl chloride, then HI would substitute it with iodide. But that doesn't fit the IR data.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the NMR and IR data, I'm leaning towards X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product must be something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is modified. But I don't see any options that involve the -COOH group.

Wait, another angle: perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is the hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. So, for example, X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, upon hydrolysis with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But then, in that case, the product would be option C, which is an option. So perhaps that's the case.

But looking at the NMR data, if X is an ester, the NMR would show an ester oxygen, which would cause a shift in the aromatic protons. But I don't see any peaks that would indicate an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester's carbonyl would show up at a different IR peak, but the given IR has a 1720 peak, which could fit an ester.

Wait, but if X is an ester, the NMR would show a triplet for the methylene group adjacent to the ester oxygen. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH, and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3. So maybe that fits a sec-butyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think I'll have to make a best guess here.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data to deduce the structure of X.

### IR Data Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

### NMR Data Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid -OH proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet likely corresponding to a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for a CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structural Deduction:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent containing a carbonyl group and a branched alkyl chain. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm and the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The substituent on the benzene ring is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the NMR signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH₂), 1.4 ppm (CH₃), and 0.9 ppm (CH₂CH₃).

Thus, compound X is deduced to be **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis reactions. However, since X is already a carboxylic acid, no further hydrolysis is expected. The reaction conditions do not appear to alter the carboxylic acid group or the benzene ring. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as it does not match the substituent pattern or the reaction conditions.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it lacks the carboxylic acid group present in X.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the structure of X and the reaction conditions do not change it.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it lacks the carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
