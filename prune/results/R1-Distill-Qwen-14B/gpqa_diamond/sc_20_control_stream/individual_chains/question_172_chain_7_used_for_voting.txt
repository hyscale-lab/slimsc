Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me read it again. So, two stars, star_1 and star_2. Iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE holds.

Wait, LTE is local thermodynamic equilibrium, right? So the conditions in the photosphere are such that the distribution of energy levels follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

I remember that the number of particles in an energy state is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

In this problem, the iron atoms' energy levels are excited. So, the excitation here is about the occupation of a specific higher energy level compared to a lower one. Let's say the energy levels are E1 (ground) and E2 (excited). The problem states that the number of excited atoms (in E2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So, the population in the specific energy level is twice as much. So, N2_1 is twice N2_2. Because star_1 has twice the excitation compared to star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The excitation level is the number of atoms in a higher energy state. So, let's denote N as the number of atoms in the excited state. For star_1, N1 = 2 * N2 (where N2 is the number for star_2).

But wait, the question states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level". So, maybe their excitation is higher, so the ratio is N1/N2 = 2.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's the excitation energy that's twice as much, but that doesn't quite make sense. No, probably it's the population in the excited state.

So, the ratio N1/N2 = 2.

But wait, wait. Another point: the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So, E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

But for the Boltzmann factor, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k*T). So, the ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), assuming g2 and g1 are the degeneracies.

Wait, or is it N2/N1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )? Because sometimes people set g=1 for both levels, and then the ratio would just be based on the exponential.

Wait, the question doesn't mention anything about the statistical weights, so perhaps we can assume they are the same for both levels? That would simplify things. So g2/g1 = 1.

Thus, the ratio N2/N1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming N2 is the number in the higher energy level.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps N is the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let me think.

Let me denote N_i as the number of atoms in the excited state for star i. Then, the ratio N1/N2 = 2. Because star 1 has twice as many atoms in that higher energy level as star 2.

So, N1/N2 = 2 = [ (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T2) ) ) ]

Wait, no. Because the formula is N_i (excited) / N_i (ground) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T_i) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The ratio between the two levels is N_upper / N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) )

But if the ground state is E_lower and excited state is E_upper, then the ratio is N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) )

But if the energy levels are the same for both stars, the g factors are the same, so ratio N_upper/N_lower is exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) )

But in the problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

So, for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is:

(N2/N1)_star_i = exp( - delta E / (k T_i) )

Wait, but wait, let me clarify: for star 1, the ratio is N1_upper/N1_lower = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: N2_upper/N2_lower = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

But in the problem, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no. The question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe it's the excitation (i.e., the number in the excited state) relative to the total number. But perhaps the question is about the ratio between the two stars for the same energy level.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is N_upper, star1 / N_upper, star2 = 2. So, (N1_upper)/(N2_upper) ) = 2.

But wait, that would be if the excited states are twice as populated in star 1. But if both stars are in LTE, then each star's N_upper is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1, N1_upper = N1_0 * exp( - delta E/(k T1) ), and for star 2, N2_upper = N2_0 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) ). But I'm not sure about the relation between N1_0 and N2_0. Wait, the total number of iron atoms in each photosphere might differ, but perhaps in this problem, the ratio of the excited populations is given.

Wait, but the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper.

But the question may be considering the ratio of the excited to the total number of atoms, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the number of excited atoms is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, the ratio N1_upper / N2_upper = exp( (delta E/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me think again.

Assume that N_i (upper) = N_i (lower) * exp( - delta E/(k T_i) )

But the ratio N_upper for star 1 to N_upper for star 2 is 2. So,

N1_upper / N2_upper = 2

But each N_upper is given by N_i (total) * (g_upper / g_total) * exp( - delta E/(k T_i) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the ratio of the excitation for the two stars.

The excitation is in a specific energy level, so I'll consider the ratio of the populations in that level. Let me denote the ratio as N1/N2 = 2.

But each N is proportional to the Boltzmann factor for that star. So,

N1/N2 = exp( - (delta E)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (delta E)/(k T2) )

Because N is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, and assuming g is the same for both stars (same element, same level), so the g cancels out.

So,

N1/N2 = exp( (delta E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no: the exponent becomes [ (-delta E)/(k T1) ) - ( - delta E/(k T2) ) ] = delta E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So,

N1/N2 = exp( (delta E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Set this equal to 2.

So,

2 = exp( (delta E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln 2 = (delta E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, let's rearrange that.

ln 2 = (delta E / k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln 2 = (delta E / k ) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So, let's write this as:

ln 2 = ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) * (delta E / k )

But the question gives delta E as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, 1.38e-23 J is a small energy, but that's probably to be used in the equation.

But the question is about the form of the equation relating T1 and T2. So, looking at the options, which one matches this structure.

Wait, the options are all in terms of ln(2) equals an expression involving T1 and T2. Let's see.

The equation I have is:

ln 2 = [ (delta E) (T1 - T2) ) / (k T1 T2) ) ]

But looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2) ]

Hmm, that's similar, but without the delta E and k factors. So perhaps the question is assuming that  (delta E /k ) = 1. Let me check delta E and k.

Wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J. What's the value of k?

Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta E is exactly 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k * (some temperature T?), but let's see:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, delta E = 1.38e-23 J = k * (something). Let me compute that something:

delta E = k * T => T = delta E / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So delta E = k * 1 K.

So delta E /k = 1 K.

So, delta E /k = 1.

So, going back to the equation:

ln 2 = (1) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln 2 = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln 2 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, that's the correct equation.

To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars, we analyze the given information and apply the Boltzmann distribution. The problem states that the number of iron atoms in a specific excited energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, and the energy difference between the two levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming LTE holds, the ratio of the populations of the excited and ground states is given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{excited}}}{N_{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the excited populations is:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = 2 = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying this ratio:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
