Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star and some changes when it has spots. The key points I see are:

- The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses.
- When the surface isn't covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K.
- When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.
- They're looking at the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots.
- The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å.
- The photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

The question is asking by what factor the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So, the ratio when no spots is R1, and when spots are present is R2. They're asking for R1/R2.

Hmm, wait, no, wait. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So when there's no spots, the ratio is higher. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots). So the factor would be R1/R2.

Now, what determines the ratio of two energy levels in LTE? Oh right, it's the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies, E2>E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

So, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

But here, the question is about the ratio of Ti in two levels. Let's call them level 1 and level 2. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K. So without spots, higher temperature, higher ratio.

Wait, but the exact effect depends on whether level 2 is higher or lower in energy. Because if level 2 is higher, then when temperature increases, more atoms can be excited to level 2, so n2 increases, so n2/n1 increases. So the ratio would be higher at higher temperatures.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K). The ratio decreases, so in that case, n2/n1 is lower. So that aligns with the idea that the ratio is higher at higher temperatures.

So the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. So the factor by which the ratio changes would be the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures.

Wait, but wait—the effective temperature is changing because of the spots. But the photosphere's temperature is what's relevant for the line formation? Or is it the local temperature where the line forms?

Wait, the star's overall Teff is lower when spots are present. But the spots are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff is lower, but the photosphere (the unspotted regions) have higher temperature, and the spots have lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, no, the question says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

But when the star has spots, the photosphere's overall effective temperature is 5500 K. But the spots themselves might be even cooler, but for the purpose of this problem, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature is lower, so we're to compute the ratio at 6000 K and compare to 5500 K.

Wait, but is the photosphere's temperature the same everywhere? Or are the spots cooler regions and the rest of the photosphere at 6000 K? Hmm, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the average temperature is 5500 K, implying that the total flux is lower.

But for the purposes of the line formation, if the line forms in a region where the temperature is 6000 K (unspotted areas) and 5500 K (spots), but when spots are present, the observed line is a combination of both regions. But wait, the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps when the star has spots, the photosphere's temperature is lower, meaning that the line is formed in an average temperature of 5500 K, or perhaps a mix of regions at different temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be the case because the overall Teff is an average of the different regions.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as two regions: the spotted and unspotted regions. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not make sense, because the unspotted regions would be at 6000 K, but the spots would be cooler.

Wait, the question says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average effective temperature is lower. But each part of the surface (spotted and unspotted) has its own temperature.

So the unspotted 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, the spotted 40% is at a lower temperature. Let's call the spot temperature T_spot.

The effective temperature is the area-weighted average of the flux from each region. The flux from a star is sigma * T^4. So the overall Teff^4 is the area-weighted average of the fluxes from each region.

So, Teff_total^4 = (0.6 * sigma * T_unspotted^4) + (0.4 * sigma * T_spot^4) ) / (0.6 + 0.4)

Wait, no, the effective temperature is such that sigma * Teff_total^4 = (0.6 sigma T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 sigma T_spot^4 ) / (1), because the area is 100% (the whole star). So:

Teff_total^4 = 0.6 T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4.

Given that when the star has spots, Teff_total is 5500 K. When no spots, Teff is 6000 K (so T_unspotted is 6000 K).

So when spots are present:

5500^4 = 0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

We can solve for T_spot.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere. So the line is emitted from regions with different temperatures. So when spots are present, the photosphere has both 6000 K (unspotted) and T_spot (spotted) regions. The line would be a blend of the two.

But the problem states that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So perhaps the observed line is a combination of both regions.

Alternatively, maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is lower, so the line is formed in regions that are cooler on average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by considering that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, but that's not accurate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the line is formed in the regions where the temperature is lower because of the spots, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, the line is formed in the unspotted regions, which are at 6000 K, but when spots cover part of the surface, the contribution from the spots (which are cooler) affects the overall line profile.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous. However, looking back, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the line is formed in a region that's on average 5500 K, but that might not be correct because the line is formed in the photosphere, which has regions at 6000 K and T_spot.

But considering the problem statement, perhaps the question simplifies things, and we can model the line as being formed in a photosphere with an average temperature of 5500 K when spots are present and 6000 K otherwise.

But perhaps that's the way to approach it. So if I can find the ratio of the populations at 6000 K and 5500 K, and calculate the ratio of those ratios, that would give me the factor.

Wait, but the line is formed in the photosphere, which when spotted has both 6000 K and lower T regions. So the line would be a sum of contributions from different regions. But if the line is formed in LTE, the populations in each region are determined by their local temperature.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. So if the line is formed in regions of different temperatures, the observed ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the observed ratio would depend on the flux from each region. Because the flux from a region is proportional to its area and the Planck function at the wavelength in question. So the observed equivalent width or the line strength would be a combination of the contributions from each region.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which is an approximation. So the ratio would be determined by 5500 K and 6000 K.

So let's model it that way. So when there are no spots, the temperature is 6000 K. When spots are present, the temperature is 5500 K.

The ratio of Ti in levels 1 and 2 is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, wait. The ratio n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), but wait, according to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations is (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Wait, no, let me correct. Let me define E1 as the energy of level 1, E2 as energy of level 2, with E2 > E1.

The number of atoms in level 2 is n2 = (g2 / g1) * n1 * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But in the problem, the ratio of Ti in levels 1 and 2 is being considered. So the question is about n1/n2 or n2/n1?

Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T decreases, what happens?

Well, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Wait, n2 = (g2/g1) n1 exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases because denominator is bigger. So n1/n2 decreases with increasing T.

Wait, suppose T increases. Let's say ΔE is positive. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ). As T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. So if the temperature increases, n1/n2 decreases, which means n2/n1 increases.

So when the star is hotter (no spots, 6000 K), n2/n1 is higher, and when it's cooler (spots, 5500 K), n2/n1 is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower, which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, no, wait:

Wait the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T decreases, the ratio would be higher. Because as T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, hence n1/n2 increases.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

So when T is higher, the exponent is more negative, so the exponential is smaller. So n2/n1 is lower when T is higher.

Wait, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So at higher T, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is smaller, so n2/n1 is smaller.

So when the star is hotter (6000 K), n2/n1 is smaller. When the star is cooler (5500 K), n2/n1 is larger.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, no, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. So perhaps the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait, let me read the question again:

"...the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, the ratio is (n1)/(n2), and it's lower when the star has spots. So with spots, (n1/n2) is lower.

Wait, let's compute (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp increases, so (n1/n2) increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That's a contradiction. Hmm, so perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2)/(n1), and it's decreasing when the star has spots. Because when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, as we saw earlier.

So with spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower. So the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots.

So the problem is probably referring to the ratio (n2/n1), which decreases when the star has spots. Because when T is lower, n2/n1 is lower.

Wait, that makes sense. So the ratio n2/n1 is larger at higher temperatures. So when the star has spots, and the temperature drops, the ratio n2/n1 decreases.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Which is [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel out. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) * [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(6000) - 1/(5500) ) ] = ΔE/(k) * [ (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ]

Wait, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(6000 *5500)

So the exponent becomes:

ΔE/(k) * ( -500 ) / (6000 *5500 )

Which is:

- (ΔE *500 ) / (k *6000 *5500 )

So factor = exp( (ΔE *500 ) / (k *6000 *5500 ) )

Wait, because it's multiplied by the negative, but then the factor is exp( positive value )

Wait, no, let's retrace:

n2/n1 at T1=6000: A = exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )

n2/n1 at T2=5500: B = exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

So the factor is A/B = exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Which is the same as:

exp( ΔE/(k) [ (6000 -5500 ) / (5500 *6000) ] )

So:

exp( ΔE/(k) * 500/(5500 *6000) )

So the exponent is:

(ΔE) * 500 / (k *5500 *6000 )

So we need to compute this exponent.

But we don't know ΔE. Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE can be found from the photon energy.

Photon energy E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

ΔE = hc/λ.

So, let's compute ΔE/(k) because that's what we need.

Compute:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )

= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m )

= approx 1.372e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann constant k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈  (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5 K.

Wait, 1e5 is 10^5, which is 100,000 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So, putting this into the exponent:

exponent = (1e5 K) * (500) / (5500 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 5500 *6000 = 3.3e7.

So,

exponent = (1e5) *500 / (3.3e7) = (5e7) / (3.3e7) ≈ ~1.515.

So exponent ≈ 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515 ≈ ~4.54.

Wait, because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.515 is a bit higher, approximately 4.54.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's compute the exponent more accurately.

Compute (ΔE)/(k)= (hc/(λ k)).

h=6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

λ=1448e-10 m

k=1.38e-23 J/K

So,

ΔE/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m *1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-10 *1.38e-23 = (1448 * 1.38 )e-33 = appr 1994.24e-33 = 1.99424e-30 J·m/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.99424e-30) ) ≈ (1.9878 /1.99424 )e5 ≈ approx 0.997e5 ≈ 99700 K.

So, roughly 99700 K.

Then, the exponent is:

(99700) * (500) / (5500 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 5500 *6000 = 33e6.

So,

exponent = (99700 *500) / 33e6 = (49,850,000) / 33,000,000 ≈ 1.509.

So exponent ≈1.509.

e^1.509 ≈ let's compute that.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.009 is about 1.00905.

So, 4.4817 * 1.00905 ≈ approx 4.52.

So the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_2/n_1\) is the ratio of populations in two energy levels, \(g_2/g_1\) is the ratio of degeneracies, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The ratio \(n_2/n_1\) decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the temperature drop reduces the population of the higher energy level (\(n_2\)) relative to the lower energy level (\(n_1\)).
2. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so the energy difference \(\Delta E\) can be calculated using the photon energy formula:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength.

### Calculations:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**
   Using \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Ratio of Energy to Boltzmann Constant (\(\Delta E / k\)):**
   Using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99700 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. **Exponent in the Boltzmann Factor:**
   The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(\Delta E / k \approx 99700 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(99700 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right)
   \]
   Compute the term inside the exponential:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \cdot 5500} = \frac{-500}{33 \times 10^6} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99700 \cdot (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.509
   \]
   The factor becomes:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.509) \approx 4.52
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from no spots (6000 K) to having spots (5500 K). This matches option **C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star and some changes when it has spots. The key points I see are:

- The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses.
- When the surface isn't covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K.
- When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.
- They're looking at the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots.
- The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å.
- The photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

The question is asking by what factor the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So, the ratio when no spots is R1, and when spots are present is R2. They're asking for R1/R2.

Hmm, wait, no, wait. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So when there's no spots, the ratio is higher. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots). So the factor would be R1/R2.

Now, what determines the ratio of two energy levels in LTE? Oh right, it's the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies, E2>E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

So, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

But here, the question is about the ratio of Ti in two levels. Let's call them level 1 and level 2. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K. So without spots, higher temperature, higher ratio.

Wait, but the exact effect depends on whether level 2 is higher or lower in energy. Because if level 2 is higher, then when temperature increases, more atoms can be excited to level 2, so n2 increases, so n2/n1 increases. So the ratio would be higher at higher temperatures.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K). The ratio decreases, so in that case, n2/n1 is lower. So that aligns with the idea that the ratio is higher at higher temperatures.

So the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. So the factor by which the ratio changes would be the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures.

Wait, but wait—the effective temperature is changing because of the spots. But the photosphere's temperature is what's relevant for the line formation? Or is it the local temperature where the line forms?

Wait, the star's overall Teff is lower when spots are present. But the spots are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff is lower, but the photosphere (the unspotted regions) have higher temperature, and the spots have lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, no, the question says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

But when the star has spots, the photosphere's overall effective temperature is 5500 K. But the spots themselves might be even cooler, but for the purpose of this problem, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature is lower, so we're to compute the ratio at 6000 K and compare to 5500 K.

Wait, but is the photosphere's temperature the same everywhere? Or are the spots cooler regions and the rest of the photosphere at 6000 K? Hmm, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the average temperature is 5500 K, implying that the total flux is lower.

But for the purposes of the line formation, if the line forms in a region where the temperature is 6000 K (unspotted areas) and 5500 K (spots), but when spots are present, the observed line is a combination of both regions. But wait, the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps when the star has spots, the photosphere's temperature is lower, meaning that the line is formed in an average temperature of 5500 K, or perhaps a mix of regions at different temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be the case because the overall Teff is an average of the different regions.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as two regions: the spotted and unspotted regions. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not make sense, because the unspotted regions would be at 6000 K, but the spots would be cooler.

Wait, the question says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average effective temperature is lower. But each part of the surface (spotted and unspotted) has its own temperature.

So the unspotted 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, the spotted 40% is at a lower temperature. Let's call the spot temperature T_spot.

The effective temperature is the area-weighted average of the flux from each region. The flux from a star is sigma * T^4. So the overall Teff^4 is the area-weighted average of the fluxes from each region.

So, Teff_total^4 = (0.6 * sigma * T_unspotted^4) + (0.4 * sigma * T_spot^4) ) / (0.6 + 0.4)

Wait, no, the effective temperature is such that sigma * Teff_total^4 = (0.6 sigma T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 sigma T_spot^4 ) / (1), because the area is 100% (the whole star). So:

Teff_total^4 = 0.6 T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4.

Given that when the star has spots, Teff_total is 5500 K. When no spots, Teff is 6000 K (so T_unspotted is 6000 K).

So when spots are present:

5500^4 = 0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

We can solve for T_spot.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere. So the line is emitted from regions with different temperatures. So when spots are present, the photosphere has both 6000 K (unspotted) and T_spot (spotted) regions. The line would be a blend of the two.

But the problem states that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So perhaps the observed line is a combination of both regions.

Alternatively, maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is lower, so the line is formed in regions that are cooler on average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by considering that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, but that's not accurate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the line is formed in the regions where the temperature is lower because of the spots, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, the line is formed in the unspotted regions, which are at 6000 K, but when spots cover part of the surface, the contribution from the spots (which are cooler) affects the overall line profile.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous. However, looking back, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the line is formed in a region that's on average 5500 K, but that might not be correct because the line is formed in the photosphere, which has regions at 6000 K and T_spot.

But considering the problem statement, perhaps the question simplifies things, and we can model the line as being formed in a photosphere with an average temperature of 5500 K when spots are present and 6000 K otherwise.

But perhaps that's the way to approach it. So if I can find the ratio of the populations at 6000 K and 5500 K, and calculate the ratio of those ratios, that would give me the factor.

Wait, but the line is formed in the photosphere, which when spotted has both 6000 K and lower T regions. So the line would be a sum of contributions from different regions. But if the line is formed in LTE, the populations in each region are determined by their local temperature.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. So if the line is formed in regions of different temperatures, the observed ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the observed ratio would depend on the flux from each region. Because the flux from a region is proportional to its area and the Planck function at the wavelength in question. So the observed equivalent width or the line strength would be a combination of the contributions from each region.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which is an approximation. So the ratio would be determined by 5500 K and 6000 K.

So let's model it that way. So when there are no spots, the temperature is 6000 K. When spots are present, the temperature is 5500 K.

The ratio of Ti in levels 1 and 2 is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, wait. The ratio n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), but wait, according to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations is (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Wait, no, let me correct. Let me define E1 as the energy of level 1, E2 as energy of level 2, with E2 > E1.

The number of atoms in level 2 is n2 = (g2 / g1) * n1 * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But in the problem, the ratio of Ti in levels 1 and 2 is being considered. So the question is about n1/n2 or n2/n1?

Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T decreases, what happens?

Well, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Wait, n2 = (g2/g1) n1 exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases because denominator is bigger. So n1/n2 decreases with increasing T.

Wait, suppose T increases. Let's say ΔE is positive. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ). As T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. So if the temperature increases, n1/n2 decreases, which means n2/n1 increases.

So when the star is hotter (no spots, 6000 K), n2/n1 is higher, and when it's cooler (spots, 5500 K), n2/n1 is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower, which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, no, wait:

Wait the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T decreases, the ratio would be higher. Because as T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, hence n1/n2 increases.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

So when T is higher, the exponent is more negative, so the exponential is smaller. So n2/n1 is lower when T is higher.

Wait, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So at higher T, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is smaller, so n2/n1 is smaller.

So when the star is hotter (6000 K), n2/n1 is smaller. When the star is cooler (5500 K), n2/n1 is larger.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, no, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. So perhaps the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait, let me read the question again:

"...the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, the ratio is (n1)/(n2), and it's lower when the star has spots. So with spots, (n1/n2) is lower.

Wait, let's compute (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp increases, so (n1/n2) increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That's a contradiction. Hmm, so perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2)/(n1), and it's decreasing when the star has spots. Because when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, as we saw earlier.

So with spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower. So the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots.

So the problem is probably referring to the ratio (n2/n1), which decreases when the star has spots. Because when T is lower, n2/n1 is lower.

Wait, that makes sense. So the ratio n2/n1 is larger at higher temperatures. So when the star has spots, and the temperature drops, the ratio n2/n1 decreases.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Which is [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel out. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) * [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(6000) - 1/(5500) ) ] = ΔE/(k) * [ (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ]

Wait, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(6000 *5500)

So the exponent becomes:

ΔE/(k) * ( -500 ) / (6000 *5500 )

Which is:

- (ΔE *500 ) / (k *6000 *5500 )

So factor = exp( (ΔE *500 ) / (k *6000 *5500 ) )

Wait, because it's multiplied by the negative, but then the factor is exp( positive value )

Wait, no, let's retrace:

n2/n1 at T1=6000: A = exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )

n2/n1 at T2=5500: B = exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

So the factor is A/B = exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Which is the same as:

exp( ΔE/(k) [ (6000 -5500 ) / (5500 *6000) ] )

So:

exp( ΔE/(k) * 500/(5500 *6000) )

So the exponent is:

(ΔE) * 500 / (k *5500 *6000 )

So we need to compute this exponent.

But we don't know ΔE. Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE can be found from the photon energy.

Photon energy E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

ΔE = hc/λ.

So, let's compute ΔE/(k) because that's what we need.

Compute:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )

= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m )

= approx 1.372e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann constant k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈  (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5 K.

Wait, 1e5 is 10^5, which is 100,000 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So, putting this into the exponent:

exponent = (1e5 K) * (500) / (5500 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 5500 *6000 = 3.3e7.

So,

exponent = (1e5) *500 / (3.3e7) = (5e7) / (3.3e7) ≈ ~1.515.

So exponent ≈ 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515 ≈ ~4.54.

Wait, because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.515 is a bit higher, approximately 4.54.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's compute the exponent more accurately.

Compute (ΔE)/(k)= (hc/(λ k)).

h=6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

λ=1448e-10 m

k=1.38e-23 J/K

So,

ΔE/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m *1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-10 *1.38e-23 = (1448 * 1.38 )e-33 = appr 1994.24e-33 = 1.99424e-30 J·m/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.99424e-30) ) ≈ (1.9878 /1.99424 )e5 ≈ approx 0.997e5 ≈ 99700 K.

So, roughly 99700 K.

Then, the exponent is:

(99700) * (500) / (5500 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 5500 *6000 = 33e6.

So,

exponent = (99700 *500) / 33e6 = (49,850,000) / 33,000,000 ≈ 1.509.

So exponent ≈1.509.

e^1.509 ≈ let's compute that.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.009 is about 1.00905.

So, 4.4817 * 1.00905 ≈ approx 4.52.

So the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_2/n_1\) is the ratio of populations in two energy levels, \(g_2/g_1\) is the ratio of degeneracies, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The ratio \(n_2/n_1\) decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the temperature drop reduces the population of the higher energy level (\(n_2\)) relative to the lower energy level (\(n_1\)).
2. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so the energy difference \(\Delta E\) can be calculated using the photon energy formula:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength.

### Calculations:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**
   Using \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Ratio of Energy to Boltzmann Constant (\(\Delta E / k\)):**
   Using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99700 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. **Exponent in the Boltzmann Factor:**
   The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(\Delta E / k \approx 99700 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(99700 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right)
   \]
   Compute the term inside the exponential:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \cdot 5500} = \frac{-500}{33 \times 10^6} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99700 \cdot (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.509
   \]
   The factor becomes:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.509) \approx 4.52
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from no spots (6000 K) to having spots (5500 K). This matches option **C**.

Answer: C
