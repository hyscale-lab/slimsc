Okay, so I have this astronomy question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spotted hemispheres and how that affects its brightness variations, comparing it to an exoplanet's effect. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

So, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, right? So Rstar is R_sun. The effective temperature is 6000 K, which is a bit hotter than our Sun, which is around 5778 K. But not a big difference, I guess. Now, one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Oh wait, wait. Filling factor of 20%—that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the area of one hemisphere.

Each spot is cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000. Or wait, maybe the temperature difference is 1000 K cooler? So T_spot = 5000 K.

The question says that the photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots in and out of view. But this situation is similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the brightness would dip a bit, similar to a planet blocking light.

But in this case, the problem is asking: what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do? So if the star wasn't spotted, what planet size would cause the same dip.

So I need to find Rplanet / Rstar such that the dip (the change in brightness) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, let me get the setup right. The star's brightness variation due to spots is due to the spots being cooler. When the spots come into view, the total brightness decreases because those areas are emitting less light.

So the flux from the star without spots is F0. When a spot is visible, the flux is F0 - delta_F, where delta_F is the difference from the spot area.

Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The blocked flux is F_blocked = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0. So the dip is delta_F_planet = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * F0.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the delta_F_spot is the difference between the normal flux from those areas and the flux from the spots. So let me think about that.

The flux from a star is proportional to the surface area times the temperature^4 (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). So each spot has a lower flux. So the total flux from the star is F_total = 4π Rstar^2 * sigma * Teff^4 * (1 - f) + 4π Rspot^2 * sigma * Tspot^4 * f.

Wait, but wait. The spots are on a hemisphere. So the total area of the hemisphere is 2π Rstar^2. The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar^2. Or wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface? No, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So it's 20% of the hemisphere's area.

So the area of the spot is 0.2 * (2 π Rstar²). But wait, if the hemisphere is 2π steradians, then 20% of that is 0.4 π Rstar². Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of fractions.

The total flux when the spot is facing us is F_total = F_normal - F_spot + F_spot_cooler.

Wait no, the star's normal flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (surface area) / 4? Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the star's total flux without spots as F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * (4 pi Rstar²) * (1/4 pi) )? Wait, no. The flux from a star is F = sigma T^4. But wait, that's the power per unit area. The total luminosity is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4. So the total flux from the star is L / (4 pi D^2), but when considering the star's own flux, I think I need to model the flux from the unspotted and spotted areas.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible. Let's think in terms of the brightness variation amplitude.

The star's brightness without spots would have a certain flux. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases because those spots emit less. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the spots and the difference in their brightness compared to the rest.

So the fractional dip (delta_F / F0) when the spots are fully visible is:

delta_F = (Area_spot / Area_star) * (sigma T_spot^4 - sigma T_star^4).

So the fractional change is (delta_F) / F0 = (A_spot / A_total) (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4.

Wait, no, because F0 is sigma T_star^4 times the surface area. So (delta_F) = (A_spot) * (sigma T_spot^4 - sigma T_star^4).

But F0 = sigma T_star^4 * A_total.

So delta_F / F0 = (A_spot / A_total) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) / T_star^4.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) is negative, so delta_F is negative. So the fractional dip is (A_spot / A_total) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 - 1).

Wait, but I'm looking for the fractional brightness change. So when the spots are viewed, the brightness decreases by delta_F. So the dip is delta_F / F0 = (A_spot / A_total) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) / T_star^4.

But since T_spot is less than T_star, the term (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) is negative. So the fractional dip is negative, which makes sense because the brightness decreases.

But when considering the amplitude of the variation, the absolute value is what matters. So the amplitude of the dip would be the maximum fractional change, which is (A_spot / A_total) * (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) / T_star^4.

Wait, in the case of the planet transit, the dip is simply (R_p / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's disk, so the area blocked is (pi R_p^2) / (pi R_star^2) ) = (R_p / R_star)^2.

So the question is, we need (R_p / R_star)^2 to equal the fractional dip caused by the spots. Because the amplitude of the dip for the planet is (R_p/R_star)^2, and the amplitude for the spots is [ (A_spot / A_total) * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) ] / Teff^4.

So I need to calculate the fractional dip from the spots, set it equal to (R_p/R_star)^2, and solve for R_p/R_star.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4): (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

0.8333^4: let me compute that.

0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Then 0.6944^2 is approximately 0.48225.

So 0.48225 is (5/6)^4.

So the fractional dip from the spots is:

delta_fraction = (A_spot / A_total) * (1 - (5/6)^4) )

What's (A_spot / A_total)?

The spots are on one hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. But the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

So A_spot = 0.2 * (2 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi Rstar^2) ) * something?

Wait, A_total = 4 pi Rstar^2, the star's total surface area.

A_hemisphere = 2 pi Rstar^2.

Filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so A_spot = 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So A_spot / A_total = (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2 ) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

Ah, so the area ratio is 0.1.

So delta_fraction = 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225 ) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

So the fractional dip caused by the spots is approximately 5.1775% when the spots are fully visible.

Now, the planet's dip is (R_p/Rstar)^2.

Set them equal:

(R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Take square root: R_p/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, that's about 0.228. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32, option C is ~0.11, option A is ~0.39, option B is ~0.07.

Hmm, none of the options are near 0.227. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, the area of the spot: Filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere. So hemisphere area is 2 pi R^2. 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. So A_spot is 0.4 pi R^2.

A_total is 4 pi R^2.

So A_spot / A_total = (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1. That seems correct.

Then, T_spot^4 / T_eff^4: (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 is 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, so fractional dip is ~0.051775 or 5.1775%.

So the planet's dip should be the same: (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775, so R_p ~ sqrt(0.051775) = approx 0.2275, which is about 0.228.

But the options are A) 0.39, B)0.07, C)0.11, D)0.32.

Hmm, none of them are near 0.228. Did I make an error in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I confused the area. Let's think again.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, Rstar = R_sun.

When a planet transits, the area blocked is a circle with radius R_planet. So the area is pi R_p^2. The star's area is pi R_star^2. So the ratio is (R_p/Rstar)^2.

Wait, no, no, the star's disk area is pi Rstar^2, but the area of the planet is pi R_p^2. So the blocked fraction is (R_p^2)/(Rstar^2) = (R_p/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but if the spot covers a certain area, the dip is proportional to the area of the spot multiplied by the factor of how much less flux it emits compared to the rest.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the star emits more flux from the hotter regions. So the fractional dip when the spots are visible is the area times (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4, all divided by the total area.

Ah, but wait, perhaps I should have considered that the star's unspotted area is (1 - filling factor) in each hemisphere.

Wait, no, the star's total flux is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is (unspotted flux) + (spotted flux). The unspotted flux is (1 - 0.2) * hemisphere area, and the spotted is 0.2 * hemisphere area.

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the total flux is the sum of all the areas. So when the spots are visible (on the front hemisphere), the flux is F = (unspotted area * T_eff^4) + (spotted area * T_spot^4).

The total flux without spots would be F0 = (hemisphere area * T_eff^4) + (hemisphere area * T_eff^4) ) = 2 * hemisphere area * T_eff^4.

Wait, but when the spots are present, the front hemisphere has (0.8 * hemisphere area) at T_eff and 0.2 * hemisphere area at T_spot.

So the flux when spots are visible is F = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4) + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4) ) / (4 pi R^2) )? Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire star.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the flux with spots to the flux without spots.

Flux without spots (F0) is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Flux with spots (F) is [ (1 - 0.1) * Teff^4 + 0.1 * T_spot^4 ] * sigma * 4 pi R^2 * (1/4 pi) )?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to compute the ratio of the fluxes.

The ratio F_spot / F0 is [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] / Teff^4, where f is the filling factor over the entire visible hemisphere.

Wait, f is 0.2 for the hemisphere, so when the spot is on the front, the visible area is 0.2 of the hemisphere. But the hemisphere is half the star's surface.

Wait, maybe think about it differently. The fraction of the star's surface that is in spots, when the spots are facing us, is (0.2 * (hemisphere area) ) / (total area).

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R^2. So 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

Total area is 4 pi R^2.

So the fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, as I did before.

So the flux from the star when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - 0.1) * (Teff^4) + 0.1 * (T_spot^4) ) / Teff^4.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because F0 is the total flux without any spots. When spots are present, a fraction f of the star's surface is emitting at a lower flux (T_spot^4), so F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ].

So the relative flux is F / F0 = (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4).

So the fractional dip is [1 - (F / F0)] = f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) = f (1 - (5/6)^4 ).

Which is what I did earlier. So that would be 0.1 (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775, or about 5.1775% dip.

So the planet would need to cause the same dip: (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have 0.2275. The closest is option D: 0.32 and option C: 0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Let me think again. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum dip occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us.

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the area of the spots as seen from Earth is just the area of the spots on the hemisphere. So when the spot is on the front, the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So when the spot is in view, the flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - 0.2) * (Teff^4) + 0.2 * (T_spot^4) ) ] / Teff^4.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because F0 is the total flux without any spots, which is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When spots are present on a hemisphere, the flux emitted is:

F = [ ( (1 - 0.2) * 2 pi R^2 ) * sigma Teff^4 + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 ) * sigma T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 )

Simplify that:

F = [ (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * Teff^4 ) + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * T_spot^4 ) ) ] / (4 pi R^2 )

The 2 pi R^2 factors cancel out, and 4 pi R^2 in the denominator becomes 2.

So F = [0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ] * (sigma 2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2) ? Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, F is the sum of flux from the unspotted and spotted areas.

Unspotted area: 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 → flux is 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4.

Spotted area: 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 → flux is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4.

Total flux when spots are visible: F = unspotted_flux + spotted_flux.

F = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 + 0.2 * 2 pi R^2) * sigma Teff^4 * [ (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the flux from the spotted area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4.

So F = [0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4] + [0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4 ].

The total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So F = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 + 0.2 * 2 pi R^2) * sigma Teff^4 * [ 1 - (0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (Teff^4) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I should compute F in terms of F0.

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When spots are visible, F = [ (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4) + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4) ) ].

Let me factor 2 pi R^2 sigma from both terms.

F = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ].

So F = 2 pi R^2 sigma * (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4).

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So the ratio F/F0 is [ (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2 pi R^2 sigma ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ].

Simplify:

The 2 pi R^2 sigma in numerator and 4 pi R^2 sigma in denominator gives 2/(4) = 0.5.

So F/F0 = 0.5 * (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

= 0.5 * [ 0.8 (Teff^4 / Teff^4 ) + 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

= 0.5 [ 0.8 + 0.2 ( (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

As before, (5000/6000)^4 is (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 0.5 [ 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.48225 ] = 0.5 [ 0.8 + 0.09645 ] = 0.5 * 0.89645 = 0.448225.

So F/F0 ≈ 0.448225.

Therefore, the relative brightness when spots are visible is 44.8225% of F0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the spots are visible, the brightness should decrease, not drop to 44.8%. Oh wait, wait, that's the ratio when the spots are visible. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when the star is unspotted, F0 is the total flux. When the spots are visible, F is less than F0.

Wait, but in our calculation, F = 0.448 F0? That can't be right because the spots only cover 10% of the star's area and are cooler, not completely dark.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the calculation.

We have:

F = [0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4 + 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4 ].

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So F = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 + 0.2 * 2 pi R^2) * sigma Teff^4 * (0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write F = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4) + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4) = 2 pi R^2 sigma [0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4].

F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So F/F0 = [2 pi R^2 sigma (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4)] / [4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4] = [ (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2 ] / [4 Teff^4 ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) * 2 ] /4.

= [ (0.8 + 0.2 * 0.48225 ) * 2 ] /4.

= [ (0.8 + 0.09645 ) * 2 ] /4.

= (0.89645 * 2) /4.

= 1.7929 /4 ≈ 0.4482.

Wait, so F is 44.82% of F0 when the spots are visible. That would mean the star's brightness drops to 44.8% of its normal value, which is a huge dip. That's impossible because the spots only cover 10% of the area. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a second, I think I messed up the ratio. Let me think again.

The correct approach is to compute the flux when the spots are visible and compare it to the flux when the spots are not visible.

When the spots are not visible, the flux is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (1 - 0.1) * 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ] + [ 0.1 * 4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ].

Wait, but wait, no. Because the filling factor is 0.1 of the entire star. Because when the spots are on one hemisphere, the total area of spots is 0.1 of the total area.

So F = (1 - 0.1) * F0 + 0.1 * (sigma T_spot^4 * 4 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) * sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because F0 is (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ). When 10% of the surface is at T_spot, the flux is F = (0.9 * Teff^4 ) * 4 pi R^2 sigma + (0.1 * T_spot^4 ) * 4 pi R^2 sigma.

So F = 4 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.9 Teff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ].

Thus, the flux when the spots are visible is F = 4 pi R^2 sigma (0.9 Teff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ).

So the ratio F / F0 = [0.9 Teff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ] / Teff^4.

Which simplifies to 0.9 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ).

Ah, that's better. So this is the correct ratio.

So F / F0 = 0.9 + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4.

Compute (5000/6000)^4: (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So F/F0 = 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.9 + 0.048225 = 0.948225.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is 94.8225% of F0. So the fractional dip is 1 - 0.948225 = 0.051775, or 5.1775% as I calculated before.

So that part was correct.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0, which is the same as (R_p/Rstar)^2.

So R_p/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is not just when the spots are fully visible, but due to rotational modulation. Hmm, but the question says: "the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K."

But the way the problem is set up, when the spots are on the near side, the brightness is lower, and when they are on the far side, the brightness is higher. Wait, no, because the spots are cooler. So when spots are on the near side, the brightness is lower, and when they're on the far side, the brightness is higher.

Wait, but the problem states that the star is observed to have a brightness variation due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, that's a crucial point I might have missed. Earlier, I considered the dip when the spots are fully visible. But what's the total amplitude of the variation? It's the difference between when the spots are visible and when they are not.

So when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is maximum. Because all the spots are on the far side, so the near side is all at Teff.

So the maximum flux is F_max = F0.

The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. So F_min = F0 * [ (1 - 0.1) Teff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ] / Teff^4.

Which is the same as F_min = F0 * (0.9 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

As before, F_min = F0 * 0.948225.

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F0 * 100% = (1 - 0.948225) * 100% ≈ 5.1775%.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min divided by the average. But in this case, the average is F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: for a star with spots, the light curve varies as the spots rotate into and out of view.

The maximum flux is when no spots are visible (all the near side is unspotted). The minimum flux is when the spots are fully visible on the near side.

So the amplitude is F_max - F_min.

The F_max is F0.

F_min is 0.948225 F0.

So the amplitude is F0 - 0.948225 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

The amplitude is 5.1775% of F0.

So to produce the same amplitude, the planet's transit would cause a dip of 5.1775% of F0.

So the planet's dip is (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the planet's radius is a fraction of that. So R_p is, say, 0.2276 R_sun. But exoplanets are usually much smaller than that, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate the area of the planet relative to the area of the spot.

Wait, the planet's area when transiting is a circle with radius R_p, so area pi R_p^2. The star's area is pi Rstar^2. So the fraction is (R_p/Rstar)^2.

The spot's area is 0.1 of the star's area, and each spot is cooler, leading to a 5.1775% dip. So the planet's dip is same as the spot's dip. So R_p must be such that (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ~ 0.2276 Rstar.

But none of the options match. Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → about 0.39 Rstar

B) ~0.07 → 0.07 Rstar

C) ~0.11 → 0.11 Rstar

D) ~0.32 → 0.32 Rstar.

Hmm, none are 0.227, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not use the fractional dip but the total area of the spot. Because the spot's area is 0.1 of the star, and when it's transiting, the planet would need to cover the same area to produce the same dip.

Wait, but the dip caused by the spot is not just the area but the difference in brightness.

Wait, the planet causes a dip of (R_p/Rstar)^2, which is the area blocked.

The spot causes a dip of 0.051775, which is the fractional brightness change due to the lower flux from that area.

But wait, the planet causes a dip of (R_p/Rstar)^2. So to get the same amplitude, (R_p/Rstar)^2 must equal 0.051775.

Hmm, so R_p/Rstar is sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't considering the difference in temperature but just the area. Because in the planet's case, the dip is purely due to geometric area blocking, whereas the spot's dip is due to lower flux from that area.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation has an amplitude equal to the spot-induced dip, which is 0.051775.

Wait, is there a possibility that the star's variation amplitude is twice the dip I calculated? Because when the spots rotate in and out, the brightness varies between F_min and F_max. The amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the difference between max and min, not divided by two. Let me think: the average flux is (F_max + F_min)/2.

The amplitude is (F_max - F_min). So in this case, F_max is F0, F_min is 0.948225 F0.

Amplitude is F0 - 0.948225 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

So that's correct.

So the dip is 5.1775%.

So the planet must cause the same dip. So the planet's dip is (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Which gives R_p/Rstar = 0.2276, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is comparing the maximum dip. Let me recheck the question.

The question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)."

So the amplitude of the light curve is the same.

So perhaps the amplitude is defined as the peak-to-peak variation. So the peak-to-peak is 2 * (F0 - F_min). Because F_max is F0, and F_min is 0.948225 F0. So peak-to-peak is F0 - 0.948225 F0 = 0.051775 F0, same as before.

So planet's amplitude is (R_p/Rstar)^2. So same as before.

So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

The total area is 4 pi R^2.

So the fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. But perhaps the calculation should be done using T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation points to R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.227, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the entire area of the star, not just the hemisphere. So the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. But the question says that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%.

So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 more accurately.

5/6 = 0.8333333.

0.8333333^2 = 0.6944444.

0.694444^2 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

0.694444 * 0.694444.

Compute 0.69 * 0.69 = 0.4761.

0.004444 * 0.69 ≈ 0.00305.

0.69 * 0.004444 ≈ 0.00305.

0.004444 * 0.004444 ≈ 0.0000197.

So adding: 0.4761 + 0.00305 + 0.00305 + 0.0000197 ≈ approximately 0.4822197.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's flux is F0, and when the spots are visible, the flux is F_min = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4).

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) * F0.

Because f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

Wait, but F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So when f fraction is covered by spots, the flux is F = (1 - f) F0 + f * (sigma T_spot^4) * 4 pi R^2.

Wait, but that's not correct because 4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 is the luminosity if the entire star were at T_spot. Instead, the fractional part f is emitting at T_spot.

So the correct F is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F0 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4).

So F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ].

Thus, the dip is F0 - F = F0 [ 1 - ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ) ].

= F0 [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ].

So fractional dip is f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ).

Which is the same as I did before.

So, if the dip is 5.1775%, as before, then the planet's R_p/Rstar must be sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.227.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are given in Jupiter radii or Earth radii. Wait, no, the options are unitless, just R_p/Rstar.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the relative brightness change when the planet transits, not when the spot is transiting. Oh wait, no, the planet is transiting the star, so the dip is when the planet covers part of the star.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the variation in brightness due to the spots as an effect that is similar to a planet's transit, but the amplitude is the same as if it were a planet causing the dip.

So in that case, R_p/Rstar is 0.227, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me think again.

The star's radius is Rstar.

The planet's radius is Rp.

The area blocked is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * pi.

Wait, no, the area is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the fraction is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2).

So, to get the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the maximum dip but about the variation in brightness over time. But that doesn't change the amplitude, it just affects the shape.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Since the options don't have 0.227, perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the star's radius is the same as the Sun. So Rstar = R_sun.

The spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 0.2*2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

Wait, wait, the entire star's surface is 4 pi Rstar^2. So the spot area is 0.4 pi Rstar^2, which is 0.4 pi /4 pi = 0.1, so 10% of the star's area.

So the fractional area is 0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

= 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So that's correct.

So if the planet's dip is the same, R_p/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Which is not an option. The closest is option A) 0.39, which is way larger. Option D is 0.32, also larger. Option C is 0.11, which is smaller than 0.227.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. If that were the case, then f = 0.2.

So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

Then Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. That's option D.

Ah, so perhaps I misinterpreted the filling factor. The question says the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. But if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then f = 0.2.

In that case, the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322, which is option D.

So perhaps I misread the filling factor.

The question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the 20% is of the hemisphere. So f is 0.1 (10% of the entire star). But if it were 20% of the entire star, f=0.2, leading to option D.

But the question explicitly states that the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the correct f is 0.1.

Hmm, but this leads to no matching option. Unless I made a mistake in the initial problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done using the radius of the planet in Jupiter radii. But the options are unitless, so it's R_p/Rstar.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the dip is 5.1775%, what would the R_p/Rstar be. 0.2275.

Wait, perhaps the options are given as approximate, and the closest is option C) 0.11, but that's only about half of 0.227.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the planet's area as the same as the spot area.

Wait, the spot area is 0.1 of the star. So the planet's area would need to be 0.1 of the star's area to produce the same dip. So R_p/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is close to option D) 0.32.

Ah, that's an alternative approach. If the planet covers the same area as the spots, then the dip would be the same. But that's only true if the spots and planet have the same brightness as the star. But in reality, the spots are darker, so their effect is not just the area but also the temperature difference.

Wait, but the problem is saying that the brightness variation is the same. So perhaps the planet's area needs to be the same as the spot area, regardless of the temperature.

In that case, the dip from the planet is (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → R_p = sqrt(0.1) * Rstar ≈ 0.316 Rstar, which is option D.

But earlier, the dip from the spots is 0.051775, which is about half of the spot area. Because the spots are cooler, the dip is less than the area.

So if the dip is the same, then the planet's dip is 0.051775, which is about half the area of the spots.

So the planet's area would be 0.051775, so R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the intended approach is to equate the planet's area to the spot's area, leading to R_p ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the situation where the planet is causing a dip equal to the spot's area times the temperature difference.

But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the brightness variation caused by the spots as a "false planet" and find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

So, the dip from the spots is 0.051775, and the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Set them equal: (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp = 0.227 Rstar. Again, no matching option.

But perhaps the intended approach was to compute the planet's radius such that it blocks the same amount of flux as the spots emit.

But the spots are cooler, so they emit less, so to cause the same dip, the planet would have to block a certain area.

Wait, perhaps the total dip from the spots is the product of the area and the temperature difference.

The flux from the star is F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

The flux from the spots is F_spot = sigma T_spot^4 * A_spot.

The dip is F0 - F_spot = F0 [1 - (A_spot / (4 pi Rstar^2 )) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ].

So the dip is (A_spot / A_total) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is the same as before.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So to cause the same dip, the planet must block an area (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * pi Rstar^2 = pi Rp^2.

So the blocked flux is F_blocked = sigma T_eff^4 * (pi Rp^2).

The dip is F_blocked = sigma T_eff^4 * pi Rp^2.

The fractional dip is (F_blocked) / F0 = (pi Rp^2) / (4 pi Rstar^2) ) = (Rp^2) / (4 Rstar^2).

So setting this equal to 0.051775:

(Rp^2) / (4 Rstar^2) ) = 0.051775 → Rp^2 = 0.2071 * Rstar^2 → Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Which is about 0.455, which is close to option A) 0.39.

No, that's not it.

Wait, this approach is different. Let me think.

The dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because it's blocking a part of the star's flux.

The dip from the spots is 0.051775.

So to get the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But again, no option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look at the options and see which one, when squared, gives approximately 0.051775.

Looking at option C: 0.11.

(0.11)^2 = 0.0121 → no, that's too small.

Option B: 0.07. (0.07)^2 = 0.0049 → nope.

Option D: 0.32. (0.32)^2 = 0.1024 → that's larger than 0.051775.

Option A: 0.39. (0.39)^2 ≈ 0.1521 → nope.

Hmm. So none of the options when squared give 0.051775.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering how much the brightness changes due to the spots, but in reality, the star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The amplitude would then be the peak-to-peak variation, which is twice the dip I calculated.

Wait, no. The peak-to-peak variation would be F_max - F_min = 0.051775 F0.

If F_avg is (F_max + F_min)/2, then the amplitude is (F_max - F_avg) = 0.0258875 F0.

Wait, the amplitude in a light curve is often defined as the peak-to-peak variation, but sometimes it's the semi-amplitude (from average to peak).

In this case, the dip is 5.1775%, so the peak-to-peak is 5.1775% of F0.

The semi-amplitude would be half that, 2.58875%.

But the planet's dip is (R_p/Rstar)^2, which is 5.1775% (peak-to-peak), or 2.58875% (semi-amplitude).

Wait, but I'm not sure how the problem defines the amplitude. If the amplitude is the semi-amplitude, then perhaps I should set (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.0258875 → R_p ≈ 0.1608 Rstar.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the maximum brightness change, which is 5.1775% of the total flux. So the planet needs to cause the same 5.1775% dip.

Thus, (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But no matching option.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. The correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 0.227 Rstar, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation.

Going back, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, but they are on a hemisphere, so the calculation should use the average temperature of the star.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's flux when the spots are present is F = (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

I think I must have made a mistake earlier. Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 0.11, which when squared is 0.0121, but that's much less than 0.051775.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the planet's radius is being compared to the star's radius. So perhaps the correct value is the square root of 0.051775, which is approximately 0.227. But no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 0.11, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the planet's radius is being compared to the star's radius, so for example, a planet with radius 0.11 Rstar would have an area of (0.11)^2 = 0.0121, which is about 1.2% of the star's area. That's not matching the 5.17% dip.

I'm really stuck here. I think the correct approach leads to 0.227 Rstar, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121) ≈ 0.11, but I don't see how that connects.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the dip in terms of the star's luminosity.

The dip is 0.051775 of the star's flux.

The planet's dip is (R_p/Rstar)^2.

So setting them equal, R_p = 0.227 Rstar.

Ah, but perhaps I was supposed to use the radius as a fraction of the host star, but the options are in Jupiter radii or Earth radii. Wait, but the options are unitless, so it's R_p/Rstar.

So I'm confident that my calculation leads to R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.227, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option C) 0.11.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done in terms of the planet's area compared to the spotted area.

The spotted area is 0.1 of the star.

The planet's area is (R_p/Rstar)^2.

To have the same dip, (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → R_p = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is option D.

Ah! That's a possibility. Because the dip from the planet is (R_p/Rstar)^2, and the dip from the spots is 0.051775, but perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area (0.1) as the dip, not considering the temperature.

In that case, (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → R_p ≈ 0.316, option D.

But earlier, I thought that the dip from the spots is 5.1775%, not 10%.

Ah, perhaps the question is comparing the planet's area to the spot's area, not considering the temperature difference. So if the planet's area is 0.1 of the star, then the dip is 10%, which is larger than what the spots cause.

But the problem states that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet, so the amplitude in the light curve is the same.

But perhaps the intended approach is to equate the planet's area to the spot's area, leading to option D.

But in that case, the dip would be 10%, which is larger than the spot's dip of 5.1775%.

So perhaps the intended approach is to equate the planet's dip to the spot's dip, leading to R_p ≈ 0.227, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the planet's signal in terms of the star's brightness variation.

The star's brightness variation is 5.1775%, which is the same as the planet's dip. So the planet's dip is 5.1775%, so (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is about 0.11, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dip. Let me try another approach.

The dip from the spots is (f) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775%.

The planet's dip is (R_p/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is the Sun, and the planet's radius is expressed in Jupiter radii. Because Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun.

So 0.227 R_sun is about 2.27 Jupiter radii, which is larger than Jupiter. But the options are unitless, so perhaps not.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, and perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, but I can't see how that connects. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 0.32, based on the spot's area being 0.1.

Wait, if the planet's area is 0.1, then R_p/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~0.32.

But earlier, that would cause a dip of 10%, which is larger than the spot's dip of 5.17%. So I'm confused.

But given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to consider the planet's area equal to the spot's area, leading to option D.

So I'll go with option C) 0.11, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me compute it accurately.

(5/6)^4:

5/6 = 0.8333333.

(0.8333333)^2 = 0.6944444.

(0.6944444)^2 = ?

Compute 0.69 * 0.69 = 0.4761.

Compute 0.0044444 * 0.69 = 0.0030555.

0.69 * 0.0044444 ≈ 0.0030555.

0.0044444^2 ≈ 0.00001975.

So adding:

0.4761 + 0.0030555 + 0.0030555 + 0.00001975 ≈ 0.48223.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775%.

Thus, the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But again, no option matches.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the planet's radius based on the star's flux change.

The dip from the spots is 5.1775%.

The dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have this.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the planet's radius in Jupiter radii, but the question says relative to the host star's radius.

In any case, I think the correct calculation leads to R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.227, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

In the absence of the correct option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the effect of the spot's size on the star's brightness over rotation. The star's brightness varies as the spots rotate, leading to a sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of 5.1775%.

The planet would cause a similar amplitude when transiting. The planet's transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the same amplitude would require (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

No matching option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended approach was to calculate R_p as sqrt(0.1) → 0.316, option D.

So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the spotted hemisphere, we analyze the brightness variations caused by the spots and compare them to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation from Spots**:
   - The fractional dip in brightness when the spots are visible is determined by the area of the spots and the temperature difference:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right),
     \]
     where \( f = 0.1 \) (since the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the total star surface area).

   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.1 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
     Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \). Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775.
     \]
     The fractional dip caused by the spots is approximately \( 5.1775\% \).

3. **Brightness Variation from a Planet**:
   - When a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius relative to the star's radius:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To produce the same amplitude signal as the spots, we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.227.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options:
     - **A) ~0.39**: Too large.
     - **B) ~0.07**: Too small.
     - **C) ~0.11**: Too small.
     - **D) ~0.32**: Closest, but still larger than the calculated value.

5. **Revisiting the Interpretation**:
   - If the problem assumes the planet's area must match the spotted area (10% of the star's surface), then:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1 \implies \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1} \approx 0.316.
     \]
     This corresponds closely to option **D) ~0.32**.

### Conclusion:
While the direct calculation yields \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.227 \), none of the options match this value. The closest interpretation aligns with option **D**, assuming the planet's area must match the spotted area rather than the brightness dip.
