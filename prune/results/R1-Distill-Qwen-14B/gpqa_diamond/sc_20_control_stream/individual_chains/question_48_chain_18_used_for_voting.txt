Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine. Oh wait, bromine adds to ketones in a specific way. I think it's the haloform reaction, but wait, that's usually when you have multiple methyl ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine to a ketone, it could be a bromohydrin formation, but that usually requires water as well. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha bromination? Wait, no, I think when you treat a ketone with bromine, it's more about the enol formation. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Oh, wait, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like dichloromethane leads to the formation of a dibromide. Because the carbonyl group is electron-deficient, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. So bromine would add across the alpha positions, leading to a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane or maybe a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienone or something else, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. Oh, wait, no, cyclohexanone has a planar carbonyl, so Br2 would add across the double bond. So cyclohexanone has a (CH2)5 ring with a ketone. Adding Br2 would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with one ketone. Adding Br2 would probably add across the carbonyl group, but wait, ketones don't have a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent one. Oh wait, cyclohexanone's structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a carbonyl (C=O). So the carbonyl is part of the ring, making it a cyclic ketone. When you add Br2, perhaps it undergoes an addition across the carbonyl group, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so adding Br2 would lead to a vicinal dibromide. So the cyclohexanone would have the C=O, and adding Br2 would convert the carbonyl group into a C-Br2 group. Wait, no, that can't be right because the carbonyl is a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation or something else. Or maybe addition to the double bond, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond except the carbonyl. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't adding across the carbonyl. Another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo enolate formation when treated with a base, but bromine is a dienophile. Wait, perhaps it's a dienone adding bromine? No, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is adding to the alpha position via some kind of keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, I think I remember that when a ketone is treated with bromine, it undergoes a bromohydrin formation in the presence of water. But in this case, the question says that product 1 is formed by treating cyclohexanone with bromine. So perhaps the reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to a bromocyclohexanol or something else. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack. Wait, no, bromine is more of an electrophilic reagent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. If cyclohexanone has the carbonyl, adding Br2 across it would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So that would be product 1 as 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide. That sounds like an elimination reaction. Because when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane) are treated with a base, they undergo elimination to form an alkene. So product 2 would be cyclohexene. Wait, but wait, cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond. However, elimination would form cyclohexene, but the position of the double bond depends on the structure. Wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, so elimination would form cyclohexene with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, right?

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If we remove two adjacent bromines, the ring would form a double bond in that position, making cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Next, product 2 (cyclohexene) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine. Thionyl chloride typically converts alcohols to chlorides, but in this case, cyclohexene doesn't have an alcohol group. Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe product 2 isn't cyclohexene. Let me re-examine.

Wait, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, and when heated with NaOH, it would eliminate to form cyclohexene. But wait, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, the elimination would produce cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But let's think about the structure of cyclohexene. It's a six-membered ring with a double bond, so it's either cis or trans, but in the case of elimination, the geometry depends on the stereochemistry of the dihalide. But since the starting dihalide is from cyclohexanone, which is a planar structure, perhaps the dihalide is trans, leading to a trans double bond upon elimination. Wait, but cyclohexene is a ring, and the double bond is between two adjacent carbons.

Wait, but wait, maybe the elimination leads to a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, which upon elimination forms cyclohexene.

So product 2 is cyclohexene. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride usually reacts with alcohols, but cyclohexene doesn't have an -OH group. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me think again. When cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, maybe it's an alpha bromination. Oh! Oh wait, that's possible. The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, making the alpha hydrogens acidic. So when we add bromine, perhaps it's undergoing an electrophilic substitution, where the alpha hydrogen is replaced by Br. But wait, cyclohexanone has two alpha positions, each with two hydrogens (since it's a six-membered ring). So adding Br2 would lead to a mono-brominated product because if it's mono, but wait, bromine is in excess, so maybe more than one substitution.

Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is bromination via enol formation. The enol form would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making the alpha position more susceptible to electrophilic attack. So, when Br2 is added, it would add across the double bond of the enol, leading to a di-substituted product. But wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation, but without water, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromocyclohexanol. Wait, no, that's if there's an addition of HBr, but no, in this case, Br2 without water is used.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, which would form a geminal di-bromide. So cyclohexanone would become 2-bromo-cyclohexanone? No, because adding Br to the carbonyl carbon would lead to two Brs on the same carbon. So product 1 would be 2,2-dibromocyclohexane?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction of ketones with bromine. Oh right, I think that when a ketone is treated with excess bromine, it can undergo the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with ketones and forms a ketone oxide. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, the reaction could be the formation of a bromohydrin when bromine and water are present, but without water, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexanone could undergo a ring-opening reaction. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's try to proceed with what I thought earlier, assuming product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Moving on: product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. When treated with NaOH and heated, it undergoes elimination to form cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride usually converts alcohols to chlorides, but cyclohexene doesn't have an OH group. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, maybe the cyclohexene is ring-opening under these conditions. But I don't recall thionyl chloride reacting with alkenes directly. Alternatively, perhaps the process is different.

Wait, maybe product 2 isn't cyclohexene, but something else. Let me reconsider product 1 and product 2.

Alternative approach: perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a bromide. So cyclohexanone (O=C-R) reacts with Br2 to form OBr-C-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a bromide via a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, the reaction could be the formation of a dibromide at the alpha position. So the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) would get brominated. Since cyclohexanone has two alpha positions (each with two H's), adding Br2 would lead to bromination at both alpha positions, but maybe only one of them is possible. Or perhaps it's a cyclic bromonium ion formation, leading to a 1,2-dibromide.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and see if that helps. So product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with thionyl chloride and pyridine. If product 2 is cyclohexene, then what does thionyl chloride do? It doesn't react with alkenes. So perhaps product 2 is an alcohol or something else. Wait, if product 1 is a vicinal dihalide, product 2 upon elimination would be cyclohexene, which doesn't react with thionyl chloride. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps the first step isn't an elimination. Let me think again. Maybe product 1 is a bromide at the alpha position. So cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1, which is a mono-brominated cyclohexanone. That would make the next step more feasible.

Wait, but if product 1 is a mono-bromide, then when heated with NaOH, it would undergo elimination. Wait, but mono-halides aren't as likely to eliminate. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a vicinal dihalide, but that's leading to cyclohexene, which doesn't react with thionyl chloride.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe the first reaction is the formation of a cyclohexyl bromide via substitution, but that seems unlikely without a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group, making a bromide. So, cyclohexanone would have the carbonyl converted into a bromide, but I don't know how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substitution, but that's unclear.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the final step. Product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3, which is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reductions where other hydrides might not work. It's a bulky hydride, so it might prefer less hindered positions. So if product 3 is an acid chloride, for example, then product 4 would be an alcohol. Or if product 3 is an alkyl chloride, then product 4 would be an alkane after reduction.

Wait, but LiAlH is a reducing agent. It reduces esters, ketones, nitriles, etc. So let's think about what product 3 could be.

Product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride is commonly used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, or alcohols to chlorides. So perhaps product 2 has an -OH group, which is converted to Cl in product 3.

So product 2 must be an alcohol. Now, if product 2 is an alcohol, that means product 1 must have been a halide, likely a bromide, which upon treatment with a base (like NaOH) would undergo elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't produce an alcohol. Wait, elimination would form an alkene, but perhaps another possibility is that product 1 is a dihalide that, upon hydrolysis, forms an alcohol. Wait, but no, product 1 is treated with NaOH, which is aqueous conditions, but the question doesn't mention water. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a bromide at the alpha position. So, after the first step, we have a mono-bromide at the alpha position. Then, when heated with NaOH, maybe it undergoes elimination to form an alkene. But that would form cyclohexene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction that forms an alcohol, but that doesn't make much sense with NaOH and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted product, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to retrace.

Starting with cyclohexanone. Reaction with Br2: possible options are adding Br across the carbonyl (forming a di bromide) or brominating the alpha carbon. Let's say it's the latter. So product 1 would be alpha-bromocyclohexanone. Then, when product 1 is treated with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination, removing the Br and the adjacent H to form an alkene. Wait, but that would require a base to abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. But cyclohexene doesn't have an -OH group, so this doesn't make sense. Hmm. So perhaps product 2 isn't cyclohexene. Maybe my initial assumption about the first step is wrong.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the first reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, forming a di bromide. So product 1 is a vicinal dibromide. Then, product 1 is treated with NaOH, which causes elimination, forming an alkene. So product 2 is cyclohexene. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride. But as before, this doesn't fit because thionyl chloride doesn't react with alkenes. So perhaps product 3 is something else.

Wait, maybe product 2 is cyclohexanol. How? Because if product 1 is an epoxide or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide that upon treatment with NaOH forms an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a geminal di bromide, meaning both Brs are on the same carbon. Then, when treated with NaOH, it could undergo hydrolysis to form a ketone or perhaps an alcohol. Wait, gem-dibromides typically hydrolyze to form ketones. So if product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone, then product 2 would be cyclohexanone again. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide on the alpha carbon. So when NaOH is added, it could substitute the Br with an OH group, forming cyclohexanol. Then, product 2 would be cyclohexanol.

Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, which would convert the alcohol to an acid chloride. So product 3 would be cyclohexanoyl chloride.

Then, product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a strong reducing agent, but it's typically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Wait, but LiAlH4 is usually for ketones and esters. Wait, but when you have an acid chloride, you can reduce it to a primary alcohol. Because the mechanism would involve the hydride attacking the carbonyl, leading to the formation of an aldehyde, but wait, no, with a strong enough reducing agent, it would go all the way to the primary alcohol.

Wait, no, acid chlorides can be reduced to primary alcohols using LiAlH(t-BuO)3. Because acid chlorides are more reactive than ketones, so they would be reduced to aldehydes, but wait, no, wait. Wait, in the presence of a strong reducing agent like LiAlH(t-BuO)3, an acid chloride (RCOCl) would be reduced to RCH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when an acid chloride is treated with LiAlH4, it's reduced to a primary alcohol. Because the hydride attacks the carbonyl, the chloride leaves, and then it gets protonated, but I might be getting the steps wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the acid chloride is first converted to an aldehyde via the reduction, but maybe under certain conditions, it goes all the way to the alcohol.

Wait, LiAlH4 typically reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So if product 3 is cyclohexanoyl chloride, product 4 would be cyclohexanol.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So if product 4 is cyclohexanol, what's the structure? Cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with an -OH group attached to one carbon. So the molecule has a certain symmetry.

Wait, cyclohexanol has a chair conformation. The hydroxyl group is on one carbon. So the adjacent carbons (the ones next to the OH) have two different environments: one axial and one equatorial. Wait, but when considering the chair structure, the axial and equatorial positions can lead to different types of protons.

Wait, but in cyclohexanol, the hydroxyl is on a carbon, say, axial. Then, the adjacent carbons would have different protons. But let me think about the symmetry. If the OH is on a carbon, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through that carbon and the opposite one, perhaps. Wait, no, because the OH is in a specific position, so the molecule isn't symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogens on the cyclohexanol are as follows: the OH-bearing carbon has two equivalent Hs? No, wait, no, because in cyclohexanol, the OH is attached to a carbon in a six-membered ring. So that carbon is CH2-OH? No, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one CH2 group is replaced by an OH. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group attached to one of the CH2 groups. So each carbon in the ring is CH2, except the one with the OH, which is CH(OH).

Wait, no, wait, cyclohexanol structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(OH) group. So the molecule is:

       O
       |
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2
       |
       CH2
       |
       CH2
       |
       CH2

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of chair conformation. The OH group is axial or equatorial. But regardless, when looking for chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to consider symmetry.

So, in cyclohexanol, the hydrogens can be categorized based on their positions relative to the OH group. For example:

1. The two hydrogens on the same carbon as the OH (but wait, that carbon has only one OH and two CH2 groups? Or is it a CH with two Hs and an OH?)

Wait, no: the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is attached to an OH group, making it a secondary alcohol. So the structure is:

Each carbon in the ring is CH2, except one which is CH(OH) attached to two other CH2 groups.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: cyclohexanol's structure is a six-membered ring where each carbon is CH2 except for one, which is CH2OH? No, that's not right. Wait, no, cyclohexanol is (CH2)5CH(OH). No, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanol is a cyclic hexanol, so the structure is a six-membered ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(OH) group. So each of the six carbons in the ring has two CH2 groups except for the one with the OH, which has two CH2 groups attached. Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure mentally. Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring where each carbon is CH2, except one which is CH(OH). So that carbon has two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons, so the structure is a chair with an OH group on one of the carbons.

In any case, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So if product 4 is cyclohexanol, how many distinct Hs are there?

In cyclohexanol, the hydrogens can be categorized based on their positions relative to the OH group. The hydrogens on the same carbon as the OH (if any) would be equivalent? Wait, in cyclohexanol, the OH is on a CH2 group, right? No, no, cyclohexanol has each carbon as CH2 except one, which is CH2OH? No, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure of cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH2OH group. No, that's not right. Wait, cyclohexanol is (CH2)5CH2OH, but arranged in a ring. Wait no, that's not possible because that would make a seven-membered ring. Oh, wait, no, cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(OH) group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 connected in a ring.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think: cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with one OH group attached to a carbon. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group on one of the carbons, making it a secondary alcohol. So each carbon in the ring is CH2 except for the one with the OH, which is CH2-OH? No, wait, in cyclohexanol, the OH is on a carbon that's bonded to two CH2 groups. So the structure is (CH2)5CH(OH). No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. In cyclohexanol, the OH is on one carbon. The adjacent carbons (each bonded to the OH-bearing carbon) have two different types of hydrogens. Let's imagine the chair conformation. The OH group can be axial or equatorial. But regardless, the adjacent carbons would have axial and equatorial hydrogens.

But considering all the symmetry, how many distinct Hs are there?

Alternative approach: in cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the OH-bearing carbon and the opposite carbon. So the hydrogens can be arranged into different symmetry-equivalent positions.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the molecule. The carbon with the OH is C1. C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1, C3 and C5 are next, and C4 is opposite.

In terms of hydrogen environments:

- The OH-bearing carbon (C1) has two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent? They would be if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Since the molecule is symmetric with respect to the C1-C4 axis, the two Hs on C1 are in equivalent environments. So they're one type.

- C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1. Each has two Hs, but are they all equivalent? Let's see: C2 and C6 are symmetric due to the plane of symmetry. So the Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent. So each of these carbons has two Hs, but they are in the same environment. Wait, no, because C2 and C6 are each attached to C1, but their positions relative to the ring may differ. Wait, no, in the chair conformation, C2 and C6 would be on the same side as the OH group if it's axial, leading to their Hs being similar, but perhaps they are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the number of unique H environments:

1. The two Hs on C1 (same as each other).
2. The four Hs on C2 and C6 (since each has two Hs, but C2 and C6 are equivalent, so their Hs are the same).
3. The four Hs on C3 and C5 (equivalent positions, each with two Hs).
4. The two Hs on C4 (opposite the OH, same as each other).

Wait, but that would make 4 distinct types of Hs. But that can't be right because the question options don't have 4 as an option. Alternatively, I'm miscounting.

Wait, let me think again.

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4. So the Hs can be categorized as follows:

- Hs on C1: two Hs, equivalent. → 1 type.
- Hs on C2 and C6: each has two Hs, but are they equivalent? Since C2 and C6 are mirror images across the plane, their Hs are in equivalent environments. So all four Hs (two on C2 and two on C6) are equivalent. → 1 type.
- Hs on C3 and C5: each has two Hs, and they're mirror images as well. So their Hs are equivalent. → 1 type.
- Hs on C4: two Hs, equivalent. → 1 type.

Wait, that gives 4 types, but the options don't include 4.

Alternatively, maybe there are more types because some of the Hs are in different environments. Let's think about the chair conformation. If the OH is axial, the axial Hs on C2 would be up, and the equatorial Hs would be down. Wait, but in reality, the chair conformation leads to axial and equatorial Hs. So maybe the Hs on C2 are a mix of axial and equatorial, leading to different environments.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the number of unique H environments in cyclohexanol.

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a certain symmetry, but let's count:

- The OH-bearing carbon (C1) has two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent? Yes, due to the plane of symmetry. → 1 type.
- The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent between C2 and C6? Yes, because of the molecule's symmetry. So each of these Hs is equivalent, but are the axial and equatorial Hs on C2 equivalent? No, because in the chair conformation, axial and equatorial Hs are in different environments. So perhaps each C2 and C6 has two types of Hs: axial and equatorial. But wait, if the OH is axial, then the axial H on C2 would be close to the OH, perhaps leading to different chemical shifts.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the actual number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol. I think the correct number is 6. Because in the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial Hs are different. Let me see:

- C1: 2 Hs (equivalent) → 1 type.
- C2: 2 axial Hs and 2 equatorial Hs (but wait, each C has only two Hs. Wait, no, each C has two Hs, but in the chair conformation, their orientation can make them equivalent or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 8. I think I've read that in cyclohexanol, there are 8 unique Hs when considering the chair conformation.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product 4 is not cyclohexanol. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's go back. Let me summarize the steps again.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.
2. Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → product 2.
3. Product 2 + SOCl2 + pyridine → product 3.
4. Product 3 + LiAlH(t-BuO)3 → product 4.

If product 4 is a secondary alcohol, perhaps the number of Hs is 8.

Wait, but let's see another approach. Let's think about each step again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2. Let's assume it's a bromination at the alpha position. So product 1 is alpha-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: Product 1 (alpha-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated). This could be an elimination reaction, forming cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: Product 2 (cyclohexene) + SOCl2 + pyridine. Hmm, but cyclohexene doesn't have an -OH group, so this doesn't make sense. So perhaps product 2 isn't cyclohexene.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a vicinal di-bromide. Then product 2 is cyclohexene. But then product 3 would have to be something else.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a bromide at the alpha position, and product 2 is a ketone after elimination, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, making a di bromide. So product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 treated with NaOH. Heating 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone with NaOH would lead to elimination, but with two Brs on the same carbon, perhaps it forms a ketone again. Wait, no, elimination would require adjacent Brs. So maybe product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, step 2 is elimination to form cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: cyclohexene + SOCl2. But without an -OH group, it doesn't react. So perhaps this path is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a bromide in a different position. Let's say cyclohexanone (after bromination) becomes 3-bromocyclohexanone. Then, step 2 would be elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let's think about the final step. Product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3 to form product 4. LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce acid chlorides. So product 3 is likely an acid chloride. Then, product 4 would be the corresponding alcohol.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, then product 2 must be a carboxylic acid. Because thionyl chloride converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides.

So, product 2 is a carboxylic acid. Then, product 1 must have been a halide that upon treatment with NaOH forms a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how does a dihalide become a carboxylic acid upon treatment with NaOH? That would require hydrolysis. For example, a vicinal dihalide can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 1 is a bromide on the alpha carbon. So, when product 1 is treated with aqueous NaOH, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Let me consider:

Product 1: alpha-bromocyclohexanone → upon treatment with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis to form cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Then, product 2 is cyclohexanecarboxylic acid.

Then, product 2 is treated with SOCl2 and pyridine, which converts the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride (product 3: cyclohexanoyl chloride).

Finally, product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3, which reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. Wait, but wait, LiAlH4 typically reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So product 4 would be cyclohexylmethanol or something else? Wait, no, reducing an acid chloride (RCOCl) would give RCH2OH. But cyclohexanoyl chloride is (cyclohexyl)COCl. Reducing that would give (cyclohexyl)CH2OH, which is cyclohexylmethanol.

Wait, cyclohexylmethanol has a structure where a cyclohexyl group is attached to a CH2OH. So the structure is CH2OH connected to a cyclohexane ring.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, which is cyclohexylmethanol.

So, let's analyze the structure:

The molecule is CH2OH attached to a cyclohexane ring. The cyclohexane ring would have substituents, which affects the symmetry and the number of distinct Hs.

Looking at the cyclohexylmethanol molecule:

- The CH2OH group has two Hs on the CH2, which are equivalent (axial and equatorial positions, but in this case, since it's a CH2, they're equivalent).
- The cyclohexane ring is substituted with a CH2OH group. The ring has a substituent, which breaks some symmetry.

So, the cyclohexane ring now has a substituent (CH2OH) attached to one carbon. This makes the molecule asymmetric around that carbon.

In such a molecule, the Hs on the ring can be categorized as follows:

1. The two Hs on the same carbon as the CH2OH substituent (if any). Wait, no, the substituent is on one carbon, which is connected to two Hs. So that carbon's Hs are equivalent. → 1 type.
2. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two Hs. Because of the substituent, the axial and equatorial Hs may not be equivalent. So each adjacent carbon has two types of Hs. But wait, because the substituent is on C1, the Cs adjacent to it (C2 and C6) have different environments. Are their Hs equivalent? No, because the substituent breaks the symmetry. So each of these adjacent carbons has two distinct Hs, but are they all different from each other? Let's see:
   - C2 has two Hs, which can be axial and equatorial. These are in different environments, so they're distinct.
   - Similarly, C6 has two Hs, which are also in different environments.
   But are the axial H on C2 and the axial H on C6 equivalent? No, because the substituent is on C1, making them in different environments. Similarly, the equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are also in different environments.
   So each of these has two distinct Hs, making a total of 4 types from C2 and C6.
3. The next carbons (C3 and C5) are further away. Each has two Hs, but due to the substituent, their environments are different. So each C3 and C5's Hs are in different environments. So each has two distinct Hs, but perhaps C3 and C5 are mirror images, so their Hs are equivalent.
   Wait, but in reality, the substituent on C1 would make C3 and C5 have different environments. So each has two Hs, but their axial and equatorial positions might lead to different environments.
   Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's presence causes all the Hs on C3 and C5 to be unique. So each C3 and C5 has two distinct Hs, making 4 types.
4. The carbon opposite to the substituent (C4) has two Hs, which are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. → 1 type.

Wait, but let me count again:

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs (equivalent) → 1 type.
- C1 (same as CH2OH): 2 Hs → 1 type.
Wait, no, the substituent is on C1. C1 is connected to CH2OH and two other carbons. So C1's Hs are on the same carbon as the substituent. So the Hs on C1 are equivalent → 1 type.

Then, C2 and C6: each has two Hs, which are not equivalent to each other or to Hs on other carbons. So each C2 and C6 contribute two distinct types. So that's 4 types.

C3 and C5: each has two Hs, but are they equivalent? Perhaps not, because the substituent affects their environments. So each contributes two types, but perhaps C3's Hs are equivalent to C5's Hs. So 2 types.

C4: two Hs, equivalent → 1 type.

So total types:

CH2OH: 1
C1: 1
C2: 2
C6: 2
C3: 2
C5: 2
C4:1

Wait, but that adds up to 1+1+2+2+2+2+1 = 11, which is way more than the options given. So I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2OH)Cyclohexane, where the CH2OH is attached to one carbon of the ring, making it a secondary alcohol. So the structure is cyclohexanol, which I discussed earlier.

But earlier, I was confused about the number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol. Let me try to count again.

In cyclohexanol:

- The OH is on C1. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4.
- C1: two Hs (equivalent) → 1 type.
- C2 and C6: each has two Hs. Are these equivalent? For each, the axial and equatorial Hs are in different environments, so each has two types. So C2 contributes 2, C6 contributes 2. But due to the plane of symmetry, the axial H on C2 is equivalent to the axial H on C6, and the equatorial H on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial H on C6. So each of these pairs are equivalent. So C2 and C6 together contribute 2 types (axial and equatorial).
- C3 and C5: each has two Hs. Again, the plane of symmetry makes axial H on C3 equivalent to axial on C5, and equatorial on C3 equivalent to equatorial on C5. So C3 and C5 contribute 2 types.
- C4: two Hs, equivalent → 1 type.

So in total, the types are:

1. C1: 1
2. Axial on C2 and C6: 1
3. Equatorial on C2 and C6: 1
4. Axial on C3 and C5: 1
5. Equatorial on C3 and C5: 1
6. C4: 1

That's a total of 6 types. But the options don't have 6 as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7. Oh, option A is 6.

But wait, this is assuming that the axial and equatorial Hs on the same carbon are different. So each axial and equatorial is a separate type.

But in cyclohexanol, the axial and equatorial Hs on the same carbon are different because of their positions. So each carbon has two types of Hs, except C1 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the count is:

- C1: 2 Hs (1 type)
- C2: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)
- C3: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)
- C4: 2 Hs (1 type)
- C5: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)
- C6: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)

Wait, but this can't be right because that would sum to 1+2+2+1+2+2=10, which is option C. But earlier I thought the count was 6.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of an alternative approach. The correct answer is likely 8, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 4 is not cyclohexanol. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → alpha-bromocyclohexanone.
2. alpha-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexenone (a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group).
3. cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → forms an acid chloride (I'm not sure about this step).
4. acid chloride + LiAlH → primary alcohol.

But this seems unlikely because I'm not sure about step 3.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a different structure altogether, leading to a different count of Hs.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct structure of product 4.

Let me try to outline the reactions step by step again, more carefully.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

   Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding Br2 can lead to bromination at the alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl). So product 1 would be 2-bromo-cyclohexanone.

2. Product 1 (2-bromo-cyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → product 2.

   Reaction with NaOH could lead to elimination, forming an alkene. The bromide is on C2, so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexenone (cyclohexene ring with a ketone). So product 2 is cyclohexenone.

3. Product 2 (cyclohexenone) + SOCl2 + pyridine → product 3.

   Thionyl chloride typically converts ketones to chlorides. Wait, but cyclohexenone is a cyclic ketone. Treating it with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to an acid chloride. So product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride.

4. Product 3 (cyclohexenoyl chloride) + LiAlH(t-BuO)3 → product 4.

   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a strong reducing agent that can reduce acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So the acid chloride (RCOCl) would be reduced to RCH2OH. So product 4 would be cyclohexenylmethanol.

Wait, but cyclohexenoyl chloride is (cyclohexenyl)COCl. Reducing this would give (cyclohexenyl)CH2OH, which is cyclohexenylmethanol.

Now, the structure of cyclohexenylmethanol is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a CH2OH group attached to one of the carbons adjacent to the double bond.

The structure would be:

CH2OH attached to C2 of cyclohexene.

So the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and a CH2OH group attached to C2.

Wait, no, because cyclohexenone is a ring with a double bond and a ketone. When reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with a double bond (say, between C1 and C2) and a CH2OH group attached to C2.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH-(CH2)3-CH2-OH?

Wait, no, in a ring. It would be cyclohexene with a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as a cyclohexene ring where one of the double-bonded carbons (say, C1) has a CH2OH substituent attached to C2.

But regardless, the important point is that the molecule has a double bond and a CH2OH group. This would affect the symmetry and the number of distinct Hs.

So, product 4 is cyclohexenylmethanol.

Now, let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

The structure would be:

Positions:

C1: double bond to C2.

C2: attached to CH2OH and double bond to C1.

C3, C4, C5, C6: other carbons in the ring.

So, the molecule has a substituent (CH2OH) on C2, and a double bond between C1 and C2.

This would create several distinct environments for the hydrogens.

Let's consider each carbon:

1. C1: part of the double bond, so each H on C1 (if any) would be distinct. But wait, in the ring, C1 is double-bonded to C2, so it doesn't have any Hs. So no Hs on C1.

2. C2: attached to CH2OH and double bond. So, C2 has two substituents: the double bond and the CH2OH. The Hs on C2 (if any) would be in a unique environment. Wait, no, C2 is double-bonded to C1, so it doesn't have any Hs.

Wait, no, if the ring is cyclohexene, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 and C2 are each double-bonded, meaning no Hs on those carbons.

Wait, no, that's not right. In cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond has one substituent. So C1 is bonded to C2 and two other carbons (C6 and C2), making it a double bond. So C1 has two substituents (C6 and C2), but no Hs because it's part of a double bond.

Wait, no, in cyclohexene, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. So each of these carbons is bonded to two other carbons and a double bond. So each has one H. Wait, no, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons and one double bond, so each has two Hs. Wait, no, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

The structure of cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. Each carbon in the double bond (C1 and C2) is bonded to two other carbons (C6 and C3 for C1; C1 and C3 for C2) and has two Hs each. So, each of these carbons has two Hs.

But in cyclohexenylmethanol, the CH2OH group is attached to C2. So C2 has:

- A double bond to C1.
- A single bond to C3.
- A single bond to CH2OH.

So, C2 has two Hs.

Wait, no, if C2 is double-bonded to C1, it can't have two Hs. Because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons, so no Hs. Wait, no, that's not right. For cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond has two Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the structure. In cyclohexene, each of the double-bonded carbons (C1 and C2) is bonded to two other carbons and has two Hs each.

So, C1 has two Hs, and C2 has two Hs. Now, in cyclohexenylmethanol, the CH2OH is attached to C2. So, C2 now has:

- A double bond to C1.
- A single bond to C3.
- A single bond to CH2OH.

So, how many Hs does C2 have? In the double bond, each carbon has two substituents (the other two bonds are to other carbons). So, C2, being part of a double bond, has no Hs. So, the CH2OH must be attached to another carbon, perhaps C3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is cyclohexenone, which is cyclohexene with a ketone group. When the ketone is reduced, it becomes a CH2OH group. So, the ketone is on C2, which is part of the double bond between C1 and C2. So, in cyclohexenone, C2 is part of the double bond and has a ketone group. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group.

So the structure becomes:

C1 is double-bonded to C2. C2 has the CH2OH group attached. So, C2 has a double bond to C1, and a single bond to C3 and to CH2OH.

So, C2 has no Hs because it's part of a double bond. The CH2OH is attached to C2, which is already double-bonded. So, the Hs on the CH2OH are two, but what about the rest of the ring?

Wait, perhaps the CH2OH is on C3. Let me clarify.

In cyclohexenone, the ketone is on C2, which is part of the double bond between C1 and C2. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group on C2.

So, the structure is:

C1=C2-OH (but wait, no, the ketone is on C2, so after reduction, it's CH2OH attached to C2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring. Let's say the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a ketone group. So, in cyclohexenone, C2 is part of the double bond and has a carbonyl group. Then, after reduction with LiAlH, the ketone becomes CH2OH, making C2 have a CH2OH group and being part of the double bond.

But that would mean C2 has a CH2OH group and a double bond to C1. So, C2 has no Hs because it's part of a double bond. Then, the CH2OH is attached to C2, which is part of the double bond.

But then, what about the Hs on CH2OH? They are two Hs, both equivalent.

The cyclohexene ring now has the CH2OH group on C2, which is part of the double bond. So, the ring looks like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but arranged in a ring, so the last CH2 connects back to C1).

Wait, no, that's not a ring. Let me think again.

The correct structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a CH2OH group attached to C2.

So, the ring is:

C1=C2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but arranged in a ring, so C6 connects back to C1).

In this structure:

- C1: double-bonded to C2, has two Hs (since it's part of the double bond).
- C2: double-bonded to C1, and attached to CH2OH. So, C2 has no Hs because it's double-bonded and has two single bonds (to C1 and C3, and the CH2OH is attached to C2? Or is the CH2OH attached to C3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The ketone is on C2, which is part of the double bond. So, after reduction, the ketone becomes CH2OH on C2. So, C2 is double-bonded to C1 and attached to CH2OH.

So, C2 has no Hs, but the CH2OH is attached to C2, which is part of the double bond. Therefore, the CH2OH group has two Hs, which are equivalent.

Now, the rest of the ring: C3, C4, C5, C6.

Each of these has two Hs, but their environments are affected by the substituents.

So, considering the molecule's symmetry, let's count the distinct Hs.

1. The two Hs on CH2OH group: equivalent → 1 type.
2. The two Hs on C1 (from the double bond): each is in a unique environment because of the substituent. Wait, but C1 is part of the double bond and has two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent? Because C1 is part of the double bond and attached to C6 and C2, which are both CH2 groups. So, the Hs on C1 are in the same environment → 1 type.
3. The ring carbons C3, C4, C5, and C6: each has two Hs. Let's analyze their environments.

C3 is attached to C2 (double bond and CH2OH) and C4. So, the Hs on C3 are in a unique environment. Are the Hs on C3 equivalent? Let's imagine the chair conformation. The substituent (CH2OH) on C2 would cause the axial and equatorial Hs on C3 to be in different environments. So, each C3 has two distinct Hs → 2 types.

Similarly, C4 is attached to C3 and C5. Its Hs are influenced by the substituent. So, the Hs on C4 are in a different environment than those on C3.

Wait, but without the substituent, the ring would have symmetry, but with the substituent, the symmetry is broken.

So, each of C3, C4, C5, and C6 would have their own unique H environments.

Wait, but perhaps not. Let me think about the substituent's effect.

The substituent is on C2, which is part of the double bond. So, the ring's substituent is on C2, making the structure asymmetric. This would cause each of the other carbons (C3, C4, C5, C6) to have unique environments for their Hs.

But perhaps some of them are equivalent due to the ring's arrangement.

For example:

- C3 and C6 are symmetric with respect to the substituent on C2. So, the Hs on C3 and C6 are in similar environments, making them equivalent.
- Similarly, C4 and C5 are symmetric, so their Hs are equivalent.

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me visualize:

If the substituent is on C2, then C3 and C6 are in similar positions relative to the substituent, so their Hs would be equivalent. Similarly, C4 and C5 are in symmetric positions. So:

- C3 and C6: each has two Hs, which are equivalent across the molecule → 2 types (axial and equatorial, if applicable).
- C4 and C5: each has two Hs, which are equivalent across the molecule → 2 types.

So, putting it all together:

1. CH2OH group: 2 Hs → 1 type.
2. C1: 2 Hs → 1 type.
3. C3 and C6: 4 Hs → 2 types.
4. C4 and C5: 4 Hs → 2 types.

Total types: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.

But the options include 6 as option A. But earlier I thought the answer might be 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C3 and C6 are each in two environments, making four types. So:

- CH2OH: 1
- C1: 1
- C3: 2
- C6: 2
- C4: 2
- C5: 2

That sums to 1+1+2+2+2+2= 10, which is option C.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that the molecule has 8 distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the molecule has the following distinct H environments:

1. The two Hs on CH2OH (equivalent) → 1.
2. The two Hs on C1 (equivalent) → 1.
3. The two Hs on C3 (each in different environments: axial and equatorial) → 2.
4. The two Hs on C6 (each in different environments) → 2.
5. The two Hs on C4 (equivalent) → 1.
6. The two Hs on C5 (equivalent) → 1.

Wait, but that adds up to 1+1+2+2+1+1=8, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C4 and C5 are in different environments, leading to an additional count.

This is getting too confusing. Based on the options given, I think the correct answer is D)7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be 8.

Wait, considering the structure, perhaps the correct count is 8. So option B is the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone is a six-membered cyclic ketone. Bromine reacts with the alpha carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), leading to the formation of **alpha-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**  
   The alpha-bromocyclohexanone undergoes elimination upon heating with NaOH. This forms **cyclohexenone**, a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone group.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group in cyclohexenone into an acid chloride, forming **cyclohexenoyl chloride** as product 3.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-BuO)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The final product, **cyclohexenylmethanol**, is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a CH₂OH group attached to one of the carbons.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - The CH₂OH group has **2 equivalent hydrogens**.  
   - The carbon adjacent to the CH₂OH group (C2) is part of the double bond and has **no hydrogens**.  
   - The double-bonded carbon (C1) has **2 equivalent hydrogens**.  
   - The carbons C3 and C6 are adjacent to the CH₂OH group and have **4 hydrogens in distinct environments** (2 axial and 2 equatorial).  
   - The carbons C4 and C5 are symmetrically equivalent and have **4 hydrogens in distinct environments** (2 axial and 2 equatorial).  

   Adding these, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is **8**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine. Oh wait, bromine adds to ketones in a specific way. I think it's the haloform reaction, but wait, that's usually when you have multiple methyl ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine to a ketone, it could be a bromohydrin formation, but that usually requires water as well. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha bromination? Wait, no, I think when you treat a ketone with bromine, it's more about the enol formation. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Oh, wait, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like dichloromethane leads to the formation of a dibromide. Because the carbonyl group is electron-deficient, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. So bromine would add across the alpha positions, leading to a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane or maybe a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienone or something else, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. Oh, wait, no, cyclohexanone has a planar carbonyl, so Br2 would add across the double bond. So cyclohexanone has a (CH2)5 ring with a ketone. Adding Br2 would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with one ketone. Adding Br2 would probably add across the carbonyl group, but wait, ketones don't have a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent one. Oh wait, cyclohexanone's structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a carbonyl (C=O). So the carbonyl is part of the ring, making it a cyclic ketone. When you add Br2, perhaps it undergoes an addition across the carbonyl group, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so adding Br2 would lead to a vicinal dibromide. So the cyclohexanone would have the C=O, and adding Br2 would convert the carbonyl group into a C-Br2 group. Wait, no, that can't be right because the carbonyl is a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation or something else. Or maybe addition to the double bond, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond except the carbonyl. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't adding across the carbonyl. Another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo enolate formation when treated with a base, but bromine is a dienophile. Wait, perhaps it's a dienone adding bromine? No, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is adding to the alpha position via some kind of keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, I think I remember that when a ketone is treated with bromine, it undergoes a bromohydrin formation in the presence of water. But in this case, the question says that product 1 is formed by treating cyclohexanone with bromine. So perhaps the reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to a bromocyclohexanol or something else. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack. Wait, no, bromine is more of an electrophilic reagent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. If cyclohexanone has the carbonyl, adding Br2 across it would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So that would be product 1 as 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide. That sounds like an elimination reaction. Because when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane) are treated with a base, they undergo elimination to form an alkene. So product 2 would be cyclohexene. Wait, but wait, cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond. However, elimination would form cyclohexene, but the position of the double bond depends on the structure. Wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, so elimination would form cyclohexene with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, right?

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If we remove two adjacent bromines, the ring would form a double bond in that position, making cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Next, product 2 (cyclohexene) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine. Thionyl chloride typically converts alcohols to chlorides, but in this case, cyclohexene doesn't have an alcohol group. Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe product 2 isn't cyclohexene. Let me re-examine.

Wait, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, and when heated with NaOH, it would eliminate to form cyclohexene. But wait, if product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, the elimination would produce cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But let's think about the structure of cyclohexene. It's a six-membered ring with a double bond, so it's either cis or trans, but in the case of elimination, the geometry depends on the stereochemistry of the dihalide. But since the starting dihalide is from cyclohexanone, which is a planar structure, perhaps the dihalide is trans, leading to a trans double bond upon elimination. Wait, but cyclohexene is a ring, and the double bond is between two adjacent carbons.

Wait, but wait, maybe the elimination leads to a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, which upon elimination forms cyclohexene.

So product 2 is cyclohexene. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride usually reacts with alcohols, but cyclohexene doesn't have an -OH group. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me think again. When cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, maybe it's an alpha bromination. Oh! Oh wait, that's possible. The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, making the alpha hydrogens acidic. So when we add bromine, perhaps it's undergoing an electrophilic substitution, where the alpha hydrogen is replaced by Br. But wait, cyclohexanone has two alpha positions, each with two hydrogens (since it's a six-membered ring). So adding Br2 would lead to a mono-brominated product because if it's mono, but wait, bromine is in excess, so maybe more than one substitution.

Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is bromination via enol formation. The enol form would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making the alpha position more susceptible to electrophilic attack. So, when Br2 is added, it would add across the double bond of the enol, leading to a di-substituted product. But wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation, but without water, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromocyclohexanol. Wait, no, that's if there's an addition of HBr, but no, in this case, Br2 without water is used.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, which would form a geminal di-bromide. So cyclohexanone would become 2-bromo-cyclohexanone? No, because adding Br to the carbonyl carbon would lead to two Brs on the same carbon. So product 1 would be 2,2-dibromocyclohexane?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction of ketones with bromine. Oh right, I think that when a ketone is treated with excess bromine, it can undergo the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with ketones and forms a ketone oxide. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, the reaction could be the formation of a bromohydrin when bromine and water are present, but without water, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexanone could undergo a ring-opening reaction. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's try to proceed with what I thought earlier, assuming product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Moving on: product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. When treated with NaOH and heated, it undergoes elimination to form cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride usually converts alcohols to chlorides, but cyclohexene doesn't have an OH group. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, maybe the cyclohexene is ring-opening under these conditions. But I don't recall thionyl chloride reacting with alkenes directly. Alternatively, perhaps the process is different.

Wait, maybe product 2 isn't cyclohexene, but something else. Let me reconsider product 1 and product 2.

Alternative approach: perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a bromide. So cyclohexanone (O=C-R) reacts with Br2 to form OBr-C-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a bromide via a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, the reaction could be the formation of a dibromide at the alpha position. So the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) would get brominated. Since cyclohexanone has two alpha positions (each with two H's), adding Br2 would lead to bromination at both alpha positions, but maybe only one of them is possible. Or perhaps it's a cyclic bromonium ion formation, leading to a 1,2-dibromide.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and see if that helps. So product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with thionyl chloride and pyridine. If product 2 is cyclohexene, then what does thionyl chloride do? It doesn't react with alkenes. So perhaps product 2 is an alcohol or something else. Wait, if product 1 is a vicinal dihalide, product 2 upon elimination would be cyclohexene, which doesn't react with thionyl chloride. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps the first step isn't an elimination. Let me think again. Maybe product 1 is a bromide at the alpha position. So cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1, which is a mono-brominated cyclohexanone. That would make the next step more feasible.

Wait, but if product 1 is a mono-bromide, then when heated with NaOH, it would undergo elimination. Wait, but mono-halides aren't as likely to eliminate. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a vicinal dihalide, but that's leading to cyclohexene, which doesn't react with thionyl chloride.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe the first reaction is the formation of a cyclohexyl bromide via substitution, but that seems unlikely without a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group, making a bromide. So, cyclohexanone would have the carbonyl converted into a bromide, but I don't know how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substitution, but that's unclear.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the final step. Product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3, which is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reductions where other hydrides might not work. It's a bulky hydride, so it might prefer less hindered positions. So if product 3 is an acid chloride, for example, then product 4 would be an alcohol. Or if product 3 is an alkyl chloride, then product 4 would be an alkane after reduction.

Wait, but LiAlH is a reducing agent. It reduces esters, ketones, nitriles, etc. So let's think about what product 3 could be.

Product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Thionyl chloride is commonly used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, or alcohols to chlorides. So perhaps product 2 has an -OH group, which is converted to Cl in product 3.

So product 2 must be an alcohol. Now, if product 2 is an alcohol, that means product 1 must have been a halide, likely a bromide, which upon treatment with a base (like NaOH) would undergo elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't produce an alcohol. Wait, elimination would form an alkene, but perhaps another possibility is that product 1 is a dihalide that, upon hydrolysis, forms an alcohol. Wait, but no, product 1 is treated with NaOH, which is aqueous conditions, but the question doesn't mention water. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a bromide at the alpha position. So, after the first step, we have a mono-bromide at the alpha position. Then, when heated with NaOH, maybe it undergoes elimination to form an alkene. But that would form cyclohexene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction that forms an alcohol, but that doesn't make much sense with NaOH and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted product, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to retrace.

Starting with cyclohexanone. Reaction with Br2: possible options are adding Br across the carbonyl (forming a di bromide) or brominating the alpha carbon. Let's say it's the latter. So product 1 would be alpha-bromocyclohexanone. Then, when product 1 is treated with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination, removing the Br and the adjacent H to form an alkene. Wait, but that would require a base to abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. But cyclohexene doesn't have an -OH group, so this doesn't make sense. Hmm. So perhaps product 2 isn't cyclohexene. Maybe my initial assumption about the first step is wrong.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the first reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, forming a di bromide. So product 1 is a vicinal dibromide. Then, product 1 is treated with NaOH, which causes elimination, forming an alkene. So product 2 is cyclohexene. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride. But as before, this doesn't fit because thionyl chloride doesn't react with alkenes. So perhaps product 3 is something else.

Wait, maybe product 2 is cyclohexanol. How? Because if product 1 is an epoxide or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide that upon treatment with NaOH forms an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a geminal di bromide, meaning both Brs are on the same carbon. Then, when treated with NaOH, it could undergo hydrolysis to form a ketone or perhaps an alcohol. Wait, gem-dibromides typically hydrolyze to form ketones. So if product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone, then product 2 would be cyclohexanone again. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide on the alpha carbon. So when NaOH is added, it could substitute the Br with an OH group, forming cyclohexanol. Then, product 2 would be cyclohexanol.

Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, which would convert the alcohol to an acid chloride. So product 3 would be cyclohexanoyl chloride.

Then, product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a strong reducing agent, but it's typically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Wait, but LiAlH4 is usually for ketones and esters. Wait, but when you have an acid chloride, you can reduce it to a primary alcohol. Because the mechanism would involve the hydride attacking the carbonyl, leading to the formation of an aldehyde, but wait, no, with a strong enough reducing agent, it would go all the way to the primary alcohol.

Wait, no, acid chlorides can be reduced to primary alcohols using LiAlH(t-BuO)3. Because acid chlorides are more reactive than ketones, so they would be reduced to aldehydes, but wait, no, wait. Wait, in the presence of a strong reducing agent like LiAlH(t-BuO)3, an acid chloride (RCOCl) would be reduced to RCH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when an acid chloride is treated with LiAlH4, it's reduced to a primary alcohol. Because the hydride attacks the carbonyl, the chloride leaves, and then it gets protonated, but I might be getting the steps wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the acid chloride is first converted to an aldehyde via the reduction, but maybe under certain conditions, it goes all the way to the alcohol.

Wait, LiAlH4 typically reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So if product 3 is cyclohexanoyl chloride, product 4 would be cyclohexanol.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So if product 4 is cyclohexanol, what's the structure? Cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with an -OH group attached to one carbon. So the molecule has a certain symmetry.

Wait, cyclohexanol has a chair conformation. The hydroxyl group is on one carbon. So the adjacent carbons (the ones next to the OH) have two different environments: one axial and one equatorial. Wait, but when considering the chair structure, the axial and equatorial positions can lead to different types of protons.

Wait, but in cyclohexanol, the hydroxyl is on a carbon, say, axial. Then, the adjacent carbons would have different protons. But let me think about the symmetry. If the OH is on a carbon, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through that carbon and the opposite one, perhaps. Wait, no, because the OH is in a specific position, so the molecule isn't symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogens on the cyclohexanol are as follows: the OH-bearing carbon has two equivalent Hs? No, wait, no, because in cyclohexanol, the OH is attached to a carbon in a six-membered ring. So that carbon is CH2-OH? No, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one CH2 group is replaced by an OH. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group attached to one of the CH2 groups. So each carbon in the ring is CH2, except the one with the OH, which is CH(OH).

Wait, no, wait, cyclohexanol structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(OH) group. So the molecule is:

       O
       |
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2
       |
       CH2
       |
       CH2
       |
       CH2

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of chair conformation. The OH group is axial or equatorial. But regardless, when looking for chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to consider symmetry.

So, in cyclohexanol, the hydrogens can be categorized based on their positions relative to the OH group. For example:

1. The two hydrogens on the same carbon as the OH (but wait, that carbon has only one OH and two CH2 groups? Or is it a CH with two Hs and an OH?)

Wait, no: the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is attached to an OH group, making it a secondary alcohol. So the structure is:

Each carbon in the ring is CH2, except one which is CH(OH) attached to two other CH2 groups.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: cyclohexanol's structure is a six-membered ring where each carbon is CH2 except for one, which is CH2OH? No, that's not right. Wait, no, cyclohexanol is (CH2)5CH(OH). No, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanol is a cyclic hexanol, so the structure is a six-membered ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(OH) group. So each of the six carbons in the ring has two CH2 groups except for the one with the OH, which has two CH2 groups attached. Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure mentally. Cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring where each carbon is CH2, except one which is CH(OH). So that carbon has two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons, so the structure is a chair with an OH group on one of the carbons.

In any case, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So if product 4 is cyclohexanol, how many distinct Hs are there?

In cyclohexanol, the hydrogens can be categorized based on their positions relative to the OH group. The hydrogens on the same carbon as the OH (if any) would be equivalent? Wait, in cyclohexanol, the OH is on a CH2 group, right? No, no, cyclohexanol has each carbon as CH2 except one, which is CH2OH? No, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure of cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH2OH group. No, that's not right. Wait, cyclohexanol is (CH2)5CH2OH, but arranged in a ring. Wait no, that's not possible because that would make a seven-membered ring. Oh, wait, no, cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(OH) group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 connected in a ring.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think: cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with one OH group attached to a carbon. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group on one of the carbons, making it a secondary alcohol. So each carbon in the ring is CH2 except for the one with the OH, which is CH2-OH? No, wait, in cyclohexanol, the OH is on a carbon that's bonded to two CH2 groups. So the structure is (CH2)5CH(OH). No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. In cyclohexanol, the OH is on one carbon. The adjacent carbons (each bonded to the OH-bearing carbon) have two different types of hydrogens. Let's imagine the chair conformation. The OH group can be axial or equatorial. But regardless, the adjacent carbons would have axial and equatorial hydrogens.

But considering all the symmetry, how many distinct Hs are there?

Alternative approach: in cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the OH-bearing carbon and the opposite carbon. So the hydrogens can be arranged into different symmetry-equivalent positions.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the molecule. The carbon with the OH is C1. C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1, C3 and C5 are next, and C4 is opposite.

In terms of hydrogen environments:

- The OH-bearing carbon (C1) has two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent? They would be if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Since the molecule is symmetric with respect to the C1-C4 axis, the two Hs on C1 are in equivalent environments. So they're one type.

- C2 and C6 are adjacent to C1. Each has two Hs, but are they all equivalent? Let's see: C2 and C6 are symmetric due to the plane of symmetry. So the Hs on C2 and C6 are equivalent. So each of these carbons has two Hs, but they are in the same environment. Wait, no, because C2 and C6 are each attached to C1, but their positions relative to the ring may differ. Wait, no, in the chair conformation, C2 and C6 would be on the same side as the OH group if it's axial, leading to their Hs being similar, but perhaps they are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the number of unique H environments:

1. The two Hs on C1 (same as each other).
2. The four Hs on C2 and C6 (since each has two Hs, but C2 and C6 are equivalent, so their Hs are the same).
3. The four Hs on C3 and C5 (equivalent positions, each with two Hs).
4. The two Hs on C4 (opposite the OH, same as each other).

Wait, but that would make 4 distinct types of Hs. But that can't be right because the question options don't have 4 as an option. Alternatively, I'm miscounting.

Wait, let me think again.

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4. So the Hs can be categorized as follows:

- Hs on C1: two Hs, equivalent. → 1 type.
- Hs on C2 and C6: each has two Hs, but are they equivalent? Since C2 and C6 are mirror images across the plane, their Hs are in equivalent environments. So all four Hs (two on C2 and two on C6) are equivalent. → 1 type.
- Hs on C3 and C5: each has two Hs, and they're mirror images as well. So their Hs are equivalent. → 1 type.
- Hs on C4: two Hs, equivalent. → 1 type.

Wait, that gives 4 types, but the options don't include 4.

Alternatively, maybe there are more types because some of the Hs are in different environments. Let's think about the chair conformation. If the OH is axial, the axial Hs on C2 would be up, and the equatorial Hs would be down. Wait, but in reality, the chair conformation leads to axial and equatorial Hs. So maybe the Hs on C2 are a mix of axial and equatorial, leading to different environments.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the number of unique H environments in cyclohexanol.

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a certain symmetry, but let's count:

- The OH-bearing carbon (C1) has two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent? Yes, due to the plane of symmetry. → 1 type.
- The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent between C2 and C6? Yes, because of the molecule's symmetry. So each of these Hs is equivalent, but are the axial and equatorial Hs on C2 equivalent? No, because in the chair conformation, axial and equatorial Hs are in different environments. So perhaps each C2 and C6 has two types of Hs: axial and equatorial. But wait, if the OH is axial, then the axial H on C2 would be close to the OH, perhaps leading to different chemical shifts.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the actual number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol. I think the correct number is 6. Because in the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial Hs are different. Let me see:

- C1: 2 Hs (equivalent) → 1 type.
- C2: 2 axial Hs and 2 equatorial Hs (but wait, each C has only two Hs. Wait, no, each C has two Hs, but in the chair conformation, their orientation can make them equivalent or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 8. I think I've read that in cyclohexanol, there are 8 unique Hs when considering the chair conformation.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product 4 is not cyclohexanol. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's go back. Let me summarize the steps again.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.
2. Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → product 2.
3. Product 2 + SOCl2 + pyridine → product 3.
4. Product 3 + LiAlH(t-BuO)3 → product 4.

If product 4 is a secondary alcohol, perhaps the number of Hs is 8.

Wait, but let's see another approach. Let's think about each step again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2. Let's assume it's a bromination at the alpha position. So product 1 is alpha-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: Product 1 (alpha-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated). This could be an elimination reaction, forming cyclohexene. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Step 3: Product 2 (cyclohexene) + SOCl2 + pyridine. Hmm, but cyclohexene doesn't have an -OH group, so this doesn't make sense. So perhaps product 2 isn't cyclohexene.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a vicinal di-bromide. Then product 2 is cyclohexene. But then product 3 would have to be something else.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a bromide at the alpha position, and product 2 is a ketone after elimination, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, making a di bromide. So product 1 is 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: product 1 treated with NaOH. Heating 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone with NaOH would lead to elimination, but with two Brs on the same carbon, perhaps it forms a ketone again. Wait, no, elimination would require adjacent Brs. So maybe product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, step 2 is elimination to form cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: cyclohexene + SOCl2. But without an -OH group, it doesn't react. So perhaps this path is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a bromide in a different position. Let's say cyclohexanone (after bromination) becomes 3-bromocyclohexanone. Then, step 2 would be elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let's think about the final step. Product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3 to form product 4. LiAlH is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce acid chlorides. So product 3 is likely an acid chloride. Then, product 4 would be the corresponding alcohol.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, then product 2 must be a carboxylic acid. Because thionyl chloride converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides.

So, product 2 is a carboxylic acid. Then, product 1 must have been a halide that upon treatment with NaOH forms a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how does a dihalide become a carboxylic acid upon treatment with NaOH? That would require hydrolysis. For example, a vicinal dihalide can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 1 is a bromide on the alpha carbon. So, when product 1 is treated with aqueous NaOH, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Let me consider:

Product 1: alpha-bromocyclohexanone → upon treatment with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis to form cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Then, product 2 is cyclohexanecarboxylic acid.

Then, product 2 is treated with SOCl2 and pyridine, which converts the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride (product 3: cyclohexanoyl chloride).

Finally, product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-BuO)3, which reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. Wait, but wait, LiAlH4 typically reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So product 4 would be cyclohexylmethanol or something else? Wait, no, reducing an acid chloride (RCOCl) would give RCH2OH. But cyclohexanoyl chloride is (cyclohexyl)COCl. Reducing that would give (cyclohexyl)CH2OH, which is cyclohexylmethanol.

Wait, cyclohexylmethanol has a structure where a cyclohexyl group is attached to a CH2OH. So the structure is CH2OH connected to a cyclohexane ring.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, which is cyclohexylmethanol.

So, let's analyze the structure:

The molecule is CH2OH attached to a cyclohexane ring. The cyclohexane ring would have substituents, which affects the symmetry and the number of distinct Hs.

Looking at the cyclohexylmethanol molecule:

- The CH2OH group has two Hs on the CH2, which are equivalent (axial and equatorial positions, but in this case, since it's a CH2, they're equivalent).
- The cyclohexane ring is substituted with a CH2OH group. The ring has a substituent, which breaks some symmetry.

So, the cyclohexane ring now has a substituent (CH2OH) attached to one carbon. This makes the molecule asymmetric around that carbon.

In such a molecule, the Hs on the ring can be categorized as follows:

1. The two Hs on the same carbon as the CH2OH substituent (if any). Wait, no, the substituent is on one carbon, which is connected to two Hs. So that carbon's Hs are equivalent. → 1 type.
2. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two Hs. Because of the substituent, the axial and equatorial Hs may not be equivalent. So each adjacent carbon has two types of Hs. But wait, because the substituent is on C1, the Cs adjacent to it (C2 and C6) have different environments. Are their Hs equivalent? No, because the substituent breaks the symmetry. So each of these adjacent carbons has two distinct Hs, but are they all different from each other? Let's see:
   - C2 has two Hs, which can be axial and equatorial. These are in different environments, so they're distinct.
   - Similarly, C6 has two Hs, which are also in different environments.
   But are the axial H on C2 and the axial H on C6 equivalent? No, because the substituent is on C1, making them in different environments. Similarly, the equatorial Hs on C2 and C6 are also in different environments.
   So each of these has two distinct Hs, making a total of 4 types from C2 and C6.
3. The next carbons (C3 and C5) are further away. Each has two Hs, but due to the substituent, their environments are different. So each C3 and C5's Hs are in different environments. So each has two distinct Hs, but perhaps C3 and C5 are mirror images, so their Hs are equivalent.
   Wait, but in reality, the substituent on C1 would make C3 and C5 have different environments. So each has two Hs, but their axial and equatorial positions might lead to different environments.
   Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's presence causes all the Hs on C3 and C5 to be unique. So each C3 and C5 has two distinct Hs, making 4 types.
4. The carbon opposite to the substituent (C4) has two Hs, which are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. → 1 type.

Wait, but let me count again:

- CH2OH group: 2 Hs (equivalent) → 1 type.
- C1 (same as CH2OH): 2 Hs → 1 type.
Wait, no, the substituent is on C1. C1 is connected to CH2OH and two other carbons. So C1's Hs are on the same carbon as the substituent. So the Hs on C1 are equivalent → 1 type.

Then, C2 and C6: each has two Hs, which are not equivalent to each other or to Hs on other carbons. So each C2 and C6 contribute two distinct types. So that's 4 types.

C3 and C5: each has two Hs, but are they equivalent? Perhaps not, because the substituent affects their environments. So each contributes two types, but perhaps C3's Hs are equivalent to C5's Hs. So 2 types.

C4: two Hs, equivalent → 1 type.

So total types:

CH2OH: 1
C1: 1
C2: 2
C6: 2
C3: 2
C5: 2
C4:1

Wait, but that adds up to 1+1+2+2+2+2+1 = 11, which is way more than the options given. So I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2OH)Cyclohexane, where the CH2OH is attached to one carbon of the ring, making it a secondary alcohol. So the structure is cyclohexanol, which I discussed earlier.

But earlier, I was confused about the number of distinct Hs in cyclohexanol. Let me try to count again.

In cyclohexanol:

- The OH is on C1. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through C1 and C4.
- C1: two Hs (equivalent) → 1 type.
- C2 and C6: each has two Hs. Are these equivalent? For each, the axial and equatorial Hs are in different environments, so each has two types. So C2 contributes 2, C6 contributes 2. But due to the plane of symmetry, the axial H on C2 is equivalent to the axial H on C6, and the equatorial H on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial H on C6. So each of these pairs are equivalent. So C2 and C6 together contribute 2 types (axial and equatorial).
- C3 and C5: each has two Hs. Again, the plane of symmetry makes axial H on C3 equivalent to axial on C5, and equatorial on C3 equivalent to equatorial on C5. So C3 and C5 contribute 2 types.
- C4: two Hs, equivalent → 1 type.

So in total, the types are:

1. C1: 1
2. Axial on C2 and C6: 1
3. Equatorial on C2 and C6: 1
4. Axial on C3 and C5: 1
5. Equatorial on C3 and C5: 1
6. C4: 1

That's a total of 6 types. But the options don't have 6 as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7. Oh, option A is 6.

But wait, this is assuming that the axial and equatorial Hs on the same carbon are different. So each axial and equatorial is a separate type.

But in cyclohexanol, the axial and equatorial Hs on the same carbon are different because of their positions. So each carbon has two types of Hs, except C1 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the count is:

- C1: 2 Hs (1 type)
- C2: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)
- C3: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)
- C4: 2 Hs (1 type)
- C5: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)
- C6: 2 Hs (axial and equatorial, 2 types)

Wait, but this can't be right because that would sum to 1+2+2+1+2+2=10, which is option C. But earlier I thought the count was 6.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of an alternative approach. The correct answer is likely 8, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 4 is not cyclohexanol. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → alpha-bromocyclohexanone.
2. alpha-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexenone (a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group).
3. cyclohexenone + SOCl2 → forms an acid chloride (I'm not sure about this step).
4. acid chloride + LiAlH → primary alcohol.

But this seems unlikely because I'm not sure about step 3.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a different structure altogether, leading to a different count of Hs.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct structure of product 4.

Let me try to outline the reactions step by step again, more carefully.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

   Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding Br2 can lead to bromination at the alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl). So product 1 would be 2-bromo-cyclohexanone.

2. Product 1 (2-bromo-cyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → product 2.

   Reaction with NaOH could lead to elimination, forming an alkene. The bromide is on C2, so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexenone (cyclohexene ring with a ketone). So product 2 is cyclohexenone.

3. Product 2 (cyclohexenone) + SOCl2 + pyridine → product 3.

   Thionyl chloride typically converts ketones to chlorides. Wait, but cyclohexenone is a cyclic ketone. Treating it with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to an acid chloride. So product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride.

4. Product 3 (cyclohexenoyl chloride) + LiAlH(t-BuO)3 → product 4.

   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a strong reducing agent that can reduce acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So the acid chloride (RCOCl) would be reduced to RCH2OH. So product 4 would be cyclohexenylmethanol.

Wait, but cyclohexenoyl chloride is (cyclohexenyl)COCl. Reducing this would give (cyclohexenyl)CH2OH, which is cyclohexenylmethanol.

Now, the structure of cyclohexenylmethanol is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a CH2OH group attached to one of the carbons adjacent to the double bond.

The structure would be:

CH2OH attached to C2 of cyclohexene.

So the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and a CH2OH group attached to C2.

Wait, no, because cyclohexenone is a ring with a double bond and a ketone. When reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with a double bond (say, between C1 and C2) and a CH2OH group attached to C2.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH-(CH2)3-CH2-OH?

Wait, no, in a ring. It would be cyclohexene with a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as a cyclohexene ring where one of the double-bonded carbons (say, C1) has a CH2OH substituent attached to C2.

But regardless, the important point is that the molecule has a double bond and a CH2OH group. This would affect the symmetry and the number of distinct Hs.

So, product 4 is cyclohexenylmethanol.

Now, let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

The structure would be:

Positions:

C1: double bond to C2.

C2: attached to CH2OH and double bond to C1.

C3, C4, C5, C6: other carbons in the ring.

So, the molecule has a substituent (CH2OH) on C2, and a double bond between C1 and C2.

This would create several distinct environments for the hydrogens.

Let's consider each carbon:

1. C1: part of the double bond, so each H on C1 (if any) would be distinct. But wait, in the ring, C1 is double-bonded to C2, so it doesn't have any Hs. So no Hs on C1.

2. C2: attached to CH2OH and double bond. So, C2 has two substituents: the double bond and the CH2OH. The Hs on C2 (if any) would be in a unique environment. Wait, no, C2 is double-bonded to C1, so it doesn't have any Hs.

Wait, no, if the ring is cyclohexene, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 and C2 are each double-bonded, meaning no Hs on those carbons.

Wait, no, that's not right. In cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond has one substituent. So C1 is bonded to C2 and two other carbons (C6 and C2), making it a double bond. So C1 has two substituents (C6 and C2), but no Hs because it's part of a double bond.

Wait, no, in cyclohexene, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. So each of these carbons is bonded to two other carbons and a double bond. So each has one H. Wait, no, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons and one double bond, so each has two Hs. Wait, no, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

The structure of cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. Each carbon in the double bond (C1 and C2) is bonded to two other carbons (C6 and C3 for C1; C1 and C3 for C2) and has two Hs each. So, each of these carbons has two Hs.

But in cyclohexenylmethanol, the CH2OH group is attached to C2. So C2 has:

- A double bond to C1.
- A single bond to C3.
- A single bond to CH2OH.

So, C2 has two Hs.

Wait, no, if C2 is double-bonded to C1, it can't have two Hs. Because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons, so no Hs. Wait, no, that's not right. For cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond has two Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the structure. In cyclohexene, each of the double-bonded carbons (C1 and C2) is bonded to two other carbons and has two Hs each.

So, C1 has two Hs, and C2 has two Hs. Now, in cyclohexenylmethanol, the CH2OH is attached to C2. So, C2 now has:

- A double bond to C1.
- A single bond to C3.
- A single bond to CH2OH.

So, how many Hs does C2 have? In the double bond, each carbon has two substituents (the other two bonds are to other carbons). So, C2, being part of a double bond, has no Hs. So, the CH2OH must be attached to another carbon, perhaps C3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is cyclohexenone, which is cyclohexene with a ketone group. When the ketone is reduced, it becomes a CH2OH group. So, the ketone is on C2, which is part of the double bond between C1 and C2. So, in cyclohexenone, C2 is part of the double bond and has a ketone group. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group.

So the structure becomes:

C1 is double-bonded to C2. C2 has the CH2OH group attached. So, C2 has a double bond to C1, and a single bond to C3 and to CH2OH.

So, C2 has no Hs because it's part of a double bond. The CH2OH is attached to C2, which is already double-bonded. So, the Hs on the CH2OH are two, but what about the rest of the ring?

Wait, perhaps the CH2OH is on C3. Let me clarify.

In cyclohexenone, the ketone is on C2, which is part of the double bond between C1 and C2. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group on C2.

So, the structure is:

C1=C2-OH (but wait, no, the ketone is on C2, so after reduction, it's CH2OH attached to C2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring. Let's say the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a ketone group. So, in cyclohexenone, C2 is part of the double bond and has a carbonyl group. Then, after reduction with LiAlH, the ketone becomes CH2OH, making C2 have a CH2OH group and being part of the double bond.

But that would mean C2 has a CH2OH group and a double bond to C1. So, C2 has no Hs because it's part of a double bond. Then, the CH2OH is attached to C2, which is part of the double bond.

But then, what about the Hs on CH2OH? They are two Hs, both equivalent.

The cyclohexene ring now has the CH2OH group on C2, which is part of the double bond. So, the ring looks like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but arranged in a ring, so the last CH2 connects back to C1).

Wait, no, that's not a ring. Let me think again.

The correct structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a CH2OH group attached to C2.

So, the ring is:

C1=C2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but arranged in a ring, so C6 connects back to C1).

In this structure:

- C1: double-bonded to C2, has two Hs (since it's part of the double bond).
- C2: double-bonded to C1, and attached to CH2OH. So, C2 has no Hs because it's double-bonded and has two single bonds (to C1 and C3, and the CH2OH is attached to C2? Or is the CH2OH attached to C3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The ketone is on C2, which is part of the double bond. So, after reduction, the ketone becomes CH2OH on C2. So, C2 is double-bonded to C1 and attached to CH2OH.

So, C2 has no Hs, but the CH2OH is attached to C2, which is part of the double bond. Therefore, the CH2OH group has two Hs, which are equivalent.

Now, the rest of the ring: C3, C4, C5, C6.

Each of these has two Hs, but their environments are affected by the substituents.

So, considering the molecule's symmetry, let's count the distinct Hs.

1. The two Hs on CH2OH group: equivalent → 1 type.
2. The two Hs on C1 (from the double bond): each is in a unique environment because of the substituent. Wait, but C1 is part of the double bond and has two Hs. Are these Hs equivalent? Because C1 is part of the double bond and attached to C6 and C2, which are both CH2 groups. So, the Hs on C1 are in the same environment → 1 type.
3. The ring carbons C3, C4, C5, and C6: each has two Hs. Let's analyze their environments.

C3 is attached to C2 (double bond and CH2OH) and C4. So, the Hs on C3 are in a unique environment. Are the Hs on C3 equivalent? Let's imagine the chair conformation. The substituent (CH2OH) on C2 would cause the axial and equatorial Hs on C3 to be in different environments. So, each C3 has two distinct Hs → 2 types.

Similarly, C4 is attached to C3 and C5. Its Hs are influenced by the substituent. So, the Hs on C4 are in a different environment than those on C3.

Wait, but without the substituent, the ring would have symmetry, but with the substituent, the symmetry is broken.

So, each of C3, C4, C5, and C6 would have their own unique H environments.

Wait, but perhaps not. Let me think about the substituent's effect.

The substituent is on C2, which is part of the double bond. So, the ring's substituent is on C2, making the structure asymmetric. This would cause each of the other carbons (C3, C4, C5, C6) to have unique environments for their Hs.

But perhaps some of them are equivalent due to the ring's arrangement.

For example:

- C3 and C6 are symmetric with respect to the substituent on C2. So, the Hs on C3 and C6 are in similar environments, making them equivalent.
- Similarly, C4 and C5 are symmetric, so their Hs are equivalent.

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me visualize:

If the substituent is on C2, then C3 and C6 are in similar positions relative to the substituent, so their Hs would be equivalent. Similarly, C4 and C5 are in symmetric positions. So:

- C3 and C6: each has two Hs, which are equivalent across the molecule → 2 types (axial and equatorial, if applicable).
- C4 and C5: each has two Hs, which are equivalent across the molecule → 2 types.

So, putting it all together:

1. CH2OH group: 2 Hs → 1 type.
2. C1: 2 Hs → 1 type.
3. C3 and C6: 4 Hs → 2 types.
4. C4 and C5: 4 Hs → 2 types.

Total types: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.

But the options include 6 as option A. But earlier I thought the answer might be 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C3 and C6 are each in two environments, making four types. So:

- CH2OH: 1
- C1: 1
- C3: 2
- C6: 2
- C4: 2
- C5: 2

That sums to 1+1+2+2+2+2= 10, which is option C.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that the molecule has 8 distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the molecule has the following distinct H environments:

1. The two Hs on CH2OH (equivalent) → 1.
2. The two Hs on C1 (equivalent) → 1.
3. The two Hs on C3 (each in different environments: axial and equatorial) → 2.
4. The two Hs on C6 (each in different environments) → 2.
5. The two Hs on C4 (equivalent) → 1.
6. The two Hs on C5 (equivalent) → 1.

Wait, but that adds up to 1+1+2+2+1+1=8, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on C4 and C5 are in different environments, leading to an additional count.

This is getting too confusing. Based on the options given, I think the correct answer is D)7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be 8.

Wait, considering the structure, perhaps the correct count is 8. So option B is the answer.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone is a six-membered cyclic ketone. Bromine reacts with the alpha carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), leading to the formation of **alpha-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**  
   The alpha-bromocyclohexanone undergoes elimination upon heating with NaOH. This forms **cyclohexenone**, a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone group.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂ + Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group in cyclohexenone into an acid chloride, forming **cyclohexenoyl chloride** as product 3.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-BuO)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The final product, **cyclohexenylmethanol**, is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a CH₂OH group attached to one of the carbons.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   - The CH₂OH group has **2 equivalent hydrogens**.  
   - The carbon adjacent to the CH₂OH group (C2) is part of the double bond and has **no hydrogens**.  
   - The double-bonded carbon (C1) has **2 equivalent hydrogens**.  
   - The carbons C3 and C6 are adjacent to the CH₂OH group and have **4 hydrogens in distinct environments** (2 axial and 2 equatorial).  
   - The carbons C4 and C5 are symmetrically equivalent and have **4 hydrogens in distinct environments** (2 axial and 2 equatorial).  

   Adding these, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is **8**.

**Answer: B**
