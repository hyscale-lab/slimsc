Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And they're all identical. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is that one charge is at P, and the others are all at a distance of 2 meters from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges depends on their arrangement. But wait, how does that work? Oh right, when you bring charges together, you're doing work against their mutual electric forces, so the potential energy is related to that work.

But wait, since these are all point charges, the potential energy between each pair is (k q1 q2)/r. Since all the charges are identical, each pair will contribute the same amount. So for the system, I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, for each of the 12 charges at 2m from P, their potential energy relative to the charge at P is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m). But wait, actually, when considering the total potential energy of the system, you have to consider all possible pairs. Because each charge at 2m contributes to the potential energy with each other, not just with the central charge.

Wait, so the system has two types of interactions: between the central charge and each of the 12, and between each pair of the 12. Let me think.

The total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all distinct pairs. So for the 13 charges, how many pairs are there? Well, the central charge is one, and the 12 are others.

Wait, the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at distance 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at distance 2m from the central charge. Now, the potential energy contributions are:

1. The energy between each of the 12 and the central charge.
2. The energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Because each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but how are they arranged relative to each other? Hmm, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they form a spherical shell of radius 2m, each at that distance. But their arrangement among themselvesâ€”does it matter? Because the potential between any two of them would depend on the distance between them. Wait, but unless they are all at the same point, which is not possible, the distances vary. Oh wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy, so maybe the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy depends on the distances between charges. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would want to be as close as possible, right? Because for like charges, when they are closer, their potential energy is higher (since you have to do more work to bring them together). Wait, no, wait: wait, no, the potential energy for two positive charges is positive, and you have to do work to bring them closer. So, the system's potential energy is higher when charges are closer. Oh, but wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So perhaps the system is in a configuration where the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. Oh, so they can't move closer; they're fixed at that distance. Which means the only thing that's fixed is their distance from P. But their positions relative to each other can vary, perhaps. But the problem might have us assume that they are all points on a sphere of radius 2m. So, perhaps the distance between any two of the 12 is approximately 2m, but that's not exactly right. Because on a sphere, the distance between two points can vary. Hmm, but wait, if they are arranged in a way that's as close as possible, but the problem doesn't specify. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the 12 charges as being on a sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances are such that each pair is at least 2m apart? No, that's not correct because two points on a sphere can be much closer than the radius. For example, two points diametrically opposite are 4m apart (since radius is 2m), but points near each other would be much closer.

Wait, but the problem says "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P. So their positions are on a sphere of radius 2m. But how about their mutual distances? How close can they be? For the minimal potential energy, perhaps the charges are arranged as far apart as possible, but wait, no, because that would minimize the repulsion. Wait, the potential energy is higher when they're closer, so to minimize the system's energy, maybe the charges are as far apart as possible, thus reducing the number of close pairs.

Wait, no, wait, the potential energy between two charges is (k q^2)/(r), so for a fixed charge, if r is larger, the energy per pair is lower. So, to minimize the total potential energy of the system, each pair should be as far apart as possible. But the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, so the maximum possible distance between any two would be 4m (diametrically opposite). So maybe in this case, the minimal potential energy is achieved when all the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, so that each pair is as far apart as possible on average.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem assumes that all the 12 are points on a sphere, but their mutual distances are not considered because the question is only considering the energy between each and the central charge. But that doesn't make sense because the problem asks for the minimum energy, which must include all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 charges are at the same point as the central charge, but no, the problem says they are constrained to stay 2m away.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are all 2m as well. But that's not possible because you can't have 12 points all 2m apart on a sphere of radius 2m. So maybe the problem is ignoring their mutual distances and only considering the energy between each and the central charge, then summing that up. Because if you have to consider all pairwise interactions, the calculation becomes more involved, especially without knowing their exact positions.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in some way that their mutual distances can be considered as 2m as well. But for a sphere of radius r, the chord length between two points is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as seen from the center. So for r=2m, the chord length can be as small as 0 (if two points are the same) up to 4m (diametrically opposite). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we are to assume that each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not considered, or perhaps they are considered to be far apart.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me read the problem again.

"12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P."

Hmm. So, the 12 are all at a distance of 2m from P. That means each of them is at 2m from the central charge. But their mutual distances are variable, depending on their positions on the sphere. But the problem is to find the minimum energy of the system, so perhaps we are to arrange the charges in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

But wait, the potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions. So each pair contributes (k q1 q2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to calculate the exact energy. Unless the problem is making an assumption that all the 12 are at a mutual distance that can be considered as 2m as well. Hmm, but that's not correct because their mutual distance could be less than that.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energies between the 12 charges are negligible compared to the energies due to their interaction with the central charge. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and not the interactions among the 12. Because 12 charges on a sphere, each 2m from P, but their mutual distances are small enough that their interactions contribute a lot to the potential energy.

But the problem says "minimum energy of this system." Wait, perhaps the minimum possible potential energy occurs when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible. So if we arrange the 12 charges in a way that each is as far as possible from the others, then the sum of their mutual potential energies would be minimized.

Wait, but how? Because arranging the 12 charges on the surface of a sphere so that each is as far as possible from the others would mean putting them as far apart as possible. For a sphere, the maximum number of equidistant points is tricky, but even so, each pair's distance would be something less than 4m (the diameter). But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore the mutual interactions and only consider the central charge's interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are all 2m. But that's not possible unless all 12 are at the same point, which is not possible.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the problem in terms of how potential energy is calculated. The total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs.

So, each of the 12 charges at 2m contributes to the potential energy with the central charge, and between themselves.

So, the central charge is fixed. The 12 others are each at 2m from it. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ). Since there are 12 such pairs, that's 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Then, for the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges: each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But without knowing r_ij, how can we find this? Unless the problem assumes that the mutual distances are negligible or that the mutual potential energies are zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are point charges on a sphere, but their mutual distances are also 2m. But that's impossible unless all 12 are at the same point, which isn't feasible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just read the problem again and see if I can find another approach.

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So, their distance from P is fixed, but their mutual distances can vary. But to find the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual potential energies are arranged in such a way that their sum is minimized.

Wait, but how? The potential energy between two same-signed charges is positive, and it increases as the distance between them decreases. So to minimize the total potential energy, each pair of the 12 charges should be as far apart as possible.

In that case, the arrangement would be when all the 12 are as far apart as possible on the sphere. But the maximum separation is when each pair is as far apart as possible. But on a sphere, the maximum distance between any two points is the diameter, 4m. But can all 12 charges be arranged so that each is 4m apart? No, because a sphere can't hold that many points all diametrically opposite each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular polygon or some other symmetric arrangement. For example, placing them equally spaced on the sphere, like the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to compute the exact potential energy.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges and only compute the potential energy between each and the central charge. Because otherwise, without knowing their mutual distances, it's impossible to compute the exact answer.

So, the problem asks for the minimum energy. Perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible. Since the potential energy between the 12 charges is positive, the smallest possible sum of mutual energies would be when the mutual distances are as large as possible, which would minimize each term.

But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energies are zero. But that's only the case if all the 12 charges are at the same point, which would make their mutual distances zero, which would result in infinite potential energy. That's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is making a mistake and only considering the potential energy between the 12 and the central charge. Let me try that approach.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so the potential energy between each and the central charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ). Let's compute that.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

Each charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e. e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 C. So 2e is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

So the energy for each pair is (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2*2) meters.

Wait, the denominator is 2 meters because the distance from P is 2m.

So let's compute that.

First, compute (2e)^2: (2e)^2 =4 eÂ².

So, for each pair, the energy is (k *4 eÂ²) / (2m). So:

(8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) ) / (4) ) 

Wait, because 2m is the denominator, so 2*2=4? Wait, no, the denominator is 2m, so for each pair, it's (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) = (k *4 eÂ²)/(2*2) = (k *4 eÂ²)/4 = k e^2.

Wait, wait, let's compute it step by step.

Each pair between central charge and a surrounding charge: (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (k *4 eÂ²) / (2m).

But 2m is the distance, so 2m is 2 meters? Wait, 2m is 2 meters. So 2m is 2 meters.

So, (k *4 eÂ²) / (2 * 2) m ? Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, so:

( (8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ²) * (2e) * (2e) ) / (2 m) )

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters. So it's (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m)

So:

(8.988e9) * ( (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 ) / (2 * 2) 

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C. Squared is (3.204e-19)^2 = (approx) 10.26e-38 CÂ².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *10.26e-38 = 9.23e-28.

Divide by (2 * 2) meters? Wait, no. The denominator is 2 meters.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters. So, 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, let's compute:

(3.204e-19)^2 = approx (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 CÂ².

Multiply by 8.988e9:

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 9.22e-28.

Divide by 2 (since denominator is 2 m):

9.22e-28 / 2 = about 4.61e-28 J.

But wait, that's for one pair. Since there are 12 pairs (each of the 12 charges interacting with the central charge), the total U from these interactions is 12 * 4.61e-28 J.

12 *4.61e-28 = approx 5.53e-27 J.

But that's only considering the central charge interactions.

But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Each pair among the 12 contributes energy as well. Since each has charge 2e, the energy is (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But without knowing r_ij for each pair, how can we compute the total?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and not the mutual interactions among the 12. Because otherwise, the problem would require more information.

Looking at the answer options, the options are in the order of 1e-26 to 1e-27. The calculation I did for just the central interactions gives around 5.53e-27 J. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 7e-27, which is about 1.29 times my calculated value. Hmm, but why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Each surrounding charge is 2e, central charge is 2e. So each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m).

Compute that:

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

(2e)Â² =4eÂ² =4*(1.602e-19 C)^2 =4*(2.566e-38 CÂ²)=1.026e-37 CÂ².

So each pair contributes:

(8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / (2*2) ?

Wait, no. The denominator is 2 meters, because each surrounding charge is 2m away from P. So, distance is 2 m.

So, each pair's energy is (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = 9.22e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.61e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 *4.61e-28 =5.53e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than this.

So perhaps the problem is considering only the central interactions, but that would not explain the options. Or maybe I missed something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged at 2m from P, but the central charge is also 2e, so the potential energy between each surrounding charge and the central charge is (k * (2e)^2)/(2m). And that's 12 such pairs.

But another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position. So for each of the 12 charges, the work done is (k * (2e) * (2e))/(2m).

Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum for all pairs, including both the central and the 12, but perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 4 meters. Wait, that can't be because they are all on a sphere of radius 2m, so the maximum possible distance between any two is 4m, but not all can be at that distance.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual distances are all 2 meters, but that would require the 12 charges to be at the same point, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energies are zero. How? If the charges are arranged in such a way that they form a symmetrical configuration and their mutual potentials cancel out. But that's only possible if the configuration is such that each charge's potential due to others is zero, which is not the case for point charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, but not their mutual interactions. So the total U is 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2m).

Which gives 5.53e-27 J. But the options don't have that. The closest option is C, which is 7.056e-27.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute each term:

(2e)^2 =4 eÂ² =4*(1.602176634e-19)^2.

Compute eÂ²: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approx 2.5669698e-38 CÂ².

So 4eÂ²=4 * 2.5669698e-38 =approx 1.0267879e-37 CÂ².

Compute numerator: k * (2e)^2 =8.988e9 * 1.0267879e-37.

8.988e9 *1.0267879e-37 = (8.988 *1.0267879) e-28.

8.988 *1.0267879 â‰ˆ 9.228.

So 9.228e-28.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.228e-28 / 2 =4.614e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.614e-28 *12=5.537e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.537e-27 J. But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:7.056e-27. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy for all possible pairs, including the mutual ones, but arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 4m. Because each is on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum possible distance is 4m (diametrically opposite). So if all 12 are arranged such that each pair is 4m apart, then each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/4.

But the number of mutual pairs is C(12,2)=66. So each mutual pair contributes (8.988e9 * (2e)^2)/4.

Wait, let's compute that.

(2e)^2 is 4eÂ²=1.0267879e-37 CÂ².

So mutual pair energy is (8.988e9 *1.0267879e-37)/4.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *1.0267879e-37 =9.228e-28.

Divide by 4:2.307e-28 J per mutual pair.

Number of mutual pairs is 66, so total mutual energy is 66 *2.307e-28 =1.523e-26 J.

Now, the central charge interactions contribute 5.537e-27 J as before.

So total potential energy would be 5.537e-27 +1.523e-26 = approx 2.077e-26 J.

But wait, that's higher than all the options given. The options are up to ~1e-26. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are minimal because the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are larger, but in reality, on a sphere of radius 2m, the average mutual distance would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy due to the central charge only, and not the mutual interactions. Because otherwise, without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute the mutual part.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times larger than the 5.5e-27 I calculated earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Each pair between the central charge and a surrounding charge:

U =k*(2e)^2 / (2m) 

= (8.988e9) * (4eÂ²) / (2*2) 

Wait, 2m is 2 meters. So denominator is 2.

So, 8.988e9 * (4eÂ²) / (2*2) = 8.988e9 * (4eÂ²) /4 =8.988e9 * eÂ².

Because 4/4 =1.

So 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute that step again.

e squared: (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.307e-28.

Wait, because 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) e-28 â‰ˆ23.07e-29=2.307e-28.

So each pair contributes 2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.307e-28 *12=2.768e-27 J.

Wait, that's approximately 2.77e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, another approach: compute each term in more precise terms.

Each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C =3.204e-19 C.

Each pair with the central charge: U = (k * q1 * q2 ) / r.

q1=3.204e-19 C (central charge), q2=3.204e-19 C (surrounding charge), r=2m.

So U = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2: (3.204)^2 =10.26, so 10.26e-38 CÂ².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *10.26e-38= 9.23e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.615e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 *4.615e-28=5.538e-27 J.

Again, about 5.54e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Looking at options again:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm. My calculation for just the central interactions gives about 5.54e-27, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all pairs, including mutual ones.

Wait, perhaps I should include the mutual potential energies. Let's compute the mutual part.

The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is the sum over all pairs (12 choose 2) =66 pairs.

Each mutual pair's distance r_ij. But without knowing the specific arrangement, how can we find r_ij? The problem states they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are variable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual distances to be 2m as well. But that's impossible because you can't have 12 points on a sphere of radius 2m all 2m apart from each other. It's only possible if all are at the same point, which would lead to infinite potential energy. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are considered to be much larger than 2m, making their contribution negligible. But that would be a stretch.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, and not the mutual ones. So the total U is 5.54e-27 J, which would correspond to none of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the charges. Each is 2e, so when computing the potential energy between the central and a surrounding charge, it's (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, that's correct. But maybe I forgot to square the 2, so it's 4eÂ².

Wait, let's compute it again.

Each surrounding charge is 2e, central charge is 2e. So each pair contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) =k*(4eÂ²)/(2m) = (2k eÂ²)/m.

Wait, because 4eÂ²/(2m) is 2 eÂ²/(m). So U per pair is (2k eÂ²)/m.

So with m=2 meters, it's (2k eÂ²)/2 =k eÂ².

So U per pair is k eÂ².

So each pair contributes k eÂ².

Number of such pairs is 12.

So total U from central interactions is 12 * k eÂ².

Compute that.

k=8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

eÂ² = (1.602e-19 C)^2=2.566e-38 CÂ².

So k eÂ²=8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12:12 *2.307e-28=2.768e-27 J.

Again, about 2.77e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is considering the mutual potential energies as well.

But without knowing r_ij, how can that be calculated?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being at a distance of 2m from each other as well. But that's impossible unless all are at the same point, which isn't allowed.

Another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from P and the mutual distances are as large as possible, but perhaps the problem is approximating the mutual potential energies as zero. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies are zero because the charges are arranged in a way that they form a conductor, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered to be negligible compared to the central ones. But 12 charges each contributing about 2e-27 J, and 66 mutual pairs each contributing significantly more.

Wait, let's think: if each mutual pair is at a distance of 2m, then their potential energy would be (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = same as the central interactions, which is 4.61e-28 J per pair. But there are 66 mutual pairs, so 66*4.61e-28=3.04e-26 J.

Adding to the 5.54e-27 J from central interactions, the total U would be about 3.59e-26 J. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered as negative, but that's not possible because all charges are positive. So the mutual potential energies are all positive, adding to the total.

Hmm, the problem is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

My calculation for the central interactions alone is about 5.54e-27 J. Option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the distance. The problem says 2 m from point P. So each surrounding charge is 2 meters away. So the distance between the central and a surrounding charge is 2 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from each other as well. But that would require all 12 to be on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances would vary. So perhaps the average distance is 2m, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for r in the formula. Wait, maybe the distance between the central charge and another is 2m, but for mutual pairs, perhaps the distance is 4m, which is the maximum possible on a sphere of radius 2m.

So each mutual pair is at 4m apart. So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(4m).

So for each mutual pair, U = (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /4.

Wait, let's compute that.

(3.204e-19)^2=10.26e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *10.26e-38=9.23e-28.

Divide by 4:9.23e-28/4=2.307e-28 J per mutual pair.

Number of mutual pairs:66.

Total mutual U:66 *2.307e-28=1.523e-26 J.

Adding central interactions:5.54e-27 J.

Total Uâ‰ˆ1.523e-26 +5.54e-27=2.077e-26 J.

Which is about 2.08e-26 J. The closest option is B)2.822e-26, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the mutual distances are actually 2m. Wait, no, because if all mutual pairs are 2m apart, then each would contribute (k*(2e)^2)/(2m)=4.615e-28 J.

66 pairs:66 *4.615e-28=3.045e-26 J.

Adding central interactions:3.045e-26 +5.54e-27=3.6e-26 J. Still not matching the options.

I think I'm stuck. The only option close to my initial calculation (5.5e-27) is option C (7.056e-27), but that's about 1.3 times higher. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all 12 charges as being at distance 2m from each other. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently. Wait, maybe the 13th charge is at the center and the 12 are arranged such that each is 2m from P, but their mutual distances are also 2m. That would require all 12 charges to be at the same point as P, which is impossible because then they'd be at zero distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only calculating the potential energy due to the 12 charges and the central charge, but each of the 12 is considered once. No, but the energy is for each pair.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a circle (not a sphere) of radius 2m. Then, the distance between adjacent charges could be 2m if they are equally spaced on a circle. But I'm not sure.

Wait, for a circle of radius r, the chord length between two adjacent points separated by angle Î¸ is 2r sin(Î¸/2). If the circle has 12 points, the angle between adjacent points is 30 degrees (360/12=30). So the chord length is 2r sin(15 degrees). For r=2m, that's 2*2 * sin(15)=4*(0.2588)=1.035m. So the distance between adjacent charges is about 1.035m.

But that's only for adjacent pairs. The problem is that in a circle, the distance between opposite points would be 4m (diameter). Hmm, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the average distance between two randomly chosen charges on the sphere is known. But I don't remember the exact formula.

Wait, for a sphere of radius R, the average distance between two points is (3 R)/2. So R=2m, average distance is 3 m.

So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(3 m).

So mutual U per pair is (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2)/3.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2=1.026e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:8.988e9 *1.026e-37=9.228e-28.

Divide by 3:3.076e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 66 mutual pairs:66 *3.076e-28=2.038e-26 J.

Now add the central interaction energy 5.537e-27 J.

Total U=2.038e-26 +5.537e-27=2.5917e-26 J.

Hmm, still not matching any options. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the average distance is larger. I thought it was 3R/2, but perhaps it's something else.

Wait, I found that the average distance between two random points on a sphere of radius R is (3R)/2. So for R=2m, average r=3 m.

So mutual U per pair is (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 )/3.

Which is 9.228e-28 /3=3.076e-28 per pair.

Total mutual U=66 *3.076e-28=2.038e-26.

Adding central U=5.537e-27.

Total U=2.592e-26 J, which is approximately 2.59e-26 J. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula for potential energy. Wait, potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges, bringing each charge from infinity to its position.

So, for the central charge, since it's fixed, we don't consider bringing it. For each of the 12 surrounding charges, the work done to bring it to 2m from P is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which is the same as before: 5.537e-27 J.

But again, not matching any option. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the central charge and not the mutual interactions, but that would leave us with 5.5e-27, which isn't an option. So I'm confused.

Wait, looking at option B:2.822e-26.

Which is exactly twice 1.411e-26. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and forgot to multiply by 2 somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, and their mutual distances are 4m (the diameter). So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/4.

Number of mutual pairs:66.

Each pair's U= (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /4.

(3.204e-19)^2=1.026e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:9.228e-28.

Divide by 4:2.307e-28 per pair.

66 *2.307e-28=1.523e-26.

Central interactions:5.537e-27.

Total U=1.523e-26 +5.537e-27=2.077e-26.

Which is 2.08e-26 J, but option B is 2.822e-26.

Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being ignored, and the problem is only considering the central charge interactions. So the answer would be 5.537e-27 J. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the 13 charges, including the central one, but that's already accounted for.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of all pairs, including the central charge and the 12, but not the mutual ones. So 12 pairs, each contributing 4.614e-28 J. 12*4.614e-28=5.537e-27 J.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, wait, Coulomb's law for potential energy between two charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r. But when considering the work done to bring charges from infinity to their positions, for a system of charges, each charge is brought in, and the potential energy is the sum of the work done against the existing charges.

So, for the first surrounding charge, you bring it from infinity to 2m away from the central charge. The work done is (k * (2e) * (2e))/(2m).

For the second surrounding charge, when you bring it in, the existing charge is the central charge plus the first surrounding charge. So the work done for the second charge is (k * (2e) * (2e +2e )) / (2m) )? No, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. The potential energy is calculated by considering all existing charges when a new charge is brought in. So for the first charge, you bring it in, and there's only the central charge present. So the work done is U1 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Then, for the second charge, when you bring it in, you have to do work against both the central charge and the first charge. So the work done is U2 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) + k*(2e)*(2e)/(r_12), where r_12 is the distance between the second and first charge.

But in reality, when you bring in the second charge, it's placed symmetrically, so the distance from the first charge is 2m (since all are on a sphere of radius 2m). So the distance between the first and second charge is also 2m. So the work done for the second charge is U2 = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) + (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, because bringing in the second charge, it feels the electric field from the central charge and the first charge.

So for each charge after the first, the work done includes the central charge and all previously placed charges.

But in this case, for 12 charges, each subsequent charge would require considering all previous 11 charges as well as the central charge.

But that's a more accurate calculation, but it's more complicated. So perhaps the problem is expecting this approach.

Let me try that.

The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the work done in bringing each charge from infinity to its position.

The first charge: only the central charge is present. So U1 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

The second charge: the central charge and the first charge. So U2 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) [from central] + k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) [from first charge].

Similarly, the third charge: U3 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) [central] + 2*(k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m)) [from first and second charges].

Wait, but if the charges are arranged symmetrically, each new charge would be at a distance of 2m from the central charge and also at 2m from all previously placed charges. But that's not possible unless all are at the same point, which can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between any two surrounding charges is 2m, which would require them to be on a regular dodecahedron or something. But without that, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions and treating each charge as if it's being brought in without considering the others. So each charge's potential energy is just due to the central charge, leading to 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which gives 5.537e-27 J.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the problem is considering a different approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, and the potential energy between each pair is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). But since each charge is identical, the potential energy is calculated for each pair once. So for 12 charges, there are 12 pairs (each charge with the central), but perhaps the formula is being applied as (number of charges)*(energy per charge). So 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =12 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 )/(2*2).

Wait, let me compute that.

(3.2e-19)^2=10.24e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:8.988e9 *10.24e-38=9.22e-28.

Divide by (2*2)=4:9.22e-28 /4=2.305e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12:2.305e-28 *12=2.766e-27 J.

Which is about 2.77e-27 J. Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 13 instead of 12? No, because the 13th is the central charge.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended approach is to calculate the energy between the central charge and each of the 12, leading to 5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the energy again.

Each charge contributes U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

k=8.988e9.

(2e)^2 =4eÂ²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*2.566e-38=1.026e-37.

So U per pair: (8.988e9 *1.026e-37)/(2*2) = (9.228e-28)/4=2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12:12 *2.307e-28=2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, but also, each is at 2m from all others. But as discussed earlier, this isn't possible unless all are at the same point, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let's try that.

k=9e9.

Each pair central: U = (9e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 )/(2*2).

(3.204e-19)^2=1.026e-37.

Multiply by 9e9:9e9 *1.026e-37=9.234e-28.

Divide by 4:9.234e-28/4=2.3085e-28 per pair.

12 pairs:12 *2.3085e-28=2.77e-27 J.

Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the potential energy between all 13 charges, but the 13th is fixed, so it's not included in the calculation. Wait, no, I think I accounted for that.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. But I can't figure out why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the central charge, leading to a higher value.

Wait, considering that the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each interacting with it. So that's 12 pairs.

Additionally, the 12 charges are all interacting with each other, 66 pairs.

But without knowing their mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that their mutual distances are 4m, the maximum possible (diametrically opposite), leading to mutual U being (k*(2e)^2)/4 per pair.

So mutual U=66 * (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /4.

Compute:

(3.204e-19)^2=1.026e-37.

Multiply by8.988e9:9.228e-28.

Divide by4:2.307e-28 per pair.

Multiply by66:1.523e-26 J.

Adding central U:5.537e-27.

Total U=1.523e-26 +5.537e-27=2.076e-26 J.

Which is 2.08e-26 J. Closest option is B)2.822e-26, but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2m, leading to mutual U=66 * (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /2.

Which is 66 * (9.228e-28 /2 )=66 *4.614e-28=3.045e-26 J.

Adding central U:3.045e-26 +5.537e-27=3.6e-26 J. Still no matching option.

I'm stuck. Given the options, and my calculations, the only option close to the central interactions is C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times the 5.5e-27 I calculated. So perhaps I missed a factor of âˆš3 or something in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, but their mutual distances are 2âˆš3 m. For example, arranged in a regular icosahedron. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy in a different way, such as considering the energy as (3/2) times the value I calculated. But I can't think why.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct approach elsewhere. Wait, in the end, I think the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see why.

Wait, let's compute 7.056e-27 J in terms of the calculation.

7.056e-27 /5.537e-27 â‰ˆ1.274.

So the ratio is about 1.274, which is roughly âˆš(1.625), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, and each has a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), and the total is 12 * that value.

Wait, but that's what I did, leading to 5.537e-27.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value exactly.

Compute exact value:

k=8.9875517879e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

Each charge is 2e, so 3.204353268e-19 C.

U per central pair: (8.9875517879e9 * (3.204353268e-19)^2 ) / (2 * 2).

Compute (3.204353268e-19)^2:

3.204353268e-19 *3.204353268e-19 = (3.204353268)^2 *1e-38.

3.204353268^2 = approx 10.265.

So 10.265e-38.

Multiply by 8.98755e9: 8.98755e9 *10.265e-38 =92.287e-29 =9.2287e-28.

Divide by (2*2)=4:9.2287e-28 /4=2.307175e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:12 *2.307175e-28=2.76861e-27 J.

So about 2.7686e-27 J. But the options don't have this.

Looking at the options again:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

So, 2.7686e-27 is closest to option C (7.056e-27) but about 2.55 times smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge, but the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are 4 meters, the maximum possible. So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(4).

Number of mutual pairs:66.

Total mutual U=66*(8.98755e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 )/4.

Compute:

(3.204e-19)^2=10.26e-38.

Multiply by8.98755e9:9.228e-28.

Divide by4:2.307e-28 per pair.

Multiply by66:1.523e-26.

Adding central U:2.768e-27.

Total U=1.523e-26 +2.768e-27=1.8e-26 J.

Which is 1.8e-26 J, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions, leading to 2.768e-27 J, which is approximately 2.77e-27. But the options don't have that either.

Given all this confusion, I think the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J. Perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the potential energy is for all 13 charges, but that doesn't make sense because one is fixed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm miscalculating the exponents. Let me check.

Wait, 3.204e-19 C squared is 1.026e-37 CÂ².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *1.026e-37 =9.228e-28.

Divide by 2:4.614e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12:5.537e-27 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Given that, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), and the total is 12 pairs, leading to 5.537e-27 J. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is approximately twice that value.

Wait, 5.537e-27 * 1.274=7.056e-27. So perhaps the problem is considering mutual interactions which add 1.274 times the central interactions.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't see why.

In conclusion, I think the intended answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a central charge fixed at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all distinct charge pairs, which includes interactions between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, as well as interactions among the 12 surrounding charges themselves.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Interactions with the Central Charge**:  
   Each of the 12 surrounding charges interacts with the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = \frac{k (2e)^2}{2m}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( 2m = 2 \, \text{m} \).  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (3.204 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2 \cdot 2}
   \]  
   \[
   (3.204 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.026 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.026 \times 10^{-37})}{4} = 2.307 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy due to interactions with the central charge is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total, central}} = 12 \cdot 2.307 \times 10^{-28} = 2.768 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Mutual Interactions Among the 12 Surrounding Charges**:  
   The 12 surrounding charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from the central charge, but their mutual distances are not explicitly given. The problem does not provide sufficient information to calculate the exact distances between the surrounding charges. However, the mutual potential energy depends on the distances between each pair of charges, which are variable and depend on their arrangement on the spherical shell of radius 2 meters. Without explicit information about the arrangement, the mutual potential energy cannot be precisely determined.

3. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A (\( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \))**: This value is significantly larger than the calculated energy for interactions with the central charge and is inconsistent with the problem setup.  
   - **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \))**: This value is also larger than the calculated energy for interactions with the central charge and does not match the expected contributions from mutual interactions.  
   - **Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \))**: This value is approximately 2.55 times the calculated energy for interactions with the central charge (\( 2.768 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)). It could account for additional contributions from mutual interactions, though the exact reasoning for this factor is unclear.  
   - **Option D (\( 122.330 \))**: This value is orders of magnitude larger than the expected energy and is inconsistent with the problem.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The most plausible answer, based on the calculations and the given options, is **Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \))**, as it is the closest to the calculated energy for interactions with the central charge and may include contributions from mutual interactions.

ANSWER: C
