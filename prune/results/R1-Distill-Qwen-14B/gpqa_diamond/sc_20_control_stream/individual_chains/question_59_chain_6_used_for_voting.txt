Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)₂]. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can react with each other. So I should probably figure out the total amounts of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture to see if there's an excess of either.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. So the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)₂ will be neutralization, producing water and a salt. Similarly, any excess acid or base will determine the pH of the solution.

Let me break this down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate moles of each component.

First, moles of CH3COOH (acetic acid). The formula is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Then, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Moles = 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is H+ and Cl- ions, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Ba(OH)₂: Each mole gives 2 moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻. So moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So OH- from this is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, that's a lot of OH- compared to H+ from HCl. But wait, let me think. The HCl will donate H+ and the Ba(OH)₂ will donate OH-.

But when you mix them, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So let's calculate the total H+ and OH- from all sources.

H+ sources:
- CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. But wait, since it's a weak acid, not all of it will dissociate, but wait, in the presence of a strong acid (HCl), which is a strong proton donor, the acetic acid's dissociation might be suppressed. Hmm, but wait, no. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will donate a lot of H+ ions. The presence of excess H+ would actually suppress the dissociation of the weak acid. So in this case, the CH3COOH might not contribute much H+ compared to the HCl. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about all the H+ from HCl and any that comes from the acetic acid, but considering that the HCl is such a strong acid, the acetic acid's H+ might be negligible compared to that.

Wait, maybe the better approach is to consider that after mixing, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize each other, and then see what's left.

So, let's calculate total H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)₂ is 0.18 moles.

So when H+ and OH- meet, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the amount of H+ after neutralization: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10. Wait, that can't be right because a negative would mean OH- excess. So, the OH- is in excess by 0.10 moles.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The H+ is 0.08 and OH- is 0.18. So the H+ will be completely neutralized by 0.08 moles of OH-. The remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So the excess OH- is 0.10 moles. Plus, I have to consider the acetic acid and any other sources of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but wait. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of excess OH-, it will react. Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So let's see: The acetic acid (CH3COOH) will react with OH-.

The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- can react with a mole of CH3COOH.

So, how much OH- is left after reacting with H+ from HCl? We found 0.10 moles of OH- excess after HCl and Ba(OH)₂.

So the OH- will then react with any available CH3COOH.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles, and the excess OH- is 0.10 moles. So the OH- can neutralize all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving (0.10 - 0.05) = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The OH- from Ba(OH)₂ is 0.18 moles. After reacting with H+ from HCl (0.08), we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. Then, that OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05), so all OH- is used (0.05) to neutralize CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-?

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 moles.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Neutralization of H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, so remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, the remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after that, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, the solution has excess OH- of 0.05 moles, and any remaining species from the reactions.

Wait, but after all that, what's left? Let's see.

So, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH would be 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's option A. But wait, let me double-check. Because I'm considering all the reactions, but perhaps I missed something.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions.

Total moles H+:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. But since in presence of strong acid, the CH3COOH may not dissociate much. Wait, but when we have excess OH-, the CH3COOH will react with OH-.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider all the H+ and OH- contributions, but that might get complicated.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Moles of H+:

From HCl: 0.08 mol.

From CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (but since it's a weak acid, maybe not all of it will donate H+; but in the presence of OH-, which is a strong base, perhaps all of it would donate H+ as it's neutralized).

Wait, no. The OH- will react with the CH3COOH. So CH3COOH (acid) and OH- (base) will react to form acetate and water.

So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the moles of CH3COOH is 0.05, and moles of OH- after HCl neutralization is 0.10.

So, the OH- (0.10) will first neutralize the H+ from HCl (0.08) and then react with CH3COOH (0.05).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other first. Then, any remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH.

So step by step:

1. H+ from HCl (0.08) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)₂ (0.18) → neutralizes 0.08 mol of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

2. Now, this remaining OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). Each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of CH3COOH, so 0.05 mol of OH- reacts, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

3. So, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left.

The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH is approximately 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but another possibility: let's think about whether the reaction between CH3COOH and Ba(OH)₂ is complete. Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid completely, right? Because OH- is a strong base and CH3COOH is a weak acid, so OH- will take all the H+ from CH3COOH.

So yes, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the pH should be around 12.62, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three components: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each component**:
   - CH₃COOH: \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} \), which dissociates into \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻**:
   - The \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) from HCl reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH**:
   - The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \), neutralizing all the CH₃COOH and leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

4. **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻**:
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - The concentration of OH⁻ is \( \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

5. **Calculate pOH and pH**:
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Wait, maybe the better approach is to consider that after mixing, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize each other, and then see what's left.

H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)₂ is 0.18 moles.

So when H+ and OH- meet, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the amount of H+ after neutralization: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10. Wait, that can't be right because a negative would mean OH- excess. So, the OH- is in excess by 0.10 moles.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The H+ is 0.08 and OH- is 0.18. So the H+ will be completely neutralized by 0.08 moles of OH-. The remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So the excess OH- is 0.10 moles. Plus, I have to consider the acetic acid and any other sources of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but wait. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of excess OH-, it will react. Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So let's see: The acetic acid (CH3COOH) will react with OH-.

The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- can react with a mole of CH3COOH.

So, how much OH- is left after reacting with H+ from HCl? We found 0.10 moles of OH- excess after HCl and Ba(OH)₂.

So the OH- will then react with any available CH3COOH.

The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles, and the excess OH- is 0.10 moles. So the OH- can neutralize all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving (0.10 - 0.05) = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The OH- from Ba(OH)₂ is 0.18 moles. After reacting with H+ from HCl (0.08), we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. Then, that OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05), so all OH- is used (0.05) to neutralize CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-?

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 moles.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Neutralization of H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, so remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, the remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after that, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, the solution has excess OH- of 0.05 moles, and any remaining species from the reactions.

Wait, but after all that, what's left? Let's see.

So, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH would be 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, the OH- (0.10) will first neutralize the H+ from HCl (0.08) and then react with CH3COOH (0.05).

3. So, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So yes, the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the pH should be around 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three components: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each component**:
   - CH₃COOH: \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} \), which dissociates into \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻**:
   - The \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) from HCl reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH**:
   - The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \), neutralizing all the CH₃COOH and leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

4. **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻**:
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - The concentration of OH⁻ is \( \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

5. **Calculate pOH and pH**:
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
