Okay, I need to figure out why there's no green signal in the mice when they were visualized under the confocal microscope. Let me go through the problem step by step.

So, the setup: a new ligand-receptor pair is being studied. Both are expressed in neural crest cells, and they want to see their developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. 

Looking at the stops: between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So these are stop signals that block expression unless the lox sites are recombined.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. They used primary astrocyte culture and saw signals proportional to actin loading. So the blot worked, and the proteins were expressed, probably.

They then made a mouse model homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background. Then crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is likely activating the construct in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they look under confocal for fluorescence. No green signal. Why?

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the issue here is about expression of the tagged proteins (eGFP and maybe mCherry) in the right cells. The Cre is SOX10-Cre, which affects neural crest derivatives. If it's paracrine, does that affect expression? Maybe not directly about expression but function. But the problem is about not seeing eGFP, which is the receptor-Egfp construct. So A might not be the reason for no signal.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is a reporter for proper processing. If it's stuck, it wouldn't fluoresce. But why would that happen? The construct includes the receptor correctly? If the eGFP is properly tagged, it should traffic correctly. Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette is still present. Wait, the stop is between receptor and eGFP, which is a lox2272 cassette. Cre is used to recombine lox sites. So if the Cre isn't active in the cells being looked at, the stop would remain, preventing eGFP expression.

But wait, the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so in those cells, Cre should be active. So in those cells, the lox2272 site would be recombined, removing the stop, and allowing eGFP to be expressed. But in other cells, without Cre, the stop remains.

In the confocal, they're probably looking for eGFP in the neural crest-derived cells. So why no green?

Option C: enhancer missing. The construct has the ligand under CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker element, allowing for lower expression than the ligand. But without an enhancer, the expression might be low. But the Western blot was positive, so maybe the expression is sufficient. But that's in culture. Maybe in the mouse, the enhancer isn't present, so the expression isn't happening. However, the construct design uses CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor, so maybe enhancers aren't the main issue here.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, and the lox sites are recombined, the stop is removed. But if the eGFP is not in frame, the receptor-eGFP fusion might not be made correctly. Wait, no: the construct says the receptor ORF is at 3', fused to eGFP. So if the stop is in between, and the lox is used to remove it, the receptor would be followed directly by eGFP. If the frame is correct, they should be in frame, meaning the eGFP is a C-terminal tag. So if the stop is removed, and the eGFP is in frame, then it should be expressed.

Wait, but sometimes, when you have a stop cassette, the ORF of the receptor is followed by the stop, and then the eGFP. So when Cre recombines the lox sites, it deletes the stop, allowing the receptor to be expressed. But the eGFP is only expressed if the stop is removed.

Wait, no: the setup is that the receptor ORF is under IRES, which is a internal ribosome entry site. So the ligand is under CBA promoter, then a stop, then the IRES, then the receptor. Or is it the other way? Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the first gene is ligand, under CBA promoter, then I think a stop, then IRES, then receptor. Or perhaps the IRES is before the receptor.

Wait, the problem says: the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. Between ligand ORF and mCherry: loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand has a stop after it, with lox sites. And the receptor has a stop before eGFP, with lox2272 sites.

So the vector is: CBA promoter → ligand ORF → loxP stop loxP → mCherry. Then, IRES → receptor ORF → lox2272 stop lox2272 → eGFP.

Wait, no, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the first cistron is the ligand under CBA promoter, then a stop, then IRES, then the receptor with eGFP. But the IRES allows for translation of the receptor without the need for a promoter (since the CBA promoter is upstream for the ligand).

When Cre is expressed, it will recombine the lox sites. So for the ligand, when Cre is active, the loxP sites will be cut, and the stop cassette removed. So the ligand and mCherry will be expressed together. Similarly, for the receptor, Cre will cut the lox2272 sites, removing the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor.

So in the mouse, which is homozygous for the construct, the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) should be active in neural crest cells, leading to the removal of both stop cassettes. So in those cells, both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the experiment, when they crossed the homozygous mice with SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show green signal. So why?

If the Cre isn't active, the stops would remain, so no eGFP. But SOX10-Cre should be active in the neural crest, which is where the receptor is expressed.

Wait, but in the problem, the Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes showed signals. So the construct works in culture. So expression is possible.

Another possibility: perhaps the loxP sites are the same, and Cre cannot recombine both cassettes. Wait, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272. Cre can recognize loxP and lox2272 sites if it's the same enzyme. Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different; lox2272 is a variant that is not cut by Cre unless paired with another lox2272. So if the Cre is active, it would only remove lox2272 sites if they are in a pair, or loxP sites if they are paired. Wait, no: Cre recognizes loxP sites, which are 34 base pair repeats. lox2272 is a different site, I think. So each lox site is unique in terms of Cre.

Wait, no. LoxP is the standard site. lox2272 is a mutated version that can only be cut by Cre when in a pair, but I might be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a different site that the same Cre can recognize. Let me think: Cre recombinase typically recognizes loxP sites, which are 34 bp with specific sequences. lox2272 is a variant that allows for directional recombination. But I'm not sure if Cre can recognize lox2272 sites on its own.

Wait, no. lox2272 is a site that requires Cre but is distinct from loxP. So, for a Cre to delete a lox2272 stop cassette, the Cre must recognize lox2272 sites. If the vector uses lox2272, and the Cre used is loxP-specific, then the lox2272 sites won't be cut. Wait, but in the problem, the Cre is from SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre mouse, which targets loxP sites. So, in that case, the lox2272 sites in the vector wouldn't be cut, meaning the stop before eGFP remains.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the ligand's stop is between it and mCherry, flanked by loxP. SOX10-Cre would cut loxP, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is between it and eGFP, flanked by lox2272. SOX10-Cre wouldn't cut lox2272. So the stop remains, eGFP is not expressed. Hence, no green signal.

That would explain why the green isn't showing up. Because only the loxP sites are cut, releasing the ligand's expression, but the lox2272 sites for the receptor-eGFP are not cut, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

So that would align with option D? Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the ORF after recombination.

Wait, but if the stop is still there, the eGFP won't be expressed at all. So the absence of green would be because the stop wasn't removed.

So the problem is that the Cre is only deleting the loxP sites, but not the lox2272 sites. So the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop remains. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

But why would they use different lox sites for the two cassettes? Oh, perhaps it's a dual cassette system where the same Cre can't cut both. But that's not clear in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector design is such that both cassettes use the same lox site. Wait, the ligand is flanked by loxP, the receptor by lox2272. So if the Cre in the mouse is only loxP-specific, it can't cut the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop, so no eGFP is expressed.

But wait, the problem states that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the ligand's ORF would be expressed when the Cre cuts the loxP stop. But the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand's stop. So without cutting the lox2272 sites, the IRES would drive the receptor's expression, but the stop before eGFP would prevent eGFP expression.

So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor-eGFP would not. So in the Western blot, they saw the ligand, I suppose, because the mCherry would be part of the ORF. But in the mouse, when they're looking for eGFP, it's not expressed because the stop is still there.

Thus, the reason for no green is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by the Cre, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let's check the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem if the stop was removed, but the reading frame is wrong. But if the stop remains, eGFP isn't expressed at all, which is more likely the issue.

Looking at the options, the correct reason should be that the stop in front of eGFP wasn't removed because the Cre couldn't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP is not expressed.

But the options don't have an option about different lox sites. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the construct uses CBA and IRES, so the enhancer shouldn't be the issue.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop was removed, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, making a nonfunctional or truncated protein. But if that were the case, the Western blot would detect the receptor but not eGFP. Since the blot in culture worked, perhaps this is not the issue.

Wait, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe in the Western blot they could see the receptor on its own, but in the mouse, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place.

But the question is, why no green in the mouse? Because eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the lox2272 sites are not being cut by the Cre, thus the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not an option. Alternatively, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the vector has both cassettes using the same lox site. Let me think again: the ligand ORF is at 5' with a stop in a loxP cassette. The receptor ORF is at 3', with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. The Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre (loxP-specific). So the loxP stops would be cut, but lox2272 stops wouldn't. So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor would not because the stop remains.

But the question states that the Western blot after transfection showed expression. So in culture, the vector must have been treated with Cre or something. But when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, perhaps the plasmid's Cre (if any) was present, but more likely, the plasmid was transfected without Cre, so the stops would remain unless Cre is present.

Wait, no, in the question, the plasmid is transfected into primary astrocytes. The construct has both stops, so without Cre, the stops are in place. So in the Western blot, how did they get any signals? Because when the plasmid is transfected, unless Cre is present, the stops are not removed.

Wait, perhaps in the plasmid, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, but the stop is in place. So the astrocytes might not express the ligand, but the Western blot showed a signal. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the stop is between the ligand and mCherry. So ligand is under CBA, then stop, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. So the Western blot would show ligand, but not mCherry.

But the problem says that they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps they were testing for the ligand and receptor presence.

Wait, perhaps in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is active, so the stops are cut. But the Receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, so why?

Alternative possibility: perhaps the IRES isn't working. But the IRES should allow for expression of the receptor.

Alternatively, the frame is off for eGFP. If the lox2272 stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But then, in the Western blot, the antibody against the receptor would detect the receptor, but eGFP might not show on the blot. However, the problem says that the Western blot worked, but the confocal didn't show eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent for another reason, but the question says no green signal, which suggests it wasn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells being examined. But SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the eGFP should be expressed there.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 stop cassette wasn't removed. But why?

Because the Cre used can't cut lox2272. So the stops remain, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't have that as a choice. Let me read the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, then the receptor is not fused to eGFP. So perhaps the construct is such that when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP.

But in that case, the Western blot might show the receptor, but the GFP wouldn't fluoresce. So perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because it's out of frame.

But without more information, I think the most likely reason is that the stop wasn't removed because the Cre couldn't cut the lox2272 sites. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't strong enough to allow the receptor to be expressed, but the Western blot worked. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. The ligand's ORF is at 5', with a stop, then IRES, then receptor ORF.

Wait, no: the problem says between ligand ORF and mCherry is the loxP stop. So the ligand is at 5', then stop, then mCherry. So the ligand is expressed, but without Cre, mCherry isn't. The receptor is at 3' with a stop before eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but if the ligand is under CBA, the stop is in place, so mCherry isn't expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for some expression. So without Cre, the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. 

But when the Cre is present (in the mouse), it cuts the loxP sites, allowing mCherry to be expressed with the ligand. It also cuts the lox2272 sites, allowing eGFP to be expressed with the receptor.

But in our case, the Cre is only loxP-specific. So it cuts the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but not the receptor's stop (lox2272), so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the mouse would express the ligand-mCherry fusion and the receptor without eGFP.

But in the confocal, they're looking for eGFP, which wouldn't be expressed. So why no eGFP? Because the stop remains.

So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains. But none of the options mention this.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the frame issue would prevent expression.

But why would the frame not be correct? The construct should include a stop in the cassette, and upon removal, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame.

Another possibility: if the IRES is after the stop, maybe the frame is wrong. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop was in the middle of the receptor's coding sequence, so removing it would cause a frame shift. No, because the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor is in frame, then the stop, then eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in the same frame.

Wait, no. The stop is in a cassette, which is after the receptor. So the receptor's ORF is intact. The stop is after the receptor, so the eGFP would be in frame.

So perhaps the stop is not the issue, but the lack of Cre cutting the lox2272 sites.

But again, none of the options mention this.

Alternative approach: let's think about each option and whether it explains the result.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. If they are paracrine, then the ligand would be secreted and act on neighboring cells. But the problem is about the expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor, not its function. So I don't think this explains the lack of eGFP.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is a fluorescent marker, and if it's stuck, it won't fluoresce. But why would it be stuck? Maybe incorrect glycosylation or something. But in the Western blot, the protein would still be present. The question says that the Western blot worked, so if the eGFP is not expressed, that's the issue, not its trafficking.

Option C: enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the promoters may not drive expression. But the CBA promoter is strong, and the IRES is used for the receptor. If the enhancer is missing, the proteins wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot worked, so I think this is not the case.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the lox2272 stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the Western blot would detect the receptor, but eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But why would the frame be wrong? The construct would have to have the eGFP in frame.

But perhaps the frame got messed up because the stop was in the middle. Or maybe the lox2272 stop was removed, but the reading frame shifted.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop was inside the receptor's coding sequence, but I think the problem says the stop is between the receptor and eGFP.

So the most likely answer, given the options, is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought. If the loxP sites are present only in the ligand's stop, and the lox2272 in the receptor's stop, and the Cre can only cut loxP sites, then the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't.

So in that case, the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options address this.

Since the options don't include this, I have to choose the best possible option. The only option pointing towards the eGFP not being expressed is option D. But if the frame is correct, and the eGFP is supposed to be expressed, but isn't, then the issue isn't with the frame but something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the lox2272 stop is before the receptor, not after. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is not expressed. No, the problem states the stop is between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, but if the stop wasn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

So the answer isn't in the options, but I have to pick the best fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at 5', then a stop, then IRES, then the receptor. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP stop. So the ligand is followed by a stop, which is followed by mCherry, but under the same promoter.

Wait, perhaps the vector is such that the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed, each under their own stops.

Wait, perhaps the ligand and mCherry are in one cassette, and the receptor and eGFP in another. So when Cre is present, both cassettes are cut, allowing both pairs to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10, which is in the neural crest. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed in neural crest cells, and the receptor and eGFP would be as well. But in the confocal, no green. So why? Because the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why? Because perhaps the stop wasn't cut. So if the stop for the receptor-eGFP is not cut, that's the issue.

But the options don't say anything about the lox sites. So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working. But in that case, the receptor wouldn't be expressed either, which might have shown on the Western blot.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible answer.

The correct answer is likely option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in the same reading frame, the protein won't be expressed correctly, so no eGFP. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is excluded because the lox2272 sites weren't cut, but the options don't cover this.

Wait, another thought: if the loxP stop is for the ligand, and lox2272 for the receptor, and the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the receptor's stop remains. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

But why would the receptor be expressed without eGFP? Because the stop is present. So in the Western blot, if they're looking for the receptor, it should be present. But the eGFP wouldn't be. So in the confocal, which looks for eGFP, there's no signal.

Thus, the problem is that the stop for eGFP isn't removed. But the options don't directly address this.

So the only option that might relate is D, which talks about the frame. But if the stop is still present, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the correct answer isn't any of the options, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge about the lox sites. The loxP and lox2272 are different, so the Cre can't cut both. Thus, only the ligand's stop is removed, but not the receptor's, leading to no eGFP.

But since no such option exists, I must have gone wrong. Maybe the question intended that both cassettes use the same lox sites, but they used different ones. So the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.

Wait, another angle. The vector is a bicistronic construct, and the IRES is after the ligand. So the ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES. The ligand's ORF is followed by a stop and mCherry, then IRES, then receptor ORF followed by stop and eGFP.

Wait, no: the problem says the ligand is first, then stop, mCherry. Then the receptor is after IRES, then stop, eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the ligand under CBA, then a stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then, after that, the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 stops are removed.

Wait, but the SOX10-Cre is only capable of cutting loxP sites, not lox2272. Therefore, the ligand's stop is cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the confocal doesn't show eGFP.

So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But again, none of the options mention that.

So, I'm forced to choose the best possible option. Since the construct includes a stop between receptor and eGFP, which isn't cut by the Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the explanation is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is incorrect because the enhancer isn't missing. Option D is about the frame, which might not be the issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, but IRES is supposed to drive expression, so that might be an option.

Wait, the options don't have anything about IRES not working.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ligand and receptor are not co-expressed because they're on separate cassettes, but that's not the issue.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The construct was introduced into mice homozygous for the vector, which were crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Despite this, no green fluorescence (eGFP) was observed in the offspring under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on neighboring cells. However, the issue here is about the expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. This does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized but would fail to traffic to the cell surface, leading to a lack of fluorescence. However, the Western blot showed expression of the proteins, indicating that the receptor and eGFP are being synthesized. This makes this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and an IRES element for the receptor, both of which are functional and sufficient for expression. The Western blot confirmed expression of the proteins in culture, ruling out the absence of an enhancer as the cause.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette were removed but the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed. However, the construct design indicates that the eGFP is directly fused to the receptor in frame. The lack of fluorescence is more likely due to the stop cassette remaining intact, preventing eGFP expression.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remains uncut because the SOX10-Cre used is loxP-specific and cannot recognize lox2272 sites. This prevents the removal of the stop cassette, leaving eGFP unexpressed. While none of the options explicitly address this issue, **Option D** is the closest fit, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to figure out why there's no green signal in the mice when they were visualized under the confocal microscope. Let me go through the problem step by step.

So, the setup: a new ligand-receptor pair is being studied. Both are expressed in neural crest cells, and they want to see their developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. 

Looking at the stops: between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So these are stop signals that block expression unless the lox sites are recombined.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. They used primary astrocyte culture and saw signals proportional to actin loading. So the blot worked, and the proteins were expressed, probably.

They then made a mouse model homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background. Then crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is likely activating the construct in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they look under confocal for fluorescence. No green signal. Why?

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the issue here is about expression of the tagged proteins (eGFP and maybe mCherry) in the right cells. The Cre is SOX10-Cre, which affects neural crest derivatives. If it's paracrine, does that affect expression? Maybe not directly about expression but function. But the problem is about not seeing eGFP, which is the receptor-Egfp construct. So A might not be the reason for no signal.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is a reporter for proper processing. If it's stuck, it wouldn't fluoresce. But why would that happen? The construct includes the receptor correctly? If the eGFP is properly tagged, it should traffic correctly. Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette is still present. Wait, the stop is between receptor and eGFP, which is a lox2272 cassette. Cre is used to recombine lox sites. So if the Cre isn't active in the cells being looked at, the stop would remain, preventing eGFP expression.

But wait, the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so in those cells, Cre should be active. So in those cells, the lox2272 site would be recombined, removing the stop, and allowing eGFP to be expressed. But in other cells, without Cre, the stop remains.

In the confocal, they're probably looking for eGFP in the neural crest-derived cells. So why no green?

Option C: enhancer missing. The construct has the ligand under CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker element, allowing for lower expression than the ligand. But without an enhancer, the expression might be low. But the Western blot was positive, so maybe the expression is sufficient. But that's in culture. Maybe in the mouse, the enhancer isn't present, so the expression isn't happening. However, the construct design uses CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor, so maybe enhancers aren't the main issue here.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, and the lox sites are recombined, the stop is removed. But if the eGFP is not in frame, the receptor-eGFP fusion might not be made correctly. Wait, no: the construct says the receptor ORF is at 3', fused to eGFP. So if the stop is in between, and the lox is used to remove it, the receptor would be followed directly by eGFP. If the frame is correct, they should be in frame, meaning the eGFP is a C-terminal tag. So if the stop is removed, and the eGFP is in frame, then it should be expressed.

Wait, but sometimes, when you have a stop cassette, the ORF of the receptor is followed by the stop, and then the eGFP. So when Cre recombines the lox sites, it deletes the stop, allowing the receptor to be expressed. But the eGFP is only expressed if the stop is removed.

Wait, no: the setup is that the receptor ORF is under IRES, which is a internal ribosome entry site. So the ligand is under CBA promoter, then a stop, then the IRES, then the receptor. Or is it the other way? Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the first gene is ligand, under CBA promoter, then I think a stop, then IRES, then receptor. Or perhaps the IRES is before the receptor.

Wait, the problem says: the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. Between ligand ORF and mCherry: loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand has a stop after it, with lox sites. And the receptor has a stop before eGFP, with lox2272 sites.

So the vector is: CBA promoter → ligand ORF → loxP stop loxP → mCherry. Then, IRES → receptor ORF → lox2272 stop lox2272 → eGFP.

Wait, no, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the first cistron is the ligand under CBA promoter, then a stop, then IRES, then the receptor with eGFP. But the IRES allows for translation of the receptor without the need for a promoter (since the CBA promoter is upstream for the ligand).

When Cre is expressed, it will recombine the lox sites. So for the ligand, when Cre is active, the loxP sites will be cut, and the stop cassette removed. So the ligand and mCherry will be expressed together. Similarly, for the receptor, Cre will cut the lox2272 sites, removing the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor.

So in the mouse, which is homozygous for the construct, the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) should be active in neural crest cells, leading to the removal of both stop cassettes. So in those cells, both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the experiment, when they crossed the homozygous mice with SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show green signal. So why?

If the Cre isn't active, the stops would remain, so no eGFP. But SOX10-Cre should be active in the neural crest, which is where the receptor is expressed.

Wait, but in the problem, the Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes showed signals. So the construct works in culture. So expression is possible.

Another possibility: perhaps the loxP sites are the same, and Cre cannot recombine both cassettes. Wait, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272. Cre can recognize loxP and lox2272 sites if it's the same enzyme. Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different; lox2272 is a variant that is not cut by Cre unless paired with another lox2272. So if the Cre is active, it would only remove lox2272 sites if they are in a pair, or loxP sites if they are paired. Wait, no: Cre recognizes loxP sites, which are 34 base pair repeats. lox2272 is a different site, I think. So each lox site is unique in terms of Cre.

Wait, no. LoxP is the standard site. lox2272 is a mutated version that can only be cut by Cre when in a pair, but I might be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a different site that the same Cre can recognize. Let me think: Cre recombinase typically recognizes loxP sites, which are 34 bp with specific sequences. lox2272 is a variant that allows for directional recombination. But I'm not sure if Cre can recognize lox2272 sites on its own.

Wait, no. lox2272 is a site that requires Cre but is distinct from loxP. So, for a Cre to delete a lox2272 stop cassette, the Cre must recognize lox2272 sites. If the vector uses lox2272, and the Cre used is loxP-specific, then the lox2272 sites won't be cut. Wait, but in the problem, the Cre is from SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre mouse, which targets loxP sites. So, in that case, the lox2272 sites in the vector wouldn't be cut, meaning the stop before eGFP remains.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the ligand's stop is between it and mCherry, flanked by loxP. SOX10-Cre would cut loxP, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is between it and eGFP, flanked by lox2272. SOX10-Cre wouldn't cut lox2272. So the stop remains, eGFP is not expressed. Hence, no green signal.

That would explain why the green isn't showing up. Because only the loxP sites are cut, releasing the ligand's expression, but the lox2272 sites for the receptor-eGFP are not cut, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

So that would align with option D? Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the ORF after recombination.

Wait, but if the stop is still there, the eGFP won't be expressed at all. So the absence of green would be because the stop wasn't removed.

So the problem is that the Cre is only deleting the loxP sites, but not the lox2272 sites. So the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop remains. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

But why would they use different lox sites for the two cassettes? Oh, perhaps it's a dual cassette system where the same Cre can't cut both. But that's not clear in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector design is such that both cassettes use the same lox site. Wait, the ligand is flanked by loxP, the receptor by lox2272. So if the Cre in the mouse is only loxP-specific, it can't cut the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop, so no eGFP is expressed.

But wait, the problem states that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the ligand's ORF would be expressed when the Cre cuts the loxP stop. But the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand's stop. So without cutting the lox2272 sites, the IRES would drive the receptor's expression, but the stop before eGFP would prevent eGFP expression.

So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor-eGFP would not. So in the Western blot, they saw the ligand, I suppose, because the mCherry would be part of the ORF. But in the mouse, when they're looking for eGFP, it's not expressed because the stop is still there.

Thus, the reason for no green is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by the Cre, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let's check the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem if the stop was removed, but the reading frame is wrong. But if the stop remains, eGFP isn't expressed at all, which is more likely the issue.

Looking at the options, the correct reason should be that the stop in front of eGFP wasn't removed because the Cre couldn't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP is not expressed.

But the options don't have an option about different lox sites. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the construct uses CBA and IRES, so the enhancer shouldn't be the issue.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop was removed, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, making a nonfunctional or truncated protein. But if that were the case, the Western blot would detect the receptor but not eGFP. Since the blot in culture worked, perhaps this is not the issue.

Wait, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe in the Western blot they could see the receptor on its own, but in the mouse, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place.

But the question is, why no green in the mouse? Because eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the lox2272 sites are not being cut by the Cre, thus the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not an option. Alternatively, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the vector has both cassettes using the same lox site. Let me think again: the ligand ORF is at 5' with a stop in a loxP cassette. The receptor ORF is at 3', with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. The Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre (loxP-specific). So the loxP stops would be cut, but lox2272 stops wouldn't. So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor would not because the stop remains.

But the question states that the Western blot after transfection showed expression. So in culture, the vector must have been treated with Cre or something. But when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, perhaps the plasmid's Cre (if any) was present, but more likely, the plasmid was transfected without Cre, so the stops would remain unless Cre is present.

Wait, no, in the question, the plasmid is transfected into primary astrocytes. The construct has both stops, so without Cre, the stops are in place. So in the Western blot, how did they get any signals? Because when the plasmid is transfected, unless Cre is present, the stops are not removed.

Wait, perhaps in the plasmid, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, but the stop is in place. So the astrocytes might not express the ligand, but the Western blot showed a signal. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the stop is between the ligand and mCherry. So ligand is under CBA, then stop, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. So the Western blot would show ligand, but not mCherry.

But the problem says that they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps they were testing for the ligand and receptor presence.

Wait, perhaps in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is active, so the stops are cut. But the Receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, so why?

Alternative possibility: perhaps the IRES isn't working. But the IRES should allow for expression of the receptor.

Alternatively, the frame is off for eGFP. If the lox2272 stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But then, in the Western blot, the antibody against the receptor would detect the receptor, but eGFP might not show on the blot. However, the problem says that the Western blot worked, but the confocal didn't show eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent for another reason, but the question says no green signal, which suggests it wasn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells being examined. But SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the eGFP should be expressed there.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 stop cassette wasn't removed. But why?

Because the Cre used can't cut lox2272. So the stops remain, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't have that as a choice. Let me read the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, then the receptor is not fused to eGFP. So perhaps the construct is such that when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP.

But in that case, the Western blot might show the receptor, but the GFP wouldn't fluoresce. So perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because it's out of frame.

But without more information, I think the most likely reason is that the stop wasn't removed because the Cre couldn't cut the lox2272 sites. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't strong enough to allow the receptor to be expressed, but the Western blot worked. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. The ligand's ORF is at 5', with a stop, then IRES, then receptor ORF.

Wait, no: the problem says between ligand ORF and mCherry is the loxP stop. So the ligand is at 5', then stop, then mCherry. So the ligand is expressed, but without Cre, mCherry isn't. The receptor is at 3' with a stop before eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but if the ligand is under CBA, the stop is in place, so mCherry isn't expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for some expression. So without Cre, the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. 

But when the Cre is present (in the mouse), it cuts the loxP sites, allowing mCherry to be expressed with the ligand. It also cuts the lox2272 sites, allowing eGFP to be expressed with the receptor.

But in our case, the Cre is only loxP-specific. So it cuts the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but not the receptor's stop (lox2272), so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the mouse would express the ligand-mCherry fusion and the receptor without eGFP.

But in the confocal, they're looking for eGFP, which wouldn't be expressed. So why no eGFP? Because the stop remains.

So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains. But none of the options mention this.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the frame issue would prevent expression.

But why would the frame not be correct? The construct should include a stop in the cassette, and upon removal, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame.

Another possibility: if the IRES is after the stop, maybe the frame is wrong. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop was in the middle of the receptor's coding sequence, so removing it would cause a frame shift. No, because the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor is in frame, then the stop, then eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in the same frame.

Wait, no. The stop is in a cassette, which is after the receptor. So the receptor's ORF is intact. The stop is after the receptor, so the eGFP would be in frame.

So perhaps the stop is not the issue, but the lack of Cre cutting the lox2272 sites.

But again, none of the options mention this.

Alternative approach: let's think about each option and whether it explains the result.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. If they are paracrine, then the ligand would be secreted and act on neighboring cells. But the problem is about the expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor, not its function. So I don't think this explains the lack of eGFP.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is a fluorescent marker, and if it's stuck, it won't fluoresce. But why would it be stuck? Maybe incorrect glycosylation or something. But in the Western blot, the protein would still be present. The question says that the Western blot worked, so if the eGFP is not expressed, that's the issue, not its trafficking.

Option C: enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the promoters may not drive expression. But the CBA promoter is strong, and the IRES is used for the receptor. If the enhancer is missing, the proteins wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot worked, so I think this is not the case.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the lox2272 stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the Western blot would detect the receptor, but eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But why would the frame be wrong? The construct would have to have the eGFP in frame.

But perhaps the frame got messed up because the stop was in the middle. Or maybe the lox2272 stop was removed, but the reading frame shifted.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop was inside the receptor's coding sequence, but I think the problem says the stop is between the receptor and eGFP.

So the most likely answer, given the options, is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought. If the loxP sites are present only in the ligand's stop, and the lox2272 in the receptor's stop, and the Cre can only cut loxP sites, then the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't.

So in that case, the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options address this.

Since the options don't include this, I have to choose the best possible option. The only option pointing towards the eGFP not being expressed is option D. But if the frame is correct, and the eGFP is supposed to be expressed, but isn't, then the issue isn't with the frame but something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the lox2272 stop is before the receptor, not after. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is not expressed. No, the problem states the stop is between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, but if the stop wasn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

So the answer isn't in the options, but I have to pick the best fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at 5', then a stop, then IRES, then the receptor. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP stop. So the ligand is followed by a stop, which is followed by mCherry, but under the same promoter.

Wait, perhaps the vector is such that the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed, each under their own stops.

Wait, perhaps the ligand and mCherry are in one cassette, and the receptor and eGFP in another. So when Cre is present, both cassettes are cut, allowing both pairs to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10, which is in the neural crest. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed in neural crest cells, and the receptor and eGFP would be as well. But in the confocal, no green. So why? Because the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why? Because perhaps the stop wasn't cut. So if the stop for the receptor-eGFP is not cut, that's the issue.

But the options don't say anything about the lox sites. So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working. But in that case, the receptor wouldn't be expressed either, which might have shown on the Western blot.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible answer.

The correct answer is likely option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in the same reading frame, the protein won't be expressed correctly, so no eGFP. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is excluded because the lox2272 sites weren't cut, but the options don't cover this.

Wait, another thought: if the loxP stop is for the ligand, and lox2272 for the receptor, and the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the receptor's stop remains. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

But why would the receptor be expressed without eGFP? Because the stop is present. So in the Western blot, if they're looking for the receptor, it should be present. But the eGFP wouldn't be. So in the confocal, which looks for eGFP, there's no signal.

Thus, the problem is that the stop for eGFP isn't removed. But the options don't directly address this.

So the only option that might relate is D, which talks about the frame. But if the stop is still present, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the correct answer isn't any of the options, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge about the lox sites. The loxP and lox2272 are different, so the Cre can't cut both. Thus, only the ligand's stop is removed, but not the receptor's, leading to no eGFP.

But since no such option exists, I must have gone wrong. Maybe the question intended that both cassettes use the same lox sites, but they used different ones. So the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.

Wait, another angle. The vector is a bicistronic construct, and the IRES is after the ligand. So the ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES. The ligand's ORF is followed by a stop and mCherry, then IRES, then receptor ORF followed by stop and eGFP.

Wait, no: the problem says the ligand is first, then stop, mCherry. Then the receptor is after IRES, then stop, eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the ligand under CBA, then a stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then, after that, the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 stops are removed.

Wait, but the SOX10-Cre is only capable of cutting loxP sites, not lox2272. Therefore, the ligand's stop is cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the confocal doesn't show eGFP.

So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But again, none of the options mention that.

So, I'm forced to choose the best possible option. Since the construct includes a stop between receptor and eGFP, which isn't cut by the Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the explanation is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is incorrect because the enhancer isn't missing. Option D is about the frame, which might not be the issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, but IRES is supposed to drive expression, so that might be an option.

Wait, the options don't have anything about IRES not working.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ligand and receptor are not co-expressed because they're on separate cassettes, but that's not the issue.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The construct was introduced into mice homozygous for the vector, which were crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Despite this, no green fluorescence (eGFP) was observed in the offspring under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on neighboring cells. However, the issue here is about the expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. This does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized but would fail to traffic to the cell surface, leading to a lack of fluorescence. However, the Western blot showed expression of the proteins, indicating that the receptor and eGFP are being synthesized. This makes this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and an IRES element for the receptor, both of which are functional and sufficient for expression. The Western blot confirmed expression of the proteins in culture, ruling out the absence of an enhancer as the cause.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette were removed but the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed. However, the construct design indicates that the eGFP is directly fused to the receptor in frame. The lack of fluorescence is more likely due to the stop cassette remaining intact, preventing eGFP expression.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remains uncut because the SOX10-Cre used is loxP-specific and cannot recognize lox2272 sites. This prevents the removal of the stop cassette, leaving eGFP unexpressed. While none of the options explicitly address this issue, **Option D** is the closest fit, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression.

ANSWER: D
