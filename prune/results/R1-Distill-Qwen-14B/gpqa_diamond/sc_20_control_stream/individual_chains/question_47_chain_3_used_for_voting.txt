Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a good starting point. Let me think about the possible structures that fit this formula.

The options are A) 3-ethoxybenzamide, B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, C) 4-aminophenyl propionate, and D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. I'll need to analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out which one it is.

Starting with the IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key clue. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The medium to strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 suggest the presence of either N-H or O-H groups. But since the molecular formula doesn't include O-H (like a hydroxyl group), I think it's more likely N-H. So maybe an amide or an amine. Wait, but looking at the options, all have either amide or ester groups. 

Wait, looking at the options again: let me see. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have a carboxylate ester (which is a carbonyl) and an amine group. The IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1720) and perhaps N-H stretches. But wait, the N-H in amines usually shows up broader around 3300-3500. So the IR matches that. 

Now, the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is likely a methyl group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. Then at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe an ethoxy group, but the broadness could indicate something else. Or perhaps it's an NH2 group? But wait, looking at the options, some have amines or amides which have NH groups.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is a quartet with 2H. A quartet suggests coupling to a CH2 that's split into 2. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something, like an ester. For example, in an ester group, the OCH2CH3 would typically have the CH2 closer to the oxygen around δ 4.1-4.3, and the CH3 as triplet at around δ 1.2-1.4. But here, the CH2 is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached as an OCH2CH2 something else? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So a para-substituted ring? Because in para substitution, you'd have two protons as a doublet each, if there's coupling between the adjacent protons. Alternatively, it could be a meta substitution, but that would have more complex splitting. Since it's two doublets, probably a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituents are at the para positions, but what's attached?

Let's go back to the options. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure would be OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, wait. Benzoate ester would be O-CO-OEt. So the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzene ring has an amino group (-NH2) at position 4 and a benzoate ester (O-CO-OEt) at another position. Wait, no, that can't be because benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So the ester would be O-CO-OEt attached to the ring. So the amino group is on the same ring but at the 4 position relative to the ester. That would make them para, so the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), but wait, benzene is a ring, so para would be positions 1 and 4. Wait, no, in benzene, para is 1 and 4 if numbering such that they are opposite. But in the structure, the substituents would be para, so their positions are across from each other.

So for NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets because of the substituents. Since the amino group is strong electron-withdrawing (due to resonance), the neighboring protons would be deshielded. But wait, the amino group is -NH2, which is not electron-withdrawing. Hmm, wait, in the benzoate, the ester group is O-CO-OEt, which is an electron-withdrawing group. The amino group is -NH2, which is a strong activating group but can have different effects based on its position.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions. Let's think about the coupling in the aromatic region. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, with each substituent in the para position relative to each other. So, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. Then the H's ortho to the substituents would be in positions 2 and 6 (relative to substituent 1) and positions 3 and 5 (relative to substituent 4). Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each substituent causing the adjacent H's to be deshielded. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group and an amino group. Let's consider the aromatic shifts. The amino group is a strong activating group (para/ortho director) with an NH2. The ester group is meta-directing and deactivating. So in the para positions, their substituents would affect the ring's protons.

But perhaps I should look at the NMR signals. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to two H. That suggests two sets of protons, each coupled to one neighboring proton. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, each in the para position, such that each substituent causes two equivalent protons that are each coupled to one neighbor. For example, in a para-substituted ring where substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the H's at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (if substituent is in 1), and the H's at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (if substituent is in 4). Then, each set would be a doublet because each H is next to only one other H in the ring. But wait, in a benzene ring, each H is adjacent to two others, so perhaps the splitting is more complex. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, the protons on the ring would be in two sets of two protons each. Each set would be equivalent and split into doublets due to coupling with the adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two pairs of equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet. Hmm, maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, but that's meta for each other. No, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the ring has H at 2,3,5,6. Wait, that's for a 1,4-dimethyl benzene. Then the H's at 2 and 6 would be ortho to substituent 1, and H's at 3 and 5 would be meta to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 2 and 6, but that doesn't seem to fit. Maybe the ring has an ester group in position 1 and an amino group in position 4, making the substituents para to each other. The aromatic protons would then be at positions 2,3,5,6. Those would split into two doublets. Wait, let's imagine substituents at 1 and 4. The H at 2 is adjacent to substituent 1 and has a neighbor at position 3. The H at position 3 is adjacent to substituent 4 and has a neighbor at position 2. So, perhaps the H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 are equivalent. Each set would be a doublet because each H is next to only one other H on the ring. So, each would be a doublet. Their chemical shifts would depend on the substituents.

The ester group is electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the protons adjacent to it, causing their shifts to be higher (downfield). The amino group is electron-donating, which would shield the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield. So, the H's next to the amino group would be around 7.0 ppm, and those next to the ester would be higher, like 8.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So that fits with D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Now looking at the NMR again. Let's go through each part.

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's the CH3 of the ethyl ester. The triplet indicates it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Hmm. Could this be the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester? Normally, the OCH2 in an ethyl ester would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but this is at 4.0 and as a broad singlet. Alternatively, perhaps another group. Another possibility is an NH group, but that would typically appear broader and maybe as a singlet. Wait, but the IR shows N-H stretches. So perhaps this is the NH2 group? But in D, the NH2 is on the benzene. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be expected to show up as a broad peak. But in D, the amino group is -NH2. So in the NMR, the NH2 protons would appear as a broad signal, possibly around 2-5 ppm, but it's a bit variable. But in the given NMR data, I don't see a signal in that region except the 4.0 ppm. Maybe that's the NH2? But wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Let me think. In the ethyl ester, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be the ethoxy group. The OCH2 would typically be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, integrating for 2H. But here, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet, integrating for 2H. Hmm, perhaps I've misassigned something.

Wait, the NMR peaks are 1.20 (t,3H), 4.0 (bs,2H), 4.5 (q,2H), 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let me think about the quartet at 4.5 ppm. What would that represent? A quartet with 2H suggests each H is split into four peaks. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group attached to something. So the structure would be -OCH2CH2-O-? No, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the ester's OCH2 is at 4.5, but that's a bit higher than usual. Or perhaps it's an ethylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: let's consider each option and their NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the ester group is O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene. The NH2 is a primary amine.

The NMR would show the ester's CH3 as triplet at around 1.2 ppm. The OCH2 in the ester would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5, so that's a bit higher than expected. Maybe there's some deshielding due to proximity to the amino group or other factors. Alternatively, perhaps that's not the OCH2. Wait, what about the NH2 group? The NH2 would show up as a broad singlet, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, but NH2 usually has two protons. So that could fit. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Wait, but in the case of a primary amine (-NH2), the protons are usually broad, but their chemical shift can vary. Sometimes they appear around 1-5 ppm. Also, the IR shows N-H stretches, which in the case of an amine would be around 3300-3500, which matches the given IR.

So for option D, the NMR would have:

- CH3 of ethyl ester at ~1.2 ppm, triplet.

- OCH2 of ethyl ester at ~4.1-4.3 ppm, quartet.

But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. So that's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is not the OCH2 but something else.

Wait, looking at the other options. Let's consider option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: benzene with OCH2CH3 at position 4 and a formamide group (HCONH-). So the formamide would have a carbonyl and an NH group.

The formamide's NH would show up as a broad signal, perhaps around 8 ppm. But in the IR, there's a strong band at 1720, which would be the formamide's carbonyl. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH3) and a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm (OCH2). Then, the formamide's NH would be a broad peak, maybe around 8 ppm? But in the given NMR, the only peaks are upfield. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

The aromatic region for B would be a para-substituted benzene (OCH2CH3 and formamide). The H's ortho to OCH2CH3 would be more shielded, perhaps upfield, and the H's ortho to formamide (which is an electron-withdrawing group) would be downfield. So perhaps the aromatic signals would be similar to D, but with a different substituent.

But let's think about the NMR data again. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). If the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0. So in B, we would have that. But the given quartet is at 4.5, so that doesn't fit.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be benzene with NH2 at para position and a propionate group. The propionate would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the ethyl group in the propionate would have a triplet for the CH3 (like 1.2 ppm, triplet), a quartet for the CH2 next to it (maybe around 4.0 ppm?), and a triplet for the middle CH2 (if any). Wait, the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the ester's OCH2CH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, and the adjacent CH2 as quartet around 4.0-4.5 ppm. So perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 in the propionate. But wait, the molecule is 4-aminophenyl propionate, so the ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. So the propionate's ethyl groups would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be at around 4.5 ppm as a quartet. That matches the data's 4.5 ppm quartet of 2H. Then the next CH2 would be a triplet around 1.6 ppm, but it's not in the data. Hmm.

Wait, but the given NMR has 1.20 ppm (t,3H), which matches the CH3 of the propionate. The quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Then, the OCH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the CH2 (maybe at 1.6 ppm) and a quartet for the central CH2, but I don't see a signal around 1.6 in the data. Hmm, but the data only lists a few signals. So perhaps that's possible. Also, the aromatic region would be similar to D, with two substituents (NH2 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) in the para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That could fit.

But wait, the IR: 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. Both D and C have ester carbonyls. So how to distinguish.

The amino group in D is a -NH2, which is a strong base. The formamide in B has an NH, which is also a strong N-H. But looking at the NMR, in C, the propionate's structure would give a triplet for the CH3, then a quartet for the adjacent CH2, and maybe a triplet for the next CH2, but in the given data, only the triplet at 1.20 and quartet at 4.5 are present. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with OCH2CH3 at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. So the IR would show the amide carbonyl (1720 cm-1), which matches. The N-H of the amide would be around 3300, which fits the IR. The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet around 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons would be more complex because the substituents are at positions 3 (ethoxy) and another position (the amide group is at position 1, perhaps, but in benzamide, the amide is at position 1). So the substituents are ethoxy at 3 and amide at 1. That would make the ring have substituents at 1 and 3, which are meta to each other. The aromatic protons would then be split into more signals because of the substituents' positions. So the NMR would have more than two signals in the aromatic region, which is not the case here. The given aromatic region only has two doublets, suggesting a para substitution, so A might not fit.

So, going back, options B and D have structures with substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons. So let's focus on these.

Looking at the NMR again. For option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester would have O-CO-OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, but what about the possibility that the quartet at 4.5 is the NH group? No, that doesn't make sense because NH protons are usually broad. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group.

Wait, another approach: let's count the integration.

The NMR has:

1.20 (t,3H) → 3H.

4.0 (bs,2H) → 2H.

4.5 (q,2H) → 2H.

7.0 (d, 2H) → 2H.

8.0 (d, 2H) → 2H.

Total: 3+2+2+2+2=11 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 11 H in the NMR, which matches the formula. So all protons are accounted for.

So the structure must have 11 protons. Let's check each option:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene (6 H), but substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH3 (which is 3 H in CH3 and 2 H in OCH2) and NH2 (2 H). Wait, but that would sum to 6 (benzene) - 2 (substituted protons) + substituent H: 3 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (NH2). So total H: (6-2) +3+2+2=4+7=11. Correct.

So the substituents are:

- O-CO-OCH2CH3: 3 H (CH3), 2 H (OCH2).

- NH2: 2 H.

So in the NMR, the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3.

The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, but that's at 4.5, which is a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps in D, the OCH2 is at 4.5, but that's not typical. Let me think about typical shifts. The ethoxy group's OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So 4.5 is a bit high. Hmm, maybe the amino group is causing some deshielding? Or maybe it's a different group.

In option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: benzene with OCH2CH3 and CONH2 groups in para positions. So the substituents are OCH2CH3 (3 H, CH3) and CONH2 (which has 2 H). The NMR would have:

- CH3 triplet at 1.2.

- OCH2 quartet around 4.0.

- CONH2 would have a singlet for the NH2, perhaps a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, but the data only shows 7.0 and 8.0 ppm in the aromatic region. So perhaps that's not matching.

But wait, the formamide's NH2 is at the end, so in formamide, the NH is a single H? No, formamide is RCONH2. So the NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps as a singlet. But in the given data, there's a 4.0 ppm broad singlet for 2H, which could match the NH2. But the formamide's NH2 is usually around 8 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The NMR would have:

- 1.20 (t,3H) for CH3.

- The OCH2 would be at 4.1 as a quartet, but the data shows it at 4.5. So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the quartet. Let's think. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. But why is it at 4.5? Maybe if it's part of the ester group, perhaps with some deshielding.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about the structure of D again: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is O-CO-OEt attached to benzene, and NH2 also attached to the benzene. So the ester part is O-CO-OEt.

So the ethyl group in the ester is OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1, and the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2. So in the data, we have 1.20 (t,3H) and 4.5 (q,2H). But the OCH2 is expected at 4.1, not 4.5. That's a problem.

Wait, what if the quartet is from the NH group? Wait, the NH2 in D is on the benzene. So the NH2 would be a broad singlet, possibly integrating for 2H. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that could fit. Then what about the quartet at 4.5? Maybe that's the OCH2. But why is it at 4.5?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from an adjacent CH2, like in a carbonyl group. Or perhaps there's an ethyl group elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: if the quartet is at 4.5, and it's 2H, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Like in a structure where the ethyl is part of a larger group.

Looking back, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is benzene with OCH2CH3 and CONH2 groups. The OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at 1.2 and a quartet around 4.0. The formamide's NH2 would be a broad peak. But in the data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be the NH2, but formamide's NH2 is usually more downfield. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the downfield aromatic peaks.

In option D, the ester is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the aromatic H ortho to it would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm. The amino group is electron-donating, so the H ortho to it would be more shielded, appearing at lower ppm. So in the NMR, the H's next to the ester would be around 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and the H's next to the amino group would be around 7.0 ppm (d, 2H). That matches the given data.

So, the structure of D would have the ester and amino groups para to each other. The ester's OCH2 would be a quartet, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher than usual. Could that be an issue?

Alternatively, perhaps in the NMR, the OCH2 is split into a quartet because of coupling with the adjacent CH2. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 is next to a CH3, which is a triplet. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH3. So that matches with the quartet at 4.5. But why is it at 4.5 instead of 4.1?

Wait, maybe the quartet is not the OCH2 but another group. For instance, perhaps the ethyl group attached to the amino group? No, amino groups are usually NH2, not ethyl.

Wait, another thought: D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene ring with O-CO-OEt and NH2 groups in para positions. The ester's OCH2 would be a quartet, and the NH2's protons would be a broad singlet. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, while the OCH2 is usually around 4.1. So perhaps this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the NH group? But NH is usually broad and not a quartet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, considering that the given NMR doesn't have a peak around 5 ppm, which is where the OCH2 in an ethyl ester usually is, but it's at 4.5. Maybe that's acceptable within the variation of chemical shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group. Let's think about the other options. Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would have a propionate ester, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a quartet at around 4.5 ppm, which matches the data. The CH3 of the propionate would be a triplet at 1.2. That fits. The NH2 would be a broad singlet, perhaps around 4.0 ppm. So the 4.0 could be the NH2, and the 4.5 is the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

So let's put it together for option C:

- CH3 (propionate) at 1.2, triplet.

- CH2 (propionate) at 4.5, quartet.

- NH2 (broad singlet at 4.0).

The aromatic protons would be two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0, which matches. So the NMR data would fit C as well.

But then, the IR: the ester carbonyl is at 1720, which fits. The N-H in the amide would be in the IR, but option C is a propionate, which is an ester, not an amide. So the IR would have the ester carbonyl, and the NH in the amine. The amino group in C is -NH2, which would show N-H stretches in the IR around 3300-3500, which matches.

So now I'm confused because both D and C seem to fit.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So:

C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2 → 10/2 =5 degrees. Which could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds) + one double bond (ester or amide), so that fits.

For option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

The ester group contributes one double bond (C=O), and the benzene ring has three. So total degrees of unsaturation are 4 (from benzene) +1 (ester) =5. Correct.

Similarly, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) =4. Wait, that's only 4. Wait, no, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation for D.

D is C9H11NO2:

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So D has 5, which is correct.

So both C and D have the correct degrees.

But the IR in the question shows strong N-H stretches. Both D and C have NH2 groups. So the IR doesn't help to distinguish between them.

Let me look again at the NMR data. The signals are:

1.20 (t,3H) → CH3.

4.0 (bs,2H) → perhaps NH2.

4.5 (q,2H) → CH2.

7.0 and 8.0 ppm (each d, 2H) → aromatic.

So for option C, the propionate would have a CH3 (t, 1.2), a CH2 (q, 4.5), and a CH2 (maybe around 2.3 as triplet, but not present in data). The NH2 would be at 4.0 as a broad singlet. So that fits.

But for option D, the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ester. If that's the case, then the NH2 would be a broad singlet. But the 4.0 in the data is a broad singlet for 2H, which would fit the NH2. So both D and C could fit, but the quartet in the data is 2H at 4.5. So for D, the OCH2 is 2H, quartet. For C, the CH2 is 2H, quartet.

Wait, so both D and C could have a quartet for 2H at 4.5. Hmm, but let me think about the number of peaks. In D, the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH3 in the ethyl group. So that's correct.

But in C, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a quartet because it's adjacent to another CH2. Wait, no, in propionate, the structure is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. The CH2 attached to the carbonyl (let's call it CH2a) is adjacent to CH2b (which is adjacent to CH3). So CH2a would be split by CH2b, which is a triplet, so CH2a would be a quartet. That aligns with the data's quartet at 4.5.

So both D and C have quartets at 4.5 ppm.

But how do I decide between D and C?

Another point: the NH2 in D is a primary amine attached to the benzene. The NH2 in C is also a primary amine attached to the benzene. So their NMR would be similar.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the splitting in the aromatic region. In D, the substituents are the ester (COOEt) and the NH2. The ester group is a strong deactivating group, while the NH2 is activating.

In the aromatic region, the H's next to the ester would be deshielded and appear downfield (around 8.0 ppm), and the H's next to the NH2 would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm), as I thought before.

In option C, the substituents are the NH2 and the ester group (propionate). So the same logic applies: H's next to the ester would be downfield (8.0 ppm), and next to NH2 would be upfield (7.0 ppm).

So that doesn't help.

Wait, another thing: the molecular formula. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Its formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count:

Benzoate ester (C7H5O2) + ethyl group (C2H5) + NH2 (adding one N and one H). Wait, no, the formula would be C8H8O2 (benzoate) plus C2H5 and NH2. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester is C9H10O2. Wait, wait, no. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would be C9H10O2 (since it's C7H5O2 + C2H5O). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the formula.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O-CO-OEt attached to benzene with NH2 at para. So the formula is C7H5O2 (benzoate) minus the H from the COOH (since it's an ester), plus C2H5 (ethyl group) plus NH2 (which adds N and H). So:

Benzoate (C7H5O2) → C7H5O2.

Ester: replace the H from COOH with OEt (C2H5O). So benzoate ester is C9H10O2.

Now adding the NH2 group: it's attached to the benzene, so adds N and H: C9H10O2 plus NH2 → C9H11NO2. Which matches the molecular formula. So D is correct.

Wait, no, wait. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ester would be C7H5O2 (from losing one H to form the ester). Then, adding an ethyl group (C2H5O) would make it C9H10O2. Plus the NH2 adds one N and one H (since it's replacing a H on the benzene). So total is C9H11NO2. Which matches the formula.

Similarly, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionic acid is C3H6O2. As an ester, it's C3H5O2. So the phenyl propionate would be C7H5O2 (benzene) + C3H5O2 (propionate) → C10H10O2? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. The structure is benzene (C6H5) connected to O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. That's C6 + 3 (from propionate) + 2 (O and CO) → C11? Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

The formula for phenyl propionate is C6H5-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So C6 + 3 (propionate) + 2 (O and CO) → Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate the molecular formula:

Phenyl group: C6H5.

Propionate group: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons, plus O and CO. So the propionate is C3H5O2.

So the total formula is C6 (from benzene) + C3 (from propionate) = C9. H: benzene has 5 H (since substituents are O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2). Wait, no, the benzene in 4-aminophenyl propionate has substituents at positions 4 and 1 (assuming propionate is at position 1). So the benzene is C6H4 (since two H are substituted). Then the propionate is C3H5O2, and the NH2 is adding one N and one H. So the total formula is C6 + C3 = C9. H: (4 from benzene) +5 (from propionate) +1 (from NH2) =10? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 10 H vs 11. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count again.

4-aminophenyl propionate: structure is benzene ring with NH2 at position 4 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 at position 1. The benzene has 6 C, 5 H (since two substituents). The propionate group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 C, 6 H (CH2CH2CH3 has 3 CH2 groups, so 6 H). Wait, no. The CH2CH2CH3 is CH2CH2CH3 → that's CH2-CH2-CH3. So each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H. So that's 2+2+3=7 H. Plus the O and CO which don't add H. So the propionate group contributes 7 H.

The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). The NH2 contributes 2 H. So total H: 4 +7 + 2 =13? But the formula is C9H11NO2. That can't be. So perhaps I'm wrong in this assessment.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H (the CH2CH2CH3 group). So adding up:

Benzene: 5 H (assuming two substituents) → but wait, the benzene is C6H5 with two substituents, so 4 H. Propionate: 7 H. NH2: 2 H. So 4 +7 +2=13 H, but the formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that's a problem. Therefore, option C can't be correct because the molecular formula would have 13 H instead of 11.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, which has 5 H (since one substituent is the propionate, another is NH2). Wait, no. The molecular formula of 4-aminophenyl propionate should be:

Phenyl group (C6H5) → 5 H.

Propionate group: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → which has 7 H (the CH2 groups).

NH2 → 2 H.

But wait, the benzene has 5 H when it's attached to two substituents. So 5 +7 +2 =14 H → no, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe the propionate is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's a different group. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, making it a propiono ester.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the formula given is C9H11NO2. Each option must fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2. Ethyl group is C2H5. So C7 + C2 = C9. O2 from benzoate. Then, the NH2 adds one N and one H. So the formula becomes C9H6O2 plus NH2 → C9H7NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOEt → which is C9H10O2.

So, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C6H4(NH2)COOEt. So the formula is C9H11NO2. That matches. So D's formula is correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is C6H4(NH2)CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

The formula would be:

C6 (benzene) + 1 (CO) + 3 (propionate CH2CH2CH3) + N → C10H? Let me count:

Each CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (CH2 has 2 H each, CH3 has 3 H).

The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3).

The NH2 has 2 H.

So total H:4 (benzene) +7 (propionate) +2 (NH2)=13 H. But formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Therefore, option C can't be correct. So that leaves option D as the correct answer.

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a good starting point. Let me think about the possible structures that fit this formula.

The options are A) 3-ethoxybenzamide, B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, C) 4-aminophenyl propionate, and D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. I'll need to analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out which one it is.

Starting with the IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key clue. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The medium to strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 suggest the presence of either N-H or O-H groups. But since the molecular formula doesn't include O-H (like a hydroxyl group), I think it's more likely N-H. So maybe an amide or an amine. Wait, but looking at the options, all have either amide or ester groups. 

Wait, looking at the options again: let me see. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have a carboxylate ester (which is a carbonyl) and an amine group. The IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1720) and perhaps N-H stretches. But wait, the N-H in amines usually shows up broader around 3300-3500. So the IR matches that. 

Now, the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is likely a methyl group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. Then at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe an ethoxy group, but the broadness could indicate something else. Or perhaps it's an NH2 group? But wait, looking at the options, some have amines or amides which have NH groups.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is a quartet with 2H. A quartet suggests coupling to a CH2 that's split into 2. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something, like an ester. For example, in an ester group, the OCH2CH3 would typically have the CH2 closer to the oxygen around δ 4.1-4.3, and the CH3 as triplet at around δ 1.2-1.4. But here, the CH2 is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached as an OCH2CH2 something else? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So a para-substituted ring? Because in para substitution, you'd have two protons as a doublet each, if there's coupling between the adjacent protons. Alternatively, it could be a meta substitution, but that would have more complex splitting. Since it's two doublets, probably a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituents are at the para positions, but what's attached?

Let's go back to the options. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure would be OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, wait. Benzoate ester would be O-CO-OEt. So the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzene ring has an amino group (-NH2) at position 4 and a benzoate ester (O-CO-OEt) at another position. Wait, no, that can't be because benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So the ester would be O-CO-OEt attached to the ring. So the amino group is on the same ring but at the 4 position relative to the ester. That would make them para, so the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), but wait, benzene is a ring, so para would be positions 1 and 4. Wait, no, in benzene, para is 1 and 4 if numbering such that they are opposite. But in the structure, the substituents would be para, so their positions are across from each other.

So for NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets because of the substituents. Since the amino group is strong electron-withdrawing (due to resonance), the neighboring protons would be deshielded. But wait, the amino group is -NH2, which is not electron-withdrawing. Hmm, wait, in the benzoate, the ester group is O-CO-OEt, which is an electron-withdrawing group. The amino group is -NH2, which is a strong activating group but can have different effects based on its position.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions. Let's think about the coupling in the aromatic region. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, with each substituent in the para position relative to each other. So, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. Then the H's ortho to the substituents would be in positions 2 and 6 (relative to substituent 1) and positions 3 and 5 (relative to substituent 4). Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each substituent causing the adjacent H's to be deshielded. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group and an amino group. Let's consider the aromatic shifts. The amino group is a strong activating group (para/ortho director) with an NH2. The ester group is meta-directing and deactivating. So in the para positions, their substituents would affect the ring's protons.

But perhaps I should look at the NMR signals. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to two H. That suggests two sets of protons, each coupled to one neighboring proton. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, each in the para position, such that each substituent causes two equivalent protons that are each coupled to one neighbor. For example, in a para-substituted ring where substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the H's at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (if substituent is in 1), and the H's at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (if substituent is in 4). Then, each set would be a doublet because each H is next to only one other H in the ring. But wait, in a benzene ring, each H is adjacent to two others, so perhaps the splitting is more complex. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, the protons on the ring would be in two sets of two protons each. Each set would be equivalent and split into doublets due to coupling with the adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two pairs of equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet. Hmm, maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, but that's meta for each other. No, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the ring has H at 2,3,5,6. Wait, that's for a 1,4-dimethyl benzene. Then the H's at 2 and 6 would be ortho to substituent 1, and H's at 3 and 5 would be meta to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 2 and 6, but that doesn't seem to fit. Maybe the ring has an ester group in position 1 and an amino group in position 4, making the substituents para to each other. The aromatic protons would then be at positions 2,3,5,6. Those would split into two doublets. Wait, let's imagine substituents at 1 and 4. The H at 2 is adjacent to substituent 1 and has a neighbor at position 3. The H at position 3 is adjacent to substituent 4 and has a neighbor at position 2. So, perhaps the H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 are equivalent. Each set would be a doublet because each H is next to only one other H on the ring. So, each would be a doublet. Their chemical shifts would depend on the substituents.

The ester group is electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the protons adjacent to it, causing their shifts to be higher (downfield). The amino group is electron-donating, which would shield the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield. So, the H's next to the amino group would be around 7.0 ppm, and those next to the ester would be higher, like 8.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So that fits with D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Now looking at the NMR again. Let's go through each part.

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's the CH3 of the ethyl ester. The triplet indicates it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Hmm. Could this be the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester? Normally, the OCH2 in an ethyl ester would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but this is at 4.0 and as a broad singlet. Alternatively, perhaps another group. Another possibility is an NH group, but that would typically appear broader and maybe as a singlet. Wait, but the IR shows N-H stretches. So perhaps this is the NH2 group? But in D, the NH2 is on the benzene. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be expected to show up as a broad peak. But in D, the amino group is -NH2. So in the NMR, the NH2 protons would appear as a broad signal, possibly around 2-5 ppm, but it's a bit variable. But in the given NMR data, I don't see a signal in that region except the 4.0 ppm. Maybe that's the NH2? But wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Let me think. In the ethyl ester, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be the ethoxy group. The OCH2 would typically be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, integrating for 2H. But here, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet, integrating for 2H. Hmm, perhaps I've misassigned something.

Wait, the NMR peaks are 1.20 (t,3H), 4.0 (bs,2H), 4.5 (q,2H), 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let me think about the quartet at 4.5 ppm. What would that represent? A quartet with 2H suggests each H is split into four peaks. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group attached to something. So the structure would be -OCH2CH2-O-? No, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the ester's OCH2 is at 4.5, but that's a bit higher than usual. Or perhaps it's an ethylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: let's consider each option and their NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the ester group is O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene. The NH2 is a primary amine.

The NMR would show the ester's CH3 as triplet at around 1.2 ppm. The OCH2 in the ester would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5, so that's a bit higher than expected. Maybe there's some deshielding due to proximity to the amino group or other factors. Alternatively, perhaps that's not the OCH2. Wait, what about the NH2 group? The NH2 would show up as a broad singlet, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, but NH2 usually has two protons. So that could fit. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Wait, but in the case of a primary amine (-NH2), the protons are usually broad, but their chemical shift can vary. Sometimes they appear around 1-5 ppm. Also, the IR shows N-H stretches, which in the case of an amine would be around 3300-3500, which matches the given IR.

So for option D, the NMR would have:

- CH3 of ethyl ester at ~1.2 ppm, triplet.

- OCH2 of ethyl ester at ~4.1-4.3 ppm, quartet.

But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. So that's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is not the OCH2 but something else.

Wait, looking at the other options. Let's consider option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: benzene with OCH2CH3 at position 4 and a formamide group (HCONH-). So the formamide would have a carbonyl and an NH group.

The formamide's NH would show up as a broad signal, perhaps around 8 ppm. But in the IR, there's a strong band at 1720, which would be the formamide's carbonyl. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH3) and a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm (OCH2). Then, the formamide's NH would be a broad peak, maybe around 8 ppm? But in the given NMR, the only peaks are upfield. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

The aromatic region for B would be a para-substituted benzene (OCH2CH3 and formamide). The H's ortho to OCH2CH3 would be more shielded, perhaps upfield, and the H's ortho to formamide (which is an electron-withdrawing group) would be downfield. So perhaps the aromatic signals would be similar to D, but with a different substituent.

But let's think about the NMR data again. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). If the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0. So in B, we would have that. But the given quartet is at 4.5, so that doesn't fit.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be benzene with NH2 at para position and a propionate group. The propionate would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the ethyl group in the propionate would have a triplet for the CH3 (like 1.2 ppm, triplet), a quartet for the CH2 next to it (maybe around 4.0 ppm?), and a triplet for the middle CH2 (if any). Wait, the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the ester's OCH2CH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, and the adjacent CH2 as quartet around 4.0-4.5 ppm. So perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 in the propionate. But wait, the molecule is 4-aminophenyl propionate, so the ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. So the propionate's ethyl groups would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be at around 4.5 ppm as a quartet. That matches the data's 4.5 ppm quartet of 2H. Then the next CH2 would be a triplet around 1.6 ppm, but it's not in the data. Hmm.

Wait, but the given NMR has 1.20 ppm (t,3H), which matches the CH3 of the propionate. The quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Then, the OCH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the CH2 (maybe at 1.6 ppm) and a quartet for the central CH2, but I don't see a signal around 1.6 in the data. Hmm, but the data only lists a few signals. So perhaps that's possible. Also, the aromatic region would be similar to D, with two substituents (NH2 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) in the para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That could fit.

But wait, the IR: 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. Both D and C have ester carbonyls. So how to distinguish.

The amino group in D is a -NH2, which is a strong base. The formamide in B has an NH, which is also a strong N-H. But looking at the NMR, in C, the propionate's structure would give a triplet for the CH3, then a quartet for the adjacent CH2, and maybe a triplet for the next CH2, but in the given data, only the triplet at 1.20 and quartet at 4.5 are present. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with OCH2CH3 at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. So the IR would show the amide carbonyl (1720 cm-1), which matches. The N-H of the amide would be around 3300, which fits the IR. The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet around 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons would be more complex because the substituents are at positions 3 (ethoxy) and another position (the amide group is at position 1, perhaps, but in benzamide, the amide is at position 1). So the substituents are ethoxy at 3 and amide at 1. That would make the ring have substituents at 1 and 3, which are meta to each other. The aromatic protons would then be split into more signals because of the substituents' positions. So the NMR would have more than two signals in the aromatic region, which is not the case here. The given aromatic region only has two doublets, suggesting a para substitution, so A might not fit.

So, going back, options B and D have structures with substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons. So let's focus on these.

Looking at the NMR again. For option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester would have O-CO-OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, but what about the possibility that the quartet at 4.5 is the NH group? No, that doesn't make sense because NH protons are usually broad. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group.

Wait, another approach: let's count the integration.

The NMR has:

1.20 (t,3H) → 3H.

4.0 (bs,2H) → 2H.

4.5 (q,2H) → 2H.

7.0 (d, 2H) → 2H.

8.0 (d, 2H) → 2H.

Total: 3+2+2+2+2=11 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 11 H in the NMR, which matches the formula. So all protons are accounted for.

So the structure must have 11 protons. Let's check each option:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene (6 H), but substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH3 (which is 3 H in CH3 and 2 H in OCH2) and NH2 (2 H). Wait, but that would sum to 6 (benzene) - 2 (substituted protons) + substituent H: 3 (CH3) + 2 (OCH2) + 2 (NH2). So total H: (6-2) +3+2+2=4+7=11. Correct.

So the substituents are:

- O-CO-OCH2CH3: 3 H (CH3), 2 H (OCH2).

- NH2: 2 H.

So in the NMR, the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3.

The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, but that's at 4.5, which is a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps in D, the OCH2 is at 4.5, but that's not typical. Let me think about typical shifts. The ethoxy group's OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So 4.5 is a bit high. Hmm, maybe the amino group is causing some deshielding? Or maybe it's a different group.

In option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: benzene with OCH2CH3 and CONH2 groups in para positions. So the substituents are OCH2CH3 (3 H, CH3) and CONH2 (which has 2 H). The NMR would have:

- CH3 triplet at 1.2.

- OCH2 quartet around 4.0.

- CONH2 would have a singlet for the NH2, perhaps a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, but the data only shows 7.0 and 8.0 ppm in the aromatic region. So perhaps that's not matching.

But wait, the formamide's NH2 is at the end, so in formamide, the NH is a single H? No, formamide is RCONH2. So the NH2 would be a broad peak, perhaps as a singlet. But in the given data, there's a 4.0 ppm broad singlet for 2H, which could match the NH2. But the formamide's NH2 is usually around 8 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The NMR would have:

- 1.20 (t,3H) for CH3.

- The OCH2 would be at 4.1 as a quartet, but the data shows it at 4.5. So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the quartet. Let's think. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. But why is it at 4.5? Maybe if it's part of the ester group, perhaps with some deshielding.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about the structure of D again: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is O-CO-OEt attached to benzene, and NH2 also attached to the benzene. So the ester part is O-CO-OEt.

So the ethyl group in the ester is OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1, and the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2. So in the data, we have 1.20 (t,3H) and 4.5 (q,2H). But the OCH2 is expected at 4.1, not 4.5. That's a problem.

Wait, what if the quartet is from the NH group? Wait, the NH2 in D is on the benzene. So the NH2 would be a broad singlet, possibly integrating for 2H. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that could fit. Then what about the quartet at 4.5? Maybe that's the OCH2. But why is it at 4.5?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from an adjacent CH2, like in a carbonyl group. Or perhaps there's an ethyl group elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: if the quartet is at 4.5, and it's 2H, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Like in a structure where the ethyl is part of a larger group.

Looking back, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is benzene with OCH2CH3 and CONH2 groups. The OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at 1.2 and a quartet around 4.0. The formamide's NH2 would be a broad peak. But in the data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be the NH2, but formamide's NH2 is usually more downfield. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the downfield aromatic peaks.

In option D, the ester is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the aromatic H ortho to it would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm. The amino group is electron-donating, so the H ortho to it would be more shielded, appearing at lower ppm. So in the NMR, the H's next to the ester would be around 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and the H's next to the amino group would be around 7.0 ppm (d, 2H). That matches the given data.

So, the structure of D would have the ester and amino groups para to each other. The ester's OCH2 would be a quartet, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher than usual. Could that be an issue?

Alternatively, perhaps in the NMR, the OCH2 is split into a quartet because of coupling with the adjacent CH2. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 is next to a CH3, which is a triplet. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH3. So that matches with the quartet at 4.5. But why is it at 4.5 instead of 4.1?

Wait, maybe the quartet is not the OCH2 but another group. For instance, perhaps the ethyl group attached to the amino group? No, amino groups are usually NH2, not ethyl.

Wait, another thought: D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene ring with O-CO-OEt and NH2 groups in para positions. The ester's OCH2 would be a quartet, and the NH2's protons would be a broad singlet. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, while the OCH2 is usually around 4.1. So perhaps this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the NH group? But NH is usually broad and not a quartet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, considering that the given NMR doesn't have a peak around 5 ppm, which is where the OCH2 in an ethyl ester usually is, but it's at 4.5. Maybe that's acceptable within the variation of chemical shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group. Let's think about the other options. Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would have a propionate ester, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a quartet at around 4.5 ppm, which matches the data. The CH3 of the propionate would be a triplet at 1.2. That fits. The NH2 would be a broad singlet, perhaps around 4.0 ppm. So the 4.0 could be the NH2, and the 4.5 is the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

So let's put it together for option C:

- CH3 (propionate) at 1.2, triplet.

- CH2 (propionate) at 4.5, quartet.

- NH2 (broad singlet at 4.0).

The aromatic protons would be two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0, which matches. So the NMR data would fit C as well.

But then, the IR: the ester carbonyl is at 1720, which fits. The N-H in the amide would be in the IR, but option C is a propionate, which is an ester, not an amide. So the IR would have the ester carbonyl, and the NH in the amine. The amino group in C is -NH2, which would show N-H stretches in the IR around 3300-3500, which matches.

So now I'm confused because both D and C seem to fit.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So:

C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2 → 10/2 =5 degrees. Which could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds) + one double bond (ester or amide), so that fits.

For option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

The ester group contributes one double bond (C=O), and the benzene ring has three. So total degrees of unsaturation are 4 (from benzene) +1 (ester) =5. Correct.

Similarly, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) =4. Wait, that's only 4. Wait, no, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation for D.

D is C9H11NO2:

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So D has 5, which is correct.

So both C and D have the correct degrees.

But the IR in the question shows strong N-H stretches. Both D and C have NH2 groups. So the IR doesn't help to distinguish between them.

Let me look again at the NMR data. The signals are:

1.20 (t,3H) → CH3.

4.0 (bs,2H) → perhaps NH2.

4.5 (q,2H) → CH2.

7.0 and 8.0 ppm (each d, 2H) → aromatic.

So for option C, the propionate would have a CH3 (t, 1.2), a CH2 (q, 4.5), and a CH2 (maybe around 2.3 as triplet, but not present in data). The NH2 would be at 4.0 as a broad singlet. So that fits.

But for option D, the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 of the ester. If that's the case, then the NH2 would be a broad singlet. But the 4.0 in the data is a broad singlet for 2H, which would fit the NH2. So both D and C could fit, but the quartet in the data is 2H at 4.5. So for D, the OCH2 is 2H, quartet. For C, the CH2 is 2H, quartet.

Wait, so both D and C could have a quartet for 2H at 4.5. Hmm, but let me think about the number of peaks. In D, the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH3 in the ethyl group. So that's correct.

But in C, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a quartet because it's adjacent to another CH2. Wait, no, in propionate, the structure is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. The CH2 attached to the carbonyl (let's call it CH2a) is adjacent to CH2b (which is adjacent to CH3). So CH2a would be split by CH2b, which is a triplet, so CH2a would be a quartet. That aligns with the data's quartet at 4.5.

So both D and C have quartets at 4.5 ppm.

But how do I decide between D and C?

Another point: the NH2 in D is a primary amine attached to the benzene. The NH2 in C is also a primary amine attached to the benzene. So their NMR would be similar.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the splitting in the aromatic region. In D, the substituents are the ester (COOEt) and the NH2. The ester group is a strong deactivating group, while the NH2 is activating.

In the aromatic region, the H's next to the ester would be deshielded and appear downfield (around 8.0 ppm), and the H's next to the NH2 would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm), as I thought before.

In option C, the substituents are the NH2 and the ester group (propionate). So the same logic applies: H's next to the ester would be downfield (8.0 ppm), and next to NH2 would be upfield (7.0 ppm).

So that doesn't help.

Wait, another thing: the molecular formula. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Its formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count:

Benzoate ester (C7H5O2) + ethyl group (C2H5) + NH2 (adding one N and one H). Wait, no, the formula would be C8H8O2 (benzoate) plus C2H5 and NH2. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester is C9H10O2. Wait, wait, no. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would be C9H10O2 (since it's C7H5O2 + C2H5O). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the formula.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O-CO-OEt attached to benzene with NH2 at para. So the formula is C7H5O2 (benzoate) minus the H from the COOH (since it's an ester), plus C2H5 (ethyl group) plus NH2 (which adds N and H). So:

Benzoate (C7H5O2) → C7H5O2.

Ester: replace the H from COOH with OEt (C2H5O). So benzoate ester is C9H10O2.

Now adding the NH2 group: it's attached to the benzene, so adds N and H: C9H10O2 plus NH2 → C9H11NO2. Which matches the molecular formula. So D is correct.

Wait, no, wait. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ester would be C7H5O2 (from losing one H to form the ester). Then, adding an ethyl group (C2H5O) would make it C9H10O2. Plus the NH2 adds one N and one H (since it's replacing a H on the benzene). So total is C9H11NO2. Which matches the formula.

Similarly, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionic acid is C3H6O2. As an ester, it's C3H5O2. So the phenyl propionate would be C7H5O2 (benzene) + C3H5O2 (propionate) → C10H10O2? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. The structure is benzene (C6H5) connected to O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. That's C6 + 3 (from propionate) + 2 (O and CO) → C11? Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

The formula for phenyl propionate is C6H5-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So C6 + 3 (propionate) + 2 (O and CO) → Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate the molecular formula:

Phenyl group: C6H5.

Propionate group: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons, plus O and CO. So the propionate is C3H5O2.

So the total formula is C6 (from benzene) + C3 (from propionate) = C9. H: benzene has 5 H (since substituents are O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2). Wait, no, the benzene in 4-aminophenyl propionate has substituents at positions 4 and 1 (assuming propionate is at position 1). So the benzene is C6H4 (since two H are substituted). Then the propionate is C3H5O2, and the NH2 is adding one N and one H. So the total formula is C6 + C3 = C9. H: (4 from benzene) +5 (from propionate) +1 (from NH2) =10? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 10 H vs 11. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count again.

4-aminophenyl propionate: structure is benzene ring with NH2 at position 4 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 at position 1. The benzene has 6 C, 5 H (since two substituents). The propionate group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → that's 3 C, 6 H (CH2CH2CH3 has 3 CH2 groups, so 6 H). Wait, no. The CH2CH2CH3 is CH2CH2CH3 → that's CH2-CH2-CH3. So each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H. So that's 2+2+3=7 H. Plus the O and CO which don't add H. So the propionate group contributes 7 H.

The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). The NH2 contributes 2 H. So total H: 4 +7 + 2 =13? But the formula is C9H11NO2. That can't be. So perhaps I'm wrong in this assessment.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H (the CH2CH2CH3 group). So adding up:

Benzene: 5 H (assuming two substituents) → but wait, the benzene is C6H5 with two substituents, so 4 H. Propionate: 7 H. NH2: 2 H. So 4 +7 +2=13 H, but the formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that's a problem. Therefore, option C can't be correct because the molecular formula would have 13 H instead of 11.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, which has 5 H (since one substituent is the propionate, another is NH2). Wait, no. The molecular formula of 4-aminophenyl propionate should be:

Phenyl group (C6H5) → 5 H.

Propionate group: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → which has 7 H (the CH2 groups).

NH2 → 2 H.

But wait, the benzene has 5 H when it's attached to two substituents. So 5 +7 +2 =14 H → no, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe the propionate is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's a different group. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, making it a propiono ester.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the formula given is C9H11NO2. Each option must fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2. Ethyl group is C2H5. So C7 + C2 = C9. O2 from benzoate. Then, the NH2 adds one N and one H. So the formula becomes C9H6O2 plus NH2 → C9H7NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOEt → which is C9H10O2.

So, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C6H4(NH2)COOEt. So the formula is C9H11NO2. That matches. So D's formula is correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is C6H4(NH2)CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

The formula would be:

C6 (benzene) + 1 (CO) + 3 (propionate CH2CH2CH3) + N → C10H? Let me count:

Each CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (CH2 has 2 H each, CH3 has 3 H).

The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3).

The NH2 has 2 H.

So total H:4 (benzene) +7 (propionate) +2 (NH2)=13 H. But formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Therefore, option C can't be correct. So that leaves option D as the correct answer.
