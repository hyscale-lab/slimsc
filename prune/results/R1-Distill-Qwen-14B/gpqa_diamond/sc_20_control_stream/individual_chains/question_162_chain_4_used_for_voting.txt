Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my general relativity and differential geometry classes.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric, right? So it's a 2D spacetime maybe? Or perhaps it's a surface in 3D or 4D space.

Pseudosphere... Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere has an infinite area. But wait, wait. Let me clarify. The pseudosphere is a surface that can't be embedded in 3D Euclidean space without self-intersections, but in terms of its intrinsic geometry, it's a surface of constant negative curvature.

But the question here is about the area. So if we're calculating the area of the pseudosphere, what's the formula? I think the area of a surface with constant negative curvature is infinite. Because as you move along the surface, the curvature doesn't change, leading to an infinite area. Like, for example, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

But wait, the metric given here... Let me analyze it. The metric ds² is given in terms of x and y. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me see, so the denominator must be positive to have a real metric. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain of x and y is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface, not a plane. Hmm, maybe this is a different kind of model.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat because it's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) times (dx² + dy²). So in conformal coordinates, the area element would be the determinant of the metric times dx dy. The determinant of this metric is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))² times the determinant of the identity matrix, which is 1. So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. For a 2D metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². The determinant is g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})^2. In this case, since it's diagonal, g_{xy}=0, so determinant is (32/(4-x² -y²))².

So dA = sqrt(det g) dx dy. Which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the coordinates x and y are such that x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2. But integrating the area element over x and y in this disk would give the area of the space described by the metric.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. How does that connect?

Wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric for a pseudosphere in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (1/(1 + (y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²), but I might be mixing up models. Alternatively, perhaps the metric here is similar, but with a different coefficient.

Wait, the given metric is (32)/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm. Let me see: 4 -x² -y² can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So the denominator is 4*(1 - r²/4 ), where r is sqrt(x² + y²). So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - r²/4)) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - r²/4) (dx² + dy²). Which is similar to the Poincaré disk model's metric, right? The Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space has metric ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dx² + dy²). Wait, but our metric is (8)/(1 - (r²/4)) (dx² + dy²). Let me compute that denominator: 1 - r²/4 = (4 - r²)/4. So 8/( (4 -r²)/4 )= 8 *4/(4 -r² )=32/(4 - r²). Which matches the given metric.

So the given metric is the Poincaré disk model with a certain radius. The Poincaré disk model has a curvature which is constant and negative. The curvature K is given by -1/(radius)^2. Wait, for the standard Poincaré disk, radius is R, and curvature K= -1/R². But in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²). Wait, the Poincaré disk metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dx² + dy²), which corresponds to radius 2 because 1/(radius^2) would be 1/4, so 4/(1 - r²)^2 is 4/(1 - (r²)/(4))² * (4/(4))²? Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric. The Gaussian curvature K of a metric in 2D can be found using the formula involving the determinant of the metric and its derivatives. Alternatively, for a conformal metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y², the curvature is given by K = - (1/(2 f(r)^2)) [ (f(r)^2)'' + ( (f(r)^2)') / r ].

Wait, maybe easier to recall that for a metric in the form ds² = (a²/(b² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), this would represent a space with constant curvature. The Poincaré disk has metric ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r^2 dθ^2), which is a model of hyperbolic space with curvature K = -1.

In our case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So let me compare with the standard Poincaré model. The standard model has denominator (1 - r²)^2, but here it's (4 - r²). Let me write 4 - r² as 4(1 - (r²/4)). So the metric becomes (32/(4 (1 - (r²/4)))) (dr² + r² dθ²) = (8/(1 - (r²/4))) (dr² + r² dθ²). So that's similar to the standard Poincaré metric but scaled.

The standard Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). So if I want to relate the two, I can write our metric as (8/(1 - (r²/4))) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me denote r' = r/(2). Then, r = 2 r'. So, let's substitute:

r² = (2 r')² =4 r'^2.

So, 1 - (r²/4) = 1 - (4 r'^2)/4 = 1 - r'^2.

So, our metric becomes [8/(1 - r'^2)] [dr² + r^2 dθ^2] = [8/(1 - r'^2)] [ (2 dr')^2 + (2 r')^2 dθ^2 } ] ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should change variables more accurately. Let me make a substitution: r = 2 r'. Then, dr = 2 dr', and r² =4 r'^2.

Substituting into our metric:

(8/(1 - r'^2)) [ (2 dr')² + (2 r')² dθ² ] = (8/(1 - r'^2)) [4 dr'^2 +4 r'^2 dθ^2 ] = (8 *4)/(1 - r'^2) [ dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 ] = (32)/(1 - r'^2) ( dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 ).

Wait, but the standard Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - r'^2)^2) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 ). Hmm. So our transformed metric is (32)/(1 - r'^2) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 ), which is not the standard form. So perhaps the radius is different.

Alternatively, let's compute the Gaussian curvature K of our metric. For a metric conformal to flat space, ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r^2 dθ^2), the curvature is K = - (1/(2 f^2)) [ f^2 '' + (f^2 ') / r ].

Wait, maybe another formula. Alternatively, I remember that for a metric f(r) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 f^2)) [ (f')² + f f'' ] where f' is derivative w.r. to r.

Wait, let me think. The formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates for ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r^2 dθ²) is K = - (1/(2 f(r)^2)) [ (f'(r))^2 + f(r) f''(r) ].

So in our case, f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²). Let me compute f(r) as 32/(4 - r²), but wait no, because f(r)^2 = 32/(4 - r²) → f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = (4 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(4 - r²). Wait, 32 is 16*2, so sqrt(32) is 4√2.

Wait, so f(r) = [32/(4 - r²)]^{1/2}.

So f(r) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²) = 4√2 / sqrt(4 - r²).

So f(r) = 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-1/2}.

Now, let's compute f'(r):

f'(r) = 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^{-3/2} * (-2r) )= 4√2 * (r) (4 - r²)^{-3/2}.

Simplify: f'(r) = (4√2 r) / (4 - r²)^{3/2}.

Now compute f'(r)^2:

(f')² = ( (4√2 r ) / (4 - r²)^{3/2} )^2 = (32 r² ) / (4 - r²)^3.

Next, compute f''(r):

Hmm, let me compute f''(r). Let me write f(r) = 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-1/2}.

f'(r) = 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - r^2)^{-3/2} * (-2r) → Same as before.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute f''(r):

f'(r) = 4√2 r (4 - r²)^{-3/2}.

So f''(r) is derivative of this. Let me denote u = r, v = (4 - r²)^{-3/2}.

So f'(r) =4√2 u v.

f''(r) =4√2 [ u’ v + u v’ ].

u’ = 1.

v = (4 - r^2)^{-3/2} → v’ = (-3/2)(4 - r^2)^{-5/2} * (-2 r) )= 3 r (4 - r²)^{-5/2}.

So f''(r) =4√2 [ (1)(4 - r²)^{-3/2} + r * (3 r (4 - r²)^{-5/2}) ) ].

Simplify:

=4√2 [ (4 - r²)^{-3/2} + 3 r² (4 - r²)^{-5/2} ) ]

Factor out (4 - r²)^{-5/2}:

=4√2 (4 - r²)^{-5/2} [ (4 - r²) + 3 r² ].

Inside the brackets: (4 - r² + 3 r²) = 4 + 2 r².

So f''(r) =4√2 (4 + 2 r²) (4 - r²)^{-5/2}.

Now, putting f(r) and f''(r) into the curvature formula:

K = -(1/(2 f(r)^2)) [ (f')² + f(r) f''(r) ) ]

Compute each term:

f(r)^2 = 32/(4 - r²).

(f')² is 32 r² / (4 - r²)^3.

f(r) f''(r) = [4√2 (4 -r²)^{-1/2} ] * [4√2 (4 + 2 r²) (4 - r²)^{-5/2} }.

Multiply these:

= (4√2)(4√2) ) * (4 + 2 r²) (4 - r²)^{-1/2 -5/2}.

= (32) * (4 + 2 r²) (4 - r²)^{-3}.

So f(r) f''(r) = 32 (4 + 2 r²)/(4 - r²)^3.

Now, (f')² + f f'' = [32 r²/(4 - r²)^3 ] + [32 (4 + 2 r²)/(4 - r²)^3} ]

= [32 r² + 32(4 + 2 r²)] / (4 - r²)^3.

Factor 32:

=32 [ r² +4 +2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^3.

=32 (3 r² +4 ) / (4 - r²)^3.

So now, K = -(1/(2 * (32/(4 - r²)) )) ) * [ 32 (3 r² +4 ) / (4 - r²)^3 ) ].

Simplify denominator and numerator:

= -( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * [32 (3 r² +4 )/(4 - r²)^3 ) ].

Multiply terms:

= -( (32 (3 r² +4 )) * (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^3 ) )

Wait, let me do the math step by step.

Factor 32 in numerator, 64 in denominator: 32/64 = 1/2.

(4 - r²) in numerator, denominator has (4 - r²)^3 → 1/(4 - r²)^2.

So,

= -( (3 r² +4 ) * (4 - r²) ) * (1/2) ) / (4 - r²)^3 ) → Wait, perhaps better to write:

Wait, let's compute:

= -(32 (3 r² +4 ) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Because (4 - r²)/(4 - r²)^3 is 1/(4 - r²)^2.

So,

= -(32 (3 r² +4 )) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Simplify 32/64 = 1/2:

= -( (3 r² +4 ) ) / ( 2 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Wait, but that would imply that the curvature K is not constant, which can't be right because the metric is for a pseudosphere, which should have constant curvature. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Alternatively, maybe the metric given is not in the standard form of a pseudosphere, and perhaps the area is being asked for, regardless of curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The options include 4π(x² + y²), but area shouldn't depend on x and y. So option B and C are functions of x and y, but area is a global property. So likely, the correct answer is either 0, or +infty, or 4 pi (something). But option D is +infty.

But wait, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2 (since x² + y² <4). But in the 2D metric, the area would be the integral of dA over the disk. dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait, the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So Area = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Compute this:

Area = 32 * 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make substitution u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (1/u) (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ln |u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluate from 0 to 2:

At 2: (-1/2) ln(0) → which is (-1/2)(-infty) → +infty.

At 0: (-1/2) ln(4) → finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is (+infty) minus finite, which is +infty.

So the area is 32 * 2π * (+infty) → infinity.

Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature), which would have infinite area. So the correct answer would be option D, +infty.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not a pseudosphere but a sphere, but the question states it's a pseudosphere.

Wait, let me think again. The integral of the area element over the allowed region (x² + y² <4) diverges, which implies the area is infinite. So for a pseudosphere, which is a model of hyperbolic space, its area is indeed infinite. So the answer should be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. The domain of \(x\) and \(y\) is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. This metric is conformally flat, as it can be written in the form \(ds^2 = f(r)^2 (dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2)\), where \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) and \(f(r) = \sqrt{32/(4 - r^2)}\).

To calculate the area of the space described by this metric, we compute the area element:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \(\theta\)-integration contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), leaving:

\[
\text{Area} = 64 \pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\). Rewriting the integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_{u=4}^{u=0}.
\]

At \(u = 0\), \(\ln|u| \to -\infty\), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the total area diverges to infinity. This result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature and has infinite area.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect. The area is not zero; it diverges.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)** and **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect. These expressions depend on \(x\) and \(y\), but the total area is a global property and does not depend on coordinates.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct. The integral of the area element over the domain diverges, indicating an infinite area.
