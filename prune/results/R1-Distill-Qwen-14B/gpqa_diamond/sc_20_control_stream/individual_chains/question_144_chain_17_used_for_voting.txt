Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. They're asking for the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that when particles like mesons decay, their mean lifetime is related to their width. The mean lifetime τ is given by the inverse of the width, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, I think it's τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I think I might be mixing it up with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Let me double-check.

Wait, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense. Because Γ is the total decay rate, so the inverse gives the average time before decay.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the velocity of the particle. But wait, how do I find the velocity? I need to find the velocity of the meson X. Since it's produced with a certain energy, perhaps I can use relativistic equations to find its velocity.

The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is higher than the rest mass energy. That means the meson is moving relativistically. To find the velocity, I should compute the relativistic gamma factor.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c². So γ is E / (m c²). Given that E_X is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, I can calculate γ.

Wait, but the units are in GeV and MeV. Let me make sure the units are consistent. I think since both E and m are in GeV, I can just divide them without worrying about the c² factor. Because E and m are both in energy terms; the c² would be part of the units, but since they're in the same units, it cancels out.

So γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Next, how to find the velocity v from gamma? I remember that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v, we have:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Let me compute 1/γ²: 1/(6.6667)^2. 6.6667 squared is about 44.444, so 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is... well, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. So the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Wait, but maybe I can be more precise. Let me calculate it more accurately. 6.6667 is 20/3. So (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/(400/9) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775: let me compute that. Hmm, I know that sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99. So 0.9775 is between those. Let me approximate. Let's say 0.9887 as before. Alternatively, maybe I should just proceed with exact fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the beta factor (β = v/c) first. Since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), then β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So let me compute 1/γ²: (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1-0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, so β ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me think, 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775, so yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can use the relation that when γ is large, β ≈ 1 - (1/(2γ²)). But 6.6667 isn't that large, so maybe the approximation isn't great. Let me stick with the exact calculation.

Once I have v, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ.

So now, putting it all together.

First, calculate τ: τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. So I should make sure to convert ħ into units that are compatible, probably GeV·s or something.

I remember that ħ (reduced Planck constant) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ in SI units is about 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s, and 1 GeV is about 1.602 × 10^-10 J, so converting:

ħ in GeV·s is approximately (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = approx (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-10) ) GeV·s = approx 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So yes, 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ.

But Γ is 320 MeV. Oh wait, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that precisely. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is (6582 / 320) * 1e-25. 6582 / 320 is roughly 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let's compute that step by step.

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see:

2.966 * 2 =5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 = approx 0.1685.

So total approx 5.932 + 0.1685 =6.1005.

So 6.1005e8 * 1e-24 =6.1005e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 6.1005e-16 meters is approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, option D is 4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, that's a bit lower than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate τ.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) =6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, v is 0.9887c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply 2.9661 by 2.056875: let's compute that.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322

2.9661 * 0.056875 ≈ let's compute 2.9661 * 0.05 = 0.1483, and 2.9661 * 0.006875 ≈ approximately 0.02044. So total about 0.1483 + 0.02044 = 0.16874.

So total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.16874 =6.10094.

So L ≈6.10094e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-16 m. But the options are around 5e-16 or 4e-15, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating beta or gamma.

Wait, let me re-examine the gamma calculation. Gamma is E/(m c²), but since E and m are in the same units (GeV), the c² cancels out. So yes, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, let me compute 1/gamma squared. Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is 400/9. 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Hmm, 0.9887 squared is 0.97750369, so that's correct. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Hmm, so that part seems right.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I should use the proper formula for the mean lifetime, considering that the decay width is Γ, but sometimes the mean lifetime is also written as τ = ħ/(Γ_total), where Γ_total is the total decay width.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another point: perhaps I should consider that the decay width is in MeV, so I have to convert it to GeV. I did that correctly, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I used the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, but perhaps I should be using a more precise value. Let me check: c is approximately 2.99792e8 m/s. So 3e8 is close enough, but perhaps using a more precise value would make a difference.

Let me try that. Let me compute v as 0.9887 * 2.99792e8 m/s.

0.9887 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s, as before.

So the calculation of L would still be about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, but that's not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check that.

Wait, another approach: compute beta as beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Since E = gamma m c^2, then beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) )= sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/( (gamma m c^2)^2 )) )= sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

Which is the same as before. So that's correct.

Hmm. Let me think again. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is that the production energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the problem states E_X =8 GeV is the production energy. I'm assuming that's the total energy, but perhaps it's the kinetic energy. That would change things.

Wait, the question says "production energy is E_X=8 GeV". Hmm, sometimes production energy refers to the kinetic energy, sometimes the total energy. If E_X is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E = K + m c^2.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy is higher. Let me think: if E_X is 8 GeV and it's the kinetic energy, then the total energy E = K + m c^2 =8 GeV +1.2 GeV=9.2 GeV.

Then gamma would be E/(m c^2)= (9.2 GeV)/(1.2 GeV)= 7.6667.

Then beta would be sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)))= sqrt(1 - (1/(7.6667^2))).

7.6667 squared is approximately 58.7778. 1/58.7778≈0.017. So 1-0.017=0.983. sqrt(0.983)= approximately 0.9915.

So beta is about 0.9915, and v=0.9915c.

Then, recalculating gamma as 7.6667, let's see.

So, in that case, gamma is 7.6667, beta is 0.9915.

But wait, that would make the total energy higher, but the decay width is the same. Let's see if that changes the result.

Wait, but the decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau would be ħ/(0.32 GeV) = same as before, 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, the velocity v is 0.9915 * 2.99792e8 m/s ≈ 2.970e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = (2.970e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ≈ 2.970 * 2.056875e-16.

Compute 2.970 * 2.056875:

Wait, 2.97 * 2 =5.94, 2.97 *0.056875≈0.168. So total about 6.108e-16 m. Still around 6e-16. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is the total energy, but I have to compute the velocity correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity using the relativistic energy equation more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma as E/(m c^2) when E is the total energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units, where c=1 and ħ=1, but then convert back to meters and seconds. But I'm not sure if that's making it any easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean decay length: L = (v * tau) * (E c)/(m c^2) )? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the meson's lifetime is tau = ħ/(Γ), and the speed is v = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / (gamma m c^2 ) ?

Wait, no, I think I'm complicating it.

Wait, let me think about the calculation again.

The mean decay length is L = v * tau.

Where:

v = beta c,

tau = ħ/(Γ),

and beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, but E is in GeV, which is units of energy. So to compute beta, I can write E in GeV, m in GeV/c².

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute beta in terms of E and m without worrying about the units.

Wait, perhaps beta is given by sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)), because in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m, so gamma = E/m, and beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

Compute that: 1.2^2 is 1.44, 8^2 is 64. So 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1-0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887. So beta is 0.9887, which brings us back to the same calculation.

So L = beta c (tau).

So L = 0.9887 * c * tau.

Now, tau is ħ/(Γ) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So let's compute:

beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiplying those together: 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈6.1005. Then, 1e8 * 1e-24 =1e-16.

So L ≈6.1005e-16 meters. But none of the options are close to this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ.

Wait, let me check: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, is that correct?

Let me compute it with exact conversion factors.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

Reduced Planck constant ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.62607015e-34 / (6.283185307) ≈ approx 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Now, 1 GeV = 1.602176634e-10 J.

So ħ in GeV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) ) = approx 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So that is correct.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the mean decay length is calculated using the formula L = (c * tau) * beta gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Because sometimes the lifetime is given as tau, and the moving particle's lifetime is gamma tau, but wait no: the lifetime is tau, regardless of gamma. The moving particle experiences its own tau. But from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. Oh wait, that makes sense.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The particle's proper lifetime is tau, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time it lives as seen by the lab is longer. So the mean decay distance L is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau.

Wait, that's a key point I may have missed earlier. So let's think again.

So, the proper mean lifetime is tau = ħ/(Γ). But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the decay distance is L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, wait, no. No, wait: the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, because the particle is moving, so its clock runs slower. So the lifetime as observed in the lab is longer by a factor of gamma.

Wait, no, that's opposite. The proper time tau is the time measured in the particle's rest frame. So from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, because the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer.

So, the decay occurs at a time t = gamma tau after production in the lab frame.

So, the distance L is v multiplied by t, which is v * gamma tau.

Wait, but v is beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

But gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So, L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, let me compute that.

Beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667. So beta gamma is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈6.591.

Then, L = (beta gamma) c tau.

So, beta gamma is approximately 6.591.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 6.591 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculate 6.591 * 3e8 = 1.9773e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.9773e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9773 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.9773 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's compute that:

2 * 2.056875 =4.11375

0.9773 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.015.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way: 1.9773 * 2.056875.

Let me compute:

1.9773 * 2 =3.9546

1.9773 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1125.

So sum is 3.9546 + 0.1125 =4.0671.

So L ≈4.0671e-15 meters.

Wait, that's approximately 4.06e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.02e-15, etc.

So, this would make the correct answer option B.

Wait, so what was the mistake earlier? I think I forgot to include the gamma factor in the lab frame lifetime. Earlier, I used tau as the proper time, but I should have used gamma*tau for the lab frame time. So L = v * gamma * tau.

But wait, let me recheck.

The mean decay length is given by L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. The proper lifetime is tau, so t = gamma tau.

Thus, L = v * gamma tau.

But v is beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.

So, in this case, beta gamma is approximately 6.591, as I calculated earlier.

So with that, L is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Which matches option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by calculating the mean lifetime \( \tau \), which is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( v \) of the meson. The total energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) allow us to compute the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
v = \beta c, \quad \text{where } \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v \approx 0.9887 \cdot c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau.
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1005 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. Reassessing the calculation, we realize that the mean decay distance in the lab frame should account for the relativistic time dilation factor \( \gamma \). The corrected formula is:

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau.
\]

Using \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), we find:

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches option **B**. Therefore, the mean decay distance is:

**Answer: B**
