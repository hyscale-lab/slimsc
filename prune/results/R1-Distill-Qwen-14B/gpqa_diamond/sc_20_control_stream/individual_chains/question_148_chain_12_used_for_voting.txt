Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Binary compounds mean each contains Y and F. So Y is some element that can form multiple fluorides. The first substance, A1, is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition releases F2, I think. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing Xenon would mean it's a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is noble gas, so it's usually not reactive, but if A1 can oxidize it, maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing fluoride.

Then, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is probably YF, the simplest fluoride. That makes sense because fluorination would add fluorine atoms.

Next, adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So when A5 is in water, it breaks down. Maybe it's a salt that hydrolyzes? Or maybe it's a fluoride that reacts with water.

Wait, let's think about the compounds. Fluorine usually forms a lot of compounds, but Y must be a metal that forms multiple fluorides. Common such metals include elements like chlorine? No, wait, Y is an element that forms binary compounds with F. So Y is likely a group 17 element? Or maybe group 1 or 2? Wait, no, because group 1 and 2 typically form one fluoride each. Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus? Because phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, etc. Or maybe chlorine? No, chlorine is a halogen.

Wait, but the question is about Y forming multiple binary compounds with fluorine. So Y is a metal that can form several fluorides. Maybe Y is something like iron, which can form FeF2 and FeF3? Or perhaps Y is sulfur? No, sulfur can form SF2, SF4, SF6. But wait, the problem says five binary compounds. Hmm, so five fluorides of Y. That's a lot. Which elements have five different fluorides?

Let me think. Let's see, what elements form five or more fluorides. Let's think about transition metals. For example, iron forms FeF2 and FeF3. That's only two. Maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? No, Cl's fluorides are ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, and maybe others? Wait, phosphorus can form P2F5 as well, which is another form. Wait, maybe that's considered the same as PF5? Or perhaps PF3 and PF5 are the main ones. But that's two. Hmm, maybe five? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is fluorine itself? No, because the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with Y, so Y can't be F. Wait, maybe Y is silicon? Silicon forms SiF4. Not sure about others.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states. For example, lead forms PbF2 and PbF4. That's two. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is iodine. Iodine can form IF, IF3, IF5. That's three. Still not five.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur can form SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three. Not five.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal like tin or lead. Let me think: tin forms SnF2, SnF4, SnF6 maybe. That's three. Lead forms PbF2, PbF4, PbF6? So that's three. Still not five. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The problem mentions that A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes to give F2. Which red fluorides are there? One example is AgF, but that's not red. Wait, perhaps it's something else. Oh! Maybe A1 is ClF3. No, ClF3 is not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's F2O (but that's diatomic oxygen with fluorine, not a compound of Y and F).

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A1 is a compound like F2O (but that's not a binary compound of Y and F. Wait, Y is the other element, not O. So if Y is O, but the question says Y is the element, so probably a metal.)

Wait, let's try to think of the decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the reaction is A1 → A2 + F2. So A1 must contain F, and when it decomposes, it releases F2, implying that the F in A1 is in a higher oxidation state than in F2. Because F2 is 0 oxidation state.

Wait, but fluorine is usually in negative oxidation states in compounds. Hmm. Wait, fluorine has a -1 charge in most of its compounds. For example, in HF, it's -1. In FCl, F is -1. But in some compounds like ClF3, Cl is +3. Wait, maybe in A1, fluorine is in a lower oxidation state, and when it decomposes, it becomes F2 (0). So fluorine is being oxidized? Or maybe a metal is being oxidized.

Wait, maybe A1 is a more complex fluoride. For example, maybe it's a polyatomic fluoride. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a metal fluoride that decomposes to another metal fluoride and F2.

Wait, another thought: if A1 is a more complex fluoride, like YF3, which when heated decomposes into YF2 and F2. Wait, but that would require Y to have multiple oxidation states. For example, Y could be a metal like iron. So Y^3+ in YF3, and when decomposed, Y becomes Y^2+ in YF2, and F2 is released. That makes sense. So the decomposition would be: 2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2. So A1 is YF3, A2 is YF2.

But wait, why would A1 have a bright red color? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a different compound. Let me think of another angle.

A1 oxidizes Xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, but it can form compounds. If A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a fluoride where Y is in a high oxidation state. For example, something like YF6^3−? Or maybe a compound where Y is in a high positive oxidation state, making the fluoride a strong oxidizer.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the fluorine compounds. Fluorine (F2) is a strong oxidizer. So perhaps A1 is a compound that contains F in a high oxidation state, making it a strong oxidizer. For example, IF5 is a strong oxidizer. Or maybe O-F compounds, but Y is not O.

Wait, perhaps Y is iodine. Because iodine can form several fluorides. Let's think: IF, IF3, IF5, and maybe others. But I'm not sure if that's five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine. Chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal that can form multiple fluorides. Let's say Y is iron. So Y can form FeF2 and FeF3. That's two. Not enough.

Wait, the question states that there are five binary compounds. So Y must form five different binary compounds with fluorine. Let me think of elements that form five or more fluorides. Hmm. Maybe Y is molybdenum? Or perhaps it's another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is nitrogen? No, nitrogen forms NF3, but not many others.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. Hmm, that's three. Not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is arsenic. Arsenic can form AsF3, AsF5. Only two. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the decomposition. A1 → A2 + F2. So, if A1 is a metal fluoride, which when heated gives another fluoride and F2 gas.

Let me think about the formula. Suppose A1 is YFn, which upon decomposition gives YFm and F2. So, for example, YF3 → YF2 + F2. Let's write the reaction:

2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2.

So, the stoichiometry works because 2 YF3 would produce 2 YF2 and 1 F2. That makes sense. So A1 is YF3, A2 is YF2.

So, Y is a metal that forms YF2 and YF3. So Y could be iron (Fe^2+ and Fe^3+), but iron forms FeF2 and FeF3. Alternatively, Y could be Co, which forms CoF2 and CoF3.

Wait, but the question says there are five binary compounds. So Y must form five different binary fluorides. Hmm. Maybe Y is lead? Lead can form PbF2 and PbF4. Not five.

Wait, maybe Y is chlorine? No, because chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but that's three compounds, I think.

Wait, another approach: looking at the possible options for the molecular weight of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

So, we're supposed to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let's think about what A4 could be. A4 is a compound such that when Y is added in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

So, perhaps A4 is a salt that, when Y is added, produces another compound. For example, if Y is a metal, maybe reacting with a solution of a salt to form a different salt.

Wait, A4's solution is colorless and concentrated. Maybe it's a solution of HFO (like HF, but that's a weak acid). Wait, but HF is a weak acid, and it's colorless. So if Y is a metal, adding Y to a hot concentrated solution of HF might produce a different fluoride.

Wait, but the problem says it's a 1:1 molar ratio. So, perhaps Y reacts with A4 (like a salt) to produce A5. Let me think. Let's suppose A4 is YF5, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio would give YF3 and something else. Or perhaps A4 is a different compound.

Alternatively, A4 could be a metal fluoride. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

Wait, focusing on the decomposition of A1. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1 is YF3, A2 is YF2.

So, Y is a metal that can have +2 and +3 oxidation states, forming YF2 and YF3.

Now, the problem says that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with Y. So, Y must form five different fluorides. So, perhaps Y is an element that forms YF, YF2, YF3, YF4, and YF5. But I'm not sure which element does that.

Wait, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Let me think: phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, and maybe others? Wait, PF3 is a compound. Also, P2F5 is another. But that's two distinct compounds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is sulfur. But sulfur's fluorides are SF2, SF4, SF6. Only three.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is iodine. I2 can form IF, IF3, IF5. That's three. Not five.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach. The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon can form XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. So, if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe it's a fluoride where Y is in a high oxidation state. So, Y must be in a higher oxidation state in A1 than in A2.

So, if A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF2, then Y is in +3 and +2 oxidation states respectively. So, perhaps Y is a metal that can exist in +2 and +3 states.

Now, if Y is iron, for example. Iron forms FeF2 and FeF3. But does iron form five different fluorides? I'm not sure. Let me think: FeF, Fe2F, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead. Lead can form PbF2 and PbF4. Hmm, but that's two. Not five.

Wait, maybe Y is a transition metal with more oxidation states. Let's think of molybdenum. Molybdenum can form MoF4, MoF5, etc. Not sure about the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the five fluorides are the same element in different stoichiometries, like YF, YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5. So Y forms all these. Which element does that?

Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine. No, Cl forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three. Not five.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen. But O is diatomic, and the compounds would be OF2 and OF4. Not five.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a rare earth metal. Some rare earth metals can form multiple fluorides. For example, lanthanum forms LaF3. But I'm not sure about five.

Wait, perhaps it's not a metal but a non-metal. Let me think. Maybe Y is nitrogen. But N forms NF3. Only one.

Alternatively, maybe Y is fluorine. No, because then the compounds would be F2 with itself, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating the initial part. Let's try to proceed with the other parts of the question.

A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So, A3 is YF. So, the simplest fluoride, YF.

A3 can also interact with xenon. So, YF reacts with Xe. Under what conditions? Maybe Xe is oxidized by YF, or vice versa.

Wait, another point: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. So, perhaps A4 is a salt that reacts with Y to form A5. For example, if A4 is YF5, and adding Y would produce YF3 and HF. Or maybe A4 is HF, but that's a weak acid.

Wait, the solution is hot and concentrated. Maybe A4 is a metal fluoride. For example, if A4 is AlF5, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a compound of Y and another element with F. For example, Y and oxygen? Like YOF.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a salt like YF3, but that might not fit.

Wait, when Y is added to A4, which is a solution, perhaps it's a displacement reaction. For example, if A4 is a solution of a less reactive metal's fluoride, and Y is a more reactive metal. So Y displaces it, forming its own fluoride.

But the molar ratio is 1:1. So, perhaps Y reacts with A4 in a 1:1 ratio. Let me think. For example, if A4 is a salt like MgF2, and Y is Na. Then adding Na in 1:1 ratio would produce NaF and Mg.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt like FeF3, and Y is another metal like Zn. Then adding Zn would displace Fe, producing ZnF2 and Fe metal.

But then A5 would be ZnF2, which in water would decompose. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the final part: in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So, A5 could be a salt that hydrolyzes in water. For example, a salt like CaF2 might not decompose, but maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: A5 is HFO. Wait, no, HF is a weak acid. Or perhaps A5 is a fluoride that reacts with water, like NaF. But NaF is stable in water.

Wait, maybe A5 is something like CaF2·nH2O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a metal oxide. For example, if Y is a metal that forms an oxide when it reacts with a solution. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another angle: the problem asks for the molecular weight of A4. So, perhaps A4 is a fluoride with a higher molecular weight.

Wait, another thought: Y is chlorine. Then Y forms five fluorides: ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7 (if that exists), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a transition metal.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. Only three.

Wait, maybe Y is a diatomic element, like O2. But O2 forms OF2, O2F2, etc. Not sure.

Another approach: perhaps A4 is a polyatomic fluoride. For example, something like YF5. If Y is chlorine, then ClF5 has a molecular weight of Cl (35.5) +5*F (19) = 35.5 + 19*5=35.5 +95=130.5 g/mol. So that's within option D (110-130). But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. Adding Y (like Cl) to a solution of A4 (ClF5) in 1:1 ratio. But ClF5 is not very stable, and Cl is a halogen, so maybe the reaction would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF3. Molecular weight of ClF3 is Cl (35.5) +3*19=35.5+57=92.5. That's within option D.

Wait, but in the question, when Y is added to A4's solution, it forms A5. If Y is Cl, then adding Cl to ClF3 solution? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think about the possible options.

Wait, in the options provided, the ranges are 110-130 (D), 140-160 (A), 160-180 (C), 220-240 (B).

If A4 is ClF5, which has a molecular weight around 130, then option D would be the answer. Alternatively, if A4 is something else with a higher molecular weight, like maybe YF4, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt of YF5 and another cation. Wait, maybe A4 is a compound like NH4F or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a compound where Y is in a different oxidation state. For example, if Y is iron, and A4 is FeF5. Hmm, FeF5 is not a common compound. Alternatively, maybe FeF4.

Wait, the molecular weight of FeF5 would be Fe (55.85) +5*19=55.85 +95=150.85. That would fall into option A (140-160). So, if A4 is FeF5, then the molecular weight is around 150, which is in option A.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF4 with Y being a different element. Let's say Y is lead. PbF4 would have Pb (207.2) +4*19=207.2 +76=283.2, which is higher than any option here.

Hmm. Another angle: if A5 is a salt that decomposes in water, perhaps it's a hydroxide. For example, if A5 is Y(OH) something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if A5 is a fluoride that reacts with water, maybe it's something like YF2, which in water could hydrolyze to Y(OH)2 and HF. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, and when Y is added, it might precipitate as YF2 and release HF. For instance, YF5 + Y → YF2 + YF3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF6^3−, but that's more for transition metals like Co.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- Y forms five binary fluorides, so Y has multiple oxidation states.

- A1 (YF3) decomposes to YF2 (A2) and F2, so Y is in +3 and +2 states.

- A3 is YF.

- A4 is a compound that reacts with Y in 1:1 ratio to form A5, which decomposes in water.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF5. Then adding Y (in 1:1 molar ratio) would produce YF2 and HF. So, the reaction could be YF5 + Y → YF2 + 3YF + F2↑? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF3. Adding Y would produce YF2 and HF. So, the reaction equation would be YF3 + Y → YF2 + YF + F2↑? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF4. Adding Y could produce YF2 and YF2 again, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fluorides and their molecular weights. For example, if Y is chlorine, then YF5 (ClF5) has a molecular weight of approximately 130.5. So, option D is 110-130.

If Y is iron, YF5 would be FeF5, which is 55.85 + 5*(19)=55.85 +95=150.85. So that would fall into option A (140-160).

But how do I determine which one it is?

Another point: A1 is bright red. Which fluorides are bright red? I recall that AgF is white, but maybe some other compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of compound.

Wait, another thought: if Y is phosphorus, then YF3 is PF3, which is a colorless gas. Hmm, but the problem says A1 is bright red. So maybe Y isn't phosphorus.

Wait, maybe Y is a transition metal with colored compounds. For example, CoF3 is a dark blue solid. Not red.

Alternatively, maybe Y is manganese. MnF3 is not a common compound, but some fluorides are colored. Not sure about red.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound entirely, not a simple metal fluoride. Maybe a complex fluoride, like YF3·nH2O. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the bright red substance is ClF3. Wait, ClF3 is a yellowish-green liquid, I think. Not bright red.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of compound, like a coordination complex. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is more about the relationships between the compounds than the exact identity of Y. So, let's think about the formation of A5.

When Y is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt of Y and F, like YF, which is A3. But A3 is obtained by fluorination, so it's the simplest fluoride.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a different compound, like YF2. But A2 is YF2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a hydroxide or oxide. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is a fluoride that reacts with water, perhaps it's a metal fluoride that hydrolyzes. For example, NaF doesn't hydrolyze, but perhaps a more complex one does, like CaF2 reacting with water to form HF and Ca(OH)2.

Wait, CaF2 is almost insoluble in water, but it doesn't decompose. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps A5 is a complex fluoride, like YF4. When it decomposes in water, it could break down into YF2 and HF.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a salt that contains both Y and another element. For example, if A4 is a salt like NH4YF, adding Y could replace NH4 with Y, forming YF and NH4Y.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A4 is a salt of YF5 with another cation, like LiYF5. Then adding Y might not react, but if it's a solution, maybe something else happens.

Hmm. I'm stuck on identifying Y. Maybe I should think of the molecular weight of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, etc.

If A4 is YF5, and Y is Cl, molecular weight is ~130. If Y is Fe, it's ~151. So, depending on Y, the molecular weight falls into either option D or A.

Wait, the problem states that Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine. If Y is chlorine, which forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, and maybe others, but only three. So perhaps Y isn't Cl. If Y is Fe, which has FeF2 and FeF3. Only two, so that's not enough.

Hmm. Maybe Y is a transition metal with more fluorides. Let me think: perhaps Y is molybdenum. Mo can form MoF4, MoF5, etc., but not sure about five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine. Iodine forms IF, IF3, IF5. Only three.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the five fluorides are in different stoichiometries, such as YF, YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5. So, Y must be able to form all these. Which element can do that?

Well, phosphorus can form PF3 and PF5, but not sure about others. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a transition metal that can exhibit multiple oxidation states with F. For example, Y is Mn, which can form MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, MnF5, MnF6. So that's five fluorides. So Y is Mn.

If Y is Mn, then A4 would be MnF5 (assuming A4 is the highest fluoride). MnF5 has a molecular weight of Mn (54.94) +5*19=54.94 +95=149.94 g/mol. So that's 150, which falls into option A (140-160).

So, if Mn is Y, then A4's molecular weight is about 150, which is in option A.

But wait, does Mn form five fluorides? Let me think. Mn can have +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7 oxidation states. So, in fluorides, it can form MnF2 (Mn^2+), MnF3 (Mn^3+), MnF4 (Mn^4+), MnF5 (Mn^5+), MnF6 (Mn^6+), and MnF7 (Mn^7+). So that's more than five. So Y is Mn.

So, let's proceed with Y as Mn.

Then, A1 is MnF3, which decomposes into MnF2 (A2) and F2. So, the reaction is 2 MnF3 → 2 MnF2 + F2.

A3 is the simplest fluoride, MnF.

A4 is perhaps MnF5, which when Y (Mn) is added in 1:1 ratio, forms A5. So, the reaction could be MnF5 + Mn → MnF2 + MnF (maybe). Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, but when Mn is added to a solution of MnF5, what would happen? Maybe it's a reduction or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is of another salt. For example, if A4 is (NH4)2MnF5, adding Mn metal might reduce or oxidize it. Hmm, not sure.

But focusing on the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is MnF5, then its molecular weight is about 150, which is option A (140-160).

So, the answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular weight range of compound A4, given the relationships between several binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Relationships**:
   - Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine.
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF = 31.96%) and fluorine (F₂). This suggests A1 contains fluorine in a higher oxidation state than F₂.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is the simplest fluoride of Y, obtained by fluorination, likely YF.
   - A4 reacts with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Y**:
   - Y must form at least five binary fluorides. This implies Y is an element capable of multiple oxidation states with fluorine.
   - Transition metals like molybdenum (Mo) or manganese (Mn) can form multiple fluorides. For example, Mn forms MnF₂, MnF₃, MnF₄, MnF₅, and MnF₆, satisfying the condition of five binary fluorides.
   - Based on the decomposition reaction (A1 → A2 + F₂), A1 is likely MnF₃, and A2 is MnF₂. This aligns with the red color and decomposition behavior of certain fluorides.

3. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is a compound that reacts with Y (Mn) in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5. A plausible candidate for A4 is MnF₅, as it is a known fluoride of manganese.
   - The molecular weight of MnF₅ is calculated as follows:
     - Manganese (Mn): 54.94 g/mol
     - Fluorine (F): 19.00 g/mol × 5 = 95.00 g/mol
     - Total molecular weight = 54.94 + 95.00 = 149.94 g/mol, approximately 150 g/mol.

4. **Matching the Molecular Weight Range**:
   - The molecular weight of A4 (MnF₅) falls within the range of 140–160, corresponding to option A.

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 is in the range **140–160**.

Answer: A
