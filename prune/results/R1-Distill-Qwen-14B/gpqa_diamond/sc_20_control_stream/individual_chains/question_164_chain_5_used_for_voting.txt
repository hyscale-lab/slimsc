Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's read through the question again.

So, we have two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations with certain amplitudes. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are given as A to D.

I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is that as the stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities change, and we can measure these Doppler shifts.

Wait, the radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I recall is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M sin i) / (P)^(1/3) * (1 + M1/M2)^(-2/3) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Alternatively, I think that the mass function might come into play here. Or maybe it's the velocity semi-amplitude which depends on the mass ratio and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is related to the mass of the other star. Let me think. In a binary system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so it's moving slower, while the less massive star moves faster. So the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses. So if K1 is the velocity of star 1 and K2 is that of star 2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Wait, I think the correct ratio is K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s for system_1, then K1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2, which implies that M1 is half of M2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. So for system_1, K1 is 10 and K2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half as massive as M2 in system_1. Wait, but wait, because the system's total mass is M1 + M2. So the total mass of system_1 would be M1 + M2 = (0.5 M2) + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but that's for each system. Let me get this right. For the binary system, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So M1 = (v2 * (M1+M2)) / (K1) ), but perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, another approach: the mass function. The mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but I'm not entirely sure. But maybe I can think in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )^(1/3) ) , but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) ) * (1 + M1/M2)^(-2/3) ), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mass function, which is the formula that relates the observed velocities to the masses. The mass function f(M) = (K1^3 P )/(2π G ) ) * ( (1 + q)^2 ) / q^3 ), where q is the mass ratio (M2/M1). Alternatively, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the masses. Since in each system, the two stars have velocities K1 and K2, and K1/K2 = M2/M1. So for system_1, K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So K1/K2 = 2 = M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1 is 15, K2 is 10. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2 = 1.5. So M2/M1 = 3/2, so M2 = (3/2) M1.

Wait, but wait, what's the mass of each system? The total mass of each system is M1 + M2.

So for system_1:

M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

For system_2:

M_total_2 = M1' + M2' = M1' + (3/2) M1' ) = (5/2) M1'.

Wait, but wait, are M1 and M1' the same? No, because each system has its own M1 and M2. So in system_1, let's denote the masses as M_A and M_B, with velocities K_A and K_B. So in system_1, K_A = 10, K_B =5. So M_B = 2 M_A.

System_2 has K_A=15, K_B=10. So M_B = (15/10) M_A = 1.5 M_A'? Wait, no, no, in system_2, the masses are M_A' and M_B', and their velocities K_A' and K_B' are 15 and 10. So K_A' / K_B' = M_B' / M_A' → 15/10 = 3/2 = M_B' / M_A' → M_B' = 1.5 M_A'.

So for each system, the total mass is:

System_1: M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A = 3 M_A.

System_2: M_A' + M_B' = M_A' + 1.5 M_A' = 2.5 M_A'.

But how do we relate M_A and M_A' between the two systems? Because the periods are different, probably involving Kepler's third law.

Ah, right, the orbital period is the same for both stars in a binary system. So P is the same as in the question: system_1 has period 2 years, system_2 1 year.

Kepler's third law in the context of binary systems is: (P^2) (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a^3)/(G), but perhaps more useful for us is the formula that relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses and the period.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (1 + M1/M2)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (P/(1 year)) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for each system, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes gives the mass ratio. And the velocity amplitudes are given for each system.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the mass function. The mass function f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G ), where K is the velocity amplitude, and P is the period. But the mass function depends on the inclination angle i, which is the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight. However, if we assume that both systems have the same inclination (which is generally not the case, but perhaps in this problem it's acceptable), then we can relate their mass functions.

Wait, but the problem states that the periods are given as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. If the orbits are edge-on (i=90 degrees), then we get eclipses. So perhaps we can assume that both systems have i≈90 degrees, so sin i =1, and we can ignore that factor.

So, the mass function is f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) ) / (2 π G ), assuming i=90 degrees.

But wait, more accurately, the mass function is f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) ) / (2.15e5 ), where P is in years and K1 in km/s. This comes from the formula f(M) = (K1^3 * P ) / (2.15e5 ) [solar masses].

But the mass function f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2)^2 ) ), but when i=90, sin i=1. So f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2)^2 ) ) = ( M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) * ( (M1 + M2)/ (M2) )^2 ) ) → wait, simplifying, f(M) = ( M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) * ( (M1 + M2)/(M2) )^2 ) → Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, since the mass function is f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) ) / (2.15e5 ), and f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2) ) ), but when i=90, sin i=1. Then f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2) ) ) → but perhaps I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the mass function can be expressed as f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2) ) ), but when sin i=1, it's f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2) ) ), which can be rewritten as M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (M2 + M1)/M2 ) ) → because 1 + M1/M2 = (M2 + M1)/M2.

Wait, let me compute that denominator: (M1+M2)^2 * ( (M1 + M2)/M2 ) ) → (M1+M2)^3 / M2.

So f(M) becomes M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^3 / M2 ) ) → M2^4 / (M1 + M2)^3.

Hmm, so f(M) = M2^4 / (M_total)^3.

But since the mass function for each system can be computed using the observed K and P, and assuming i=90 degrees, perhaps we can compute f(M1) and f(M2), and then find the ratio of M_total for the two systems.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider the velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me think about the formula again. The velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (P/(1 year)) )^(-1/3) )

Assuming sin i=1 (edge-on), then K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (P)^(-1/3) )

But perhaps it's easier to write the ratio of K1 and K2 for each system, which gives the mass ratio.

In system_1, K1 = 10, K2 =5.

So for system_1, K1/K2 = 2 = M2 / M1.

So M2 = 2 M1.

Similarly, system_2 has K1=15, K2=10. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2 = M2 / M1 → M2 = (3/2) M1.

So in system_1, the total mass is M_total1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

In system_2, M_total2 = M1' + M2' = M1' + (3/2) M1' = (5/2) M1'.

Now, how do we relate the masses between the two systems?

Wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. For each binary system, the period P is related to the total mass and the orbital separation a.

Kepler's third law in binary systems is: P^2 = (4 π² a^3)/(G (M1 + M2)) )

But the problem is that we don't know the separation a, so perhaps we can relate the mass of each system to their periods and the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: the product of the velocity amplitudes (K1 * K2) * P = (2 π G )/(c^3) ) * (M1 M2 sin i )/( (M1 + M2) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product of the velocities times the period is proportional to the mass function.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that K1 * K2 = (2 π G )/(c^3 P) ) * (M1 M2 sin^2 i) / (M_total^2) )

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach.

Since the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses, and the total mass is sum of the two, perhaps for each system, we can compute the mass ratio and then find the total mass.

Wait, I'll try to write down the equations.

For system_1:

K1 = 10, K2 =5.

K1/K2 = M2/M1 → 10/5 = 2 → M2 = 2 M1.

So M_total1 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

For system_2:

K1 =15, K2=10 → 15/10=3/2 → M2' = (3/2) M1'.

M_total2 = M1' + (3/2) M1' → (5/2) M1'.

Now, how do we relate the masses between the two systems?

We need to find the ratio of M_total1 to M_total2.

But without knowing the actual masses, perhaps we can use the periods and the velocities to find the ratio.

Wait, I think I can use the formula that connects the velocity amplitudes, the period, and the masses.

Each star's velocity is related to the total mass and the period. The formula is:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_companion sin i) ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

Assuming i=90 degrees (so sin i=1), this simplifies to:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_companion ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

So for each system, we can write:

For system_1:

K1 = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2 ) / ( (M_total1)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / (P1)^(1/3)) )

Similarly,

K2 = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M1 ) / ( (M_total1)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / (P1)^(1/3)) )

Dividing K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = ( M2 / M1 )

Which we already knew, as 10/5=2 = M2/M1.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1' = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2' ) / ( (M_total2)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / (P2)^(1/3)) )

K2' = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M1' ) / ( (M_total2)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / (P2)^(1/3)) )

Dividing K1' by K2' gives M2' / M1' = 15/10 = 3/2.

Now, perhaps I can write the ratio of the K1 for each system.

But wait, perhaps another approach: for each system, the velocity amplitude is K = (v) = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_companion) ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

But let me think in terms of the velocity K1 for each system.

Let me denote system_1's K1 as K1_1 =10, and system_2's K1 as K1_2=15.

So,

K1_1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2_1 / ( (M_total1)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P1)^(1/3)) )

Similarly,

K1_2 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2_2 / ( (M_total2)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P2)^(1/3)) )

But M2_1 = 2 M1_1, and M_total1 = 3 M1_1.

Similarly, M2_2 = (3/2) M1_2, and M_total2 = (5/2) M1_2.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express M2_1 in terms of M_total1, and M2_2 in terms of M_total2.

In system_1,

M2_1 = 2 M1_1,

M_total1 = M1_1 + M2_1 = 3 M1_1 → M1_1 = M_total1 /3.

So M2_1 = 2/3 M_total1.

Similarly, in system_2,

M2_2 = (3/2) M1_2,

M_total2 = M1_2 + M2_2 = (5/2) M1_2 → M1_2 = (2/5) M_total2.

So M2_2 = (3/2) * (2/5) M_total2 ) → (3/5) M_total2.

Now, substituting back into the K1 equations.

For system_1:

K1_1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (2/3 M_total1) ) / ( (M_total1)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P1)^(1/3)) )

Simplify numerator:

(2/3 M_total1) → M_total1^(1) * (2/3).

Denominator: M_total1^(2/3).

So,

(2/3) M_total1 / M_total1^(2/3) = (2/3) M_total1^(1 - 2/3) ) = (2/3) M_total1^(1/3).

So,

K1_1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (2/3) M_total1^(1/3) / (c) ) * (1/(P1)^(1/3)) )

Similarly, for system_2:

K1_2 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (3/5 M_total2) ) / ( (M_total2)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P2)^(1/3)) )

Simplify numerator:

3/5 M_total2 → M_total2^(1) * 3/5.

Denominator: M_total2^(2/3).

So,

(3/5) M_total2 / M_total2^(2/3) → (3/5) M_total2^(1 - 2/3) ) = (3/5) M_total2^(1/3).

So,

K1_2 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (3/5) M_total2^(1/3) / (c) ) * (1/(P2)^(1/3)) )

Now, let's take the ratio of K1_2 to K1_1.

K1_2 / K1_1 = [ (3/5) M_total2^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) ) ] / [ (2/3) M_total1^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

= (3/5) / (2/3) ) * ( M_total2^(1/3) / M_total1^(1/3) ) ) * ( P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) )

= (9/10) * ( (M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

We know that K1_2 = 15, K1_1 =10 → ratio 15/10 = 3/2.

So,

3/2 = (9/10) * ( (M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 years) / (1 year) )^(1/3 )

Simplify the periods: 2/1 = 2 → 2^(1/3) = cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26.

So,

3/2 = (9/10) * ( (M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) ) * (2^(1/3) )

Let me write it out:

(3/2) = (9/10) * (M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) * 2^(1/3 )

We can rearrange to solve for (M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3).

Divide both sides by (9/10) * 2^(1/3):

(M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) = ( (3/2) ) / ( (9/10) * 2^(1/3) ) )

Compute denominator: (9/10) * 2^(1/3) ≈ 0.9 * 1.26 ≈ 1.134.

Numerator: 1.5.

So,

(M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) ≈ 1.5 / 1.134 ≈ 1.323.

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

M_total2 / M_total1 ≈ (1.323)^3 ≈ approximately 2.31.

Wait, that can't be. Because 1.3^3 is 2.197, and 1.323 is a bit higher. Let me compute 1.323^3:

1.323 * 1.323 = approximately 1.750. Then 1.750 *1.323 ≈ ≈ 2.319.

So, M_total2 ≈ 2.319 * M_total1.

Wait, but wait, that would mean system_2 has a larger total mass than system_1, which would imply that system_1's mass is smaller than system_2's. But the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Wait, that would mean system_1's mass is less than system_2's, so the factor would be less than 1.

But looking at the options, option B is ~0.6, D is ~0.7.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the ratio.

Wait, the equation:

3/2 = (9/10) * (M_total2 / M_total1 )^(1/3) * (2^(1/3) )

Let me compute the right-hand side.

(9/10) is 0.9, and 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.2599.

0.9 * 1.2599 ≈ 1.1339.

So,

3/2 = 1.5 = 1.1339 * (M_total2/M_total1 )^(1/3 )

So,

(M_total2/M_total1 )^(1/3 ) = 1.5 / 1.1339 ≈ 1.323.

So,

M_total2/M_total1 ≈ (1.323)^3 ≈ 2.314.

So,

M_total2 = 2.314 * M_total1 → M_total1 = M_total2 /2.314 ≈ 0.432 * M_total2.

Wait, so system_1's mass is about 0.43 times system_2's mass. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.43. That would correspond to option A) ~ 0.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me go through the calculation more accurately.

Let me compute 1.323^3.

1.323 * 1.323 = approximately:

1.323 × 1.323:
= (1.3 ×1.3) + (0.023 × 1.3 ×2) + (0.023^2)
= 1.69 + 0.0598 + 0.000529
≈ 1.7493.

Then 1.7493 × 1.323 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.7493 * 1.323:

=1.7493 * 1 =1.7493,
1.7493 *0.3 =0.52479,
1.7493 * 0.02 =0.034986,
1.7493 *0.003=0.0052479.

Adding:

1.7493 + 0.52479 = 2.27409.

+0.034986 →2.309076.

+0.0052479 → 2.3143239.

So, M_total2/M_total1 ≈ 2.314.

So, M_total1 = M_total2 / 2.314 ≈ 0.432 * M_total2.

Thus, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43. But wait, that would mean system_1 is less massive, so the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" That would be 0.43, which is approximately option A) ~0.4.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So, 0.43 is closest to 0.4, so option A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because when I set up the ratio, I assumed K1_2 is for system_2, but the way the systems are given, perhaps I should have considered K1_1 as the velocity for the first star in system_1, and K1_2 as the first star in system_2. But the problem states that in system_1, the two stars have amplitudes 10 and 5, and in system_2, 15 and 10. But perhaps the K1 and K2 are for the same type of star in each system. For example, perhaps in system_1, star A has K=10, and star B has K=5. Similarly, in system_2, star A has K=15, star B K=10. Thus, each system has its own K1 and K2. But when comparing the two systems, perhaps I should consider the same star in each system.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: in each system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. So, in system_1, star with K=10 is less massive than the one with K=5? No, wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to mass. So if a star has a larger K, it must be less massive. So in system_1, K1=10, K2=5 → so star with K=10 is less massive than the other. So M1 (for system_1) = mass of K=10 star is M1 = (M2 * K2 ) / K1 → M1 = (M2 *5)/10 → M1=0.5 M2. So M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2 → M2 = (2/3) M_total1.

Similarly, in system_2: K1=15, K2=10. So star with K=15 is less massive than the other. So M1' = (M2' *10 )/15 → M1' = (2/3) M2'. → M_total2 = M1' + M2' = (2/3 M2') + M2' = (5/3) M2' → M2' = (3/5) M_total2.

But perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the mass function for each system and then find the ratio.

The mass function f(M) is given by:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2.15e5 ) 

where K is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) is in solar masses.

But since I don't know the actual masses, but only the velocity amplitudes and periods, perhaps I can compute the mass function for each system and then compare them.

Wait, but for each system, there are two mass functions, one for each star. Because each star's velocity contributes to the other's mass function.

Wait, no. The mass function is a function involving both stars. So, for each system, if I have the velocity amplitudes, I can compute f(M) for each star, but perhaps they are the same.

Wait, the mass function for star A is f_A = (K_A^3 P )/(2.15e5 ), and for star B, f_B = (K_B^3 P )/(2.15e5 ). But perhaps they're not the same because the mass functions depend on the companion's mass.

But I think I need to consider that the mass function for each star is different, and each depends on the companion's mass and the total mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the mass function for a star is f(M) = (M_companion^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_total^2 (1 + M_companion/M)) ), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass function for each system, knowing that the mass function f(M) is the same for both stars in the system, regardless of which star's velocity you're using.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think: the mass function is derived from the RV curve of one star. But the formula for the mass function in terms of the companion's mass. So for system_1, when you look at star A's velocity curve, the mass function f_A = (M_B^3 sin^3 i)/( (M_A + M_B)^2 (1 + M_A/M_B )^2 ). Similarly, for star B's velocity curve, f_B = (M_A^3 sin^3 i)/( (M_A + M_B)^2 (1 + M_B/M_A )^2 ). These are different.

But perhaps I can relate the two.

But without knowing the inclination, which is same for both stars, perhaps I can use the ratio of the mass functions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between f_A and f_B.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should instead proceed with the first approach, where we found that M_total1 is about 0.43 times M_total2, leading to the factor being approximately 0.4, option A.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the period is the same for both stars in the system, but the periods are different between the two systems.

Another approach: the velocity amplitudes are related to the masses. So for each system, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2.

Wait, because the system's center of mass is stationary, so M1 * v1 = M2 * v2 → M1 K1 = M2 K2.

So, for system_1: M1 *10 = M2 *5 → M1 = (5/10) M2 → M1=0.5 M2.

Total mass M_total1= M1 + M2 = 0.5 +1 → 1.5 M2 → M2= (2/3) M_total1.

Similarly, for system_2: M1'*15 = M2'*10 → M1' = (10/15) M2' → M1' = (2/3) M2'.

Total mass M_total2= M1' + M2' = (2/3 +1) M2' = (5/3) M2' → M2' = (3/5) M_total2.

Now, using Kepler's third law for each system. The formula for the period is:

P^2 = (4 π² a^3) / ( G (M1 + M2) )

But a is the separation between the two stars, which we don't know. However, perhaps we can find the ratio of the a's.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula involving the velocity amplitudes: for each star, v = (2 π a sin i) / P.

But since sin i=1 (eclipsing), v = (2 π a ) / P.

Wait, but each star's velocity is v1 = 2 π a1 / P, and v2 = 2 π a2 / P.

But a1 + a2 = a, the separation.

Also, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1.

So a1 + a2 = a → a1 (1 + M1/M2 ) = a → a1 = a ( M2/(M1 + M2) )

Then, v1 = 2 π a1 / P → 2 π (a M2/(M1 + M2)) ) / P.

But, the velocity amplitude K for each star is given, so K1 = 2 π a1 / P → a1 = K1 P/(2 π )

Similarly, a1 = a M2/(M1 + M2).

So,

K1 P/(2 π ) = a M2/(M_total )

Similarly, K1 = (2 π a M2 ) / ( M_total P )

But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps combining the two equations.

We know that M1*K1 = M2*K2 → M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Let me denote q = M1/M2 → q = K2/K1.

So for system_1, q1 = 5/10 = 0.5.

For system_2, q2 =10/15= 2/3≈0.6667.

Now, the total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + q )

So, M_total1 = M2 (1 + 0.5 )= 1.5 M2 → M2 = M_total1 /1.5.

Similarly, M_total2 = M2' (1 + 0.6667 )= 1.6667 M2' → M2' = M_total2 / 1.6667.

Now, using Kepler's third law for each system.

P^2 = (4 π² a^3 )/( G (M_total) )

But a is related to the velocities.

Each star's velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P.

But a_i is the orbit radius of each star.

We have a1 + a2 = a.

And M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1 = q a1.

So, a1 (1 + q ) = a.

We also have v1 = 2 π a1 / P → a1 = v1 P/(2 π )

Similarly, a = (a1 (1 + q )) ) = (v1 P/(2 π )) * (1 + q )

Substituting into Kepler's equation:

P^2 = (4 π² a^3 )/( G M_total )

Substitute a = (v1 P/(2 π )) * (1 + q )

So,

P^2 = (4 π² [ (v1 P (1+q)/(2 π )) ]^3 ) / ( G M_total )

Simplify:

P^2 = (4 π² * v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) / ( (2 π )^3 G M_total ) )

= (4 π² v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) / (8 π^3 G M_total )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² / 8 π^3 → 4/(8 π ) = 1/(2 π )

So,

P^2 = [ v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) * 1/(2 π G M_total) ) ]

Multiply both sides by (2 π G M_total ):

2 π G M_total P^2 = v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 / (2 π )

Wait, perhaps I need to recompute that step. Let me compute the denominator:

(2 π )^3 is 8 π^3.

So,

= (4 π² v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) / (8 π^3 G M_total )

= (4 π² / 8 π^3 ) * (v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) ) / ( G M_total )

= ( (4)/(8 π ) ) * (v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) ) / ( G M_total )

= (1/(2 π )) * (v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) ) / ( G M_total )

So,

P^2 = [ (1/(2 π )) * (v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) ) / ( G M_total ) ]

Multiply both sides by (2 π G M_total ):

2 π G M_total P^2 = v1^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 )

Divide both sides by P^2:

2 π G M_total = v1^3 P (1+q)^3 )

So,

M_total = (v1^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) ) / ( 2 π G )

But v1 is the velocity amplitude K.

So,

M_total = ( K^3 P (1 + q )^3 ) / ( 2 π G )

But q = M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Perhaps instead, I can compute the ratio of the total masses M_total1 and M_total2.

Let me denote M_total1 and M_total2 as M1 and M2 for simplicity.

So,

M1 = ( K1^3 P1 (1 + q1 )^3 ) / ( 2 π G )

M2 = ( K2^2 P2 (1 + q2 )^3 ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, no, for system_1, M_total1 = ( K1_1^3 P1 (1 + q1 )^3 ) / (2 π G )

Similarly, for system_2, M_total2 = ( K1_2^3 P2 (1 + q2 )^3 ) / (2 π G )

So,

M_total1 / M_total2 = ( K1_1^3 P1 (1 + q1 )^3 ) / ( K1_2^3 P2 (1 + q2 )^3 )

Now, substituting the known values.

System_1:

K1_1=10 km/s, P1=2 years, q1= K2_1/K1_1 =5/10=0.5 → 1 + q1=1.5.

System_2:

K1_2=15 km/s, P2=1 year, q2= K2_2/K1_2=10/15=0.6667 → 1 + q2≈1.6667.

So,

M_total1/M_total2 = [ (10^3 * 2 * (1.5)^3 ) ] / [ (15^3 * 1 * (1.6667)^3 ) ]

Compute numerator: 10^3=1000, 2=2 → 1000 * 2=2000.

(1.5)^3 = 3.375. So numerator becomes 2000 *3.375 = 6750.

Denominator: 15^3=3375, 1.6667^3≈(5/3)^3=125/27≈4.6296.

So denominator: 3375 *4.6296 ≈ 3375 *4.6296.

Calculate 3375 *4=13500,

3375 *0.6296 ≈ 3375 *0.6=2025; 3375*0.0296≈99.72 → total ≈2025+99.72=2124.72.

So, 3375 *4.6296 ≈ 13500 + 2124.72 =15624.72.

So,

M_total1/M_total2 ≈ 6750 /15624.72 ≈ approximately 0.432.

So, M_total1 ≈ 0.432 * M_total2.

Which means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.43.

In the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4.

But wait, the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Which would mean if system_1 is less massive, this factor is less than 1. So system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43, which is approximately option A) ~0.4.

But looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the ratio step by step.

Compute numerator: 10^3 * 2 * (1.5)^3.

10^3=1000.

2 → 1000 *2=2000.

(1.5)^3=3.375 → 2000 *3.375=6750.

Denominator: 15^3 *1 * (5/3)^3.

15^3=3375.

(5/3)^3=125/27 ≈4.6296.

So 3375 *4.6296 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3375 *4 =13500.

3375 *0.6296 → 3375*0.6=2025, 3375*0.0296≈99.72 → 2025+99.72=2124.72.

Total denominator: 13500 +2124.72=15624.72.

So 6750 /15624.72 = ?

Let me compute:

6750 ÷ 15624.72 ≈ approximately 0.432.

So 0.432 is approximately 0.43, so option A is ~0.4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier steps suggested a factor of about 0.43, but perhaps I made an error in computing the velocities. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered both star's velocities for each system.

Wait, another approach: because in each system, K1 and K2 are for each star, perhaps for each system, the mass function is the same for both stars. So, perhaps I can compute the mass function for each system and then find the ratio.

The mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2.15e5 ), where K is in km/s, P in years.

But for a binary system, the mass function for each star is different. But perhaps the maximum possible mass function is when the inclination is 90 degrees, which we can assume here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the mass function for each system using each star's velocity.

For system_1:

Using K1=10: f1a = (10^3 *2 )/(2.15e5 ) → (1000 *2)/215000 ≈ 2000/215000 ≈ 0.009302 solar masses.

Using K2=5: f1b= (5^3 *2 )/(2.15e5 ) → (125 *2)/215000 → 250/215000 ≈ 0.0011628 solar masses.

But I'm not sure how this helps, because the mass function is a function of the companion's mass. So perhaps f1a corresponds to the companion's mass if the other star is more massive, but without knowing the mass ratio, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the mass functions.

f1a/f1b = (10^3 *2 )/(5^3 *2 ) ) → (1000 / 125 ) → 8.

Which suggests that the mass function for K=10 is 8 times that of K=5. But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the mass function f(M) is given by f(M) = (M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M1/M2 ) ).

But since I'm stuck, perhaps the first approach where M_total1/M_total2≈0.43 is correct, leading to the answer option A, ~0.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, mass ratios, and Kepler's third law.

### Key Observations and Relationships:
1. **Radial Velocity Amplitudes and Mass Ratios**:
   - For binary systems, the ratio of radial velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the mass ratio of the two stars. Specifically:
     \[
     \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_2}{M_1}
     \]
     where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.

2. **System_1**:
   - \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
   - From \(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_2}{M_1}\), we find:
     \[
     \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_2 = 2M_1
     \]
   - Total mass of system_1:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 2M_1 = 3M_1
     \]

3. **System_2**:
   - \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
   - From \(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_2}{M_1}\), we find:
     \[
     \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_2 = 1.5M_1
     \]
   - Total mass of system_2:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1' + M_2' = M_1' + 1.5M_1' = 2.5M_1'
     \]

4. **Mass Ratio Between the Systems**:
   - To compare the total masses of the two systems, we use the fact that the orbital period \(P\) is related to the total mass \(M_{\text{total}}\) and the radial velocity amplitudes \(K\). The formula for the total mass in terms of \(K\) and \(P\) is:
     \[
     M_{\text{total}} = \frac{K^3 P}{2.15 \times 10^5}
     \]
     where \(K\) is in \(\text{km/s}\) and \(P\) is in years.

   - For system_1:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = \frac{(10)^3 \cdot 2}{2.15 \times 10^5} = \frac{2000}{215000} \approx 0.0093 \, M_\odot
     \]

   - For system_2:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 1}{2.15 \times 10^5} = \frac{3375}{215000} \approx 0.0157 \, M_\odot
     \]

   - The ratio of the total masses is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{0.0093}{0.0157} \approx 0.592
     \]

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The calculation above suggests a mass ratio of approximately \(0.592\), which is closest to the provided option \(0.6\). However, based on the detailed analysis of the mass functions and the relationships between the radial velocities and masses, the most consistent result aligns with a mass ratio of approximately \(0.43\), corresponding to option **A**.

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times more massive** than system_2. 

Answer: A
