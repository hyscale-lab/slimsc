Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me jot that down. So, the degrees of unsaturation might give me some clues. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For this compound, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. So plugging in: (2*9 + 2 -11 -0 + 1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe one ring (like benzene) and some double bonds or substituents. 

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group. Could be ester, amide, ketone, etc. But given the options, probably an ester or amide. 

The 1H NMR data has several peaks. Let me list them:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely a CH3 group attached to something, probably an ethyl group. Because a triplet with 3H usually means it's next to a CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester, where the CH3 is adjacent to CH2.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an N-H or OCH2 group. Wait, OCH2 would be more likely a quartet or triplet if adjacent to a CH3. Alternatively, an amine nearby? Or maybe an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H. That's typical of an ethyl group where the neighboring CH3 is split into a quartet. Wait, that might be the case. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3, giving a quartet. Wait, but the CH3 is at 1.20 as a triplet, which would make sense if it's connected to a CH2 that's next to another group, like an ester oxygen.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H. So, it's probably a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an ethyl group (from the NMR), but wait, no, the ethyl group is in the ethoxy or ester part.

Wait, let's think about the options given:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But that would be meta, not para, so the NMR might show more complex splitting for the aromatic protons. But our aromatic is two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So maybe not A.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONR2. Wait, formamide would have the structure RCONH2. So if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the carbonyl is a formamide group. The IR would show the amide N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which fits. The carbonyl in formamide is usually around 1680 cm-1. But the IR given is 1720, which is a bit higher, more like an ester. Hmm, maybe not B.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-R. But 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4. Wait, but then the structure would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the protonated form? Or perhaps, maybe it's an amino acid derivative. Let me think. The NMR would have an NH group? But the IR shows the broad band too. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is as an ester. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's ethyl propionate, but wait, no. Let me structure the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEtO-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. So the benzoate ester would be OEt group connected to the carbonyl, and an amino group in the para position. So the benzoate would have the ester carbonyl, which gives the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That makes sense. So the ester's carbonyl is around 1720. The NH2 group would give the broad IR around 3300-3400, but wait, amines usually have broad peaks. So that fits.

Looking at the NMR data again. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:

The ester group would have an ethyl group attached. The ethyl group in an ester is typically split into a quartet for the OCH2 and triplet for the CH3. So looking at the NMR, 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl. Then, the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5 ppm. Wait, in the data, 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2H. So that's the OCH2 group. But wait, in the data, 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's the NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 protons usually show up broad but around 1-5 ppm. Wait, do amines show up in 1H NMR? If it's a primary amine, like NH2, it would be a broad peak, possibly around 2-5 ppm. But in the NMR data, at 4.0 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. That could be the NH2 group. Wait, but in an ester like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is attached to the ring, so it's a para-substituted benzene with NH2 and ester groups.

So the ring would have two substituents: NH2 and OCO2Et. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR. So the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks. The 7.0 ppm is the H ortho to the NH2, and the 8.0 is the H ortho to the ester group. Because the NH2 is a stronger deactivating group, the ortho protons would be deshielded, hence higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm would correspond to the H adjacent to the ester, which is more electron-withdrawing than the NH2 (which is activating but deactivating in terms of resonance). Wait, actually, the ester group is more deactivating than the amino group. So the H next to ester would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm.

So the NMR makes sense for D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, 2H. If it's NH2, but in D, the NH2 is attached to the ring. How would that appear? In the NMR, the NH2 protons would typically be broad, but maybe they are not observed if they are exchanging and broad beyond detection, or perhaps they are integrated into the 2H. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from something else.

Wait another option: maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. But in the case of ethyl ester, the OCH2 is connected to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 in the ester is typically around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Because the ethyl group in the ester is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be next to the CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, which matches the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H), which would be the OCH2 group. Then, the 1.2 ppm triplet (3H) is the CH3.

So now, what about the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet for 2H? That must be something else. Wait, perhaps it's not NH2. Because in the structure D, the NH2 is a primary amine attached to the benzene ring. In the NMR, the NH2 protons might be broad and possibly not showing up as a singlet but as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't D but another option.

Wait, let me think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The formamide group has a carbonyl (IR at 1720, which may be a bit high for formamide; formamide is usually around 1680). But the IR has 1720, which is more like an ester. So perhaps not B.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4? Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4. But wait, that would make the molecular formula? Let's see: benzene (C6H5) attached to NH, then propionoate (CH2CH2COO-) and an ethyl ester? Wait, no, in the formula, it's C9H11NO2.

Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H5-NH-COO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that's C10H13N O2, which is more than given. Hmm, maybe it's not an ester but a different structure. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is attached differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is ethyl propionoate. Wait, no, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is option D. Which fits the formula C9H11NO2. Let's check: benzene (6 C), ester group O-CO-OCH2CH3 (which is 3 C: COO and the ethyl is 2 C, but wait, the COO is part of the benzoate. Wait, ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH2CH3, which has 6 + 3 = 9 C, which matches C9. And the substituents on the benzene are COOEt and NH2. So the formula is C6H5 (5 H) + COOEt (which is O2, C3H5O2?), wait, no, let me count:

Benzoate ethyl ester: C6H5COOCH2CH3. The formula is C9H10O2. But our compound has C9H11NO2. So that's an extra N, and one more H. So maybe the structure is not D, but D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have C6H5 (with NH2) + COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes, that's correct.

So back to the NMR. So in D, the NH2 would be on the ring. How would that appear? The NH2 protons would typically show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR data, I don't see a peak in that region except the 4.0 ppm which is a broad singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up, but the data doesn't show the NH2. Hmm, that could be a problem.

Wait, looking back at the 1H NMR data: the peaks are at 1.20 (t,3H), 4.0 (bs,2H), 4.5 (q,2H), 7.0 (d,2H), and 8.0 (d,2H). So four peaks. So perhaps the NH2 is not showing up because it's a broad peak, and maybe the integration is off or it's not included. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's NH2, then that would make sense. But in D, the NH2 is -NH2 attached to the benzene ring. NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm and can be broad. So 4.0 ppm would fit. So the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group.

But wait, in the structure, the NH2 is on the ring. So the two H's of NH2 would be split into a singlet? Or would they be a doublet or something else? But if the NH2 is para to the ester, the protons on NH2 would be equivalent and possibly appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. That sounds plausible.

So, the 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) is the NH2 group. The 4.5 ppm (q,2H) is the OCH2 from the ester, which is adjacent to the ethyl group (1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H).

So for option D, the structure would have:

- A benzene ring with two para substituents: one is NH2 and the other is the ester group OCOOCH2CH3.

So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets: the ones ortho to NH2 would be at lower ppm (7.0) and those ortho to the ester would be at higher (8.0).

Putting this together, option D fits the NMR and IR data.

Wait, what about the other options again? Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. The carbonyl would be from the formamide, so IR at 1720 cm-1 might not fit. Formamide is usually around 1680. So IR would be a bit off for B.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4. Let me check the formula: Ph is C6H5, NH is connecting, then CH2CH2COO- which is C3H5O2. So total C6 + C3 = C9, H: for PhNH, it's C6H5NH- which is 5 H (Ph has 5 H if substituents are in para), then CH2CH2COO- is 5 H (CH2CH2COO- is CH2CH2COO-: the propionate would be CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would have more Hs. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, so CH2CH2COO-O-R? No, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the ester where the propionate is the acid part. So it's (4-aminophenyl) attached to the O of the propionate ester. Wait, maybe it's (4-aminophenyl) attached to the propionate as the ester. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-PhNH2. No, that doesn't make sense because the amino would be on the phenyl. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. 

Looking at the NMR for option C, the ester would have a propyl group. So the NMR would have a triplet from the CH2CH2COO group, maybe at around 1.6 ppm or so, but in the given data, the triplet is at 1.20 ppm, which fits an ethyl group, not a propyl. So the triplet at 1.20 implies ethyl, which would point more to option D or B.

So option C's molecular structure would have a propyl group, but the NMR shows an ethyl group. So option C is less likely.

Thus, after considering all options, the data points most strongly toward D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, which corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring and possibly a carbonyl group. The IR data shows strong absorption at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**, indicative of N-H stretches, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide. The ¹H NMR data includes:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, typical of a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet for 2H, possibly from an NH₂ group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet for 2H, typical of an OCH₂ group in an ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This structure has a benzamide group with an ethoxy substituent at the meta position. However, the NMR data shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which is more consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more characteristic of an ester than an amide. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This structure has a formamide group (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The carbonyl stretch for a formamide is typically around 1680 cm⁻¹, which is lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, the NMR data does not show the expected splitting pattern for a formamide. This option is also unlikely.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This structure involves a propionate group (CH₂CH₂COO-) attached to a 4-aminophenyl group. However, the NMR data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm, which corresponds to an ethyl group, not a propyl group. This mismatch makes this option implausible.

4. **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a para-substituted ester group (OCOCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (-NH₂). The IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the ester carbonyl, and the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH₂ group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm and triplet at 1.20 ppm match the ethyl group of the ester. The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) are consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. This option fits all the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me jot that down. So, the degrees of unsaturation might give me some clues. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For this compound, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. So plugging in: (2*9 + 2 -11 -0 + 1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe one ring (like benzene) and some double bonds or substituents. 

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group. Could be ester, amide, ketone, etc. But given the options, probably an ester or amide. 

The 1H NMR data has several peaks. Let me list them:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely a CH3 group attached to something, probably an ethyl group. Because a triplet with 3H usually means it's next to a CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester, where the CH3 is adjacent to CH2.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an N-H or OCH2 group. Wait, OCH2 would be more likely a quartet or triplet if adjacent to a CH3. Alternatively, an amine nearby? Or maybe an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H. That's typical of an ethyl group where the neighboring CH3 is split into a quartet. Wait, that might be the case. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3, giving a quartet. Wait, but the CH3 is at 1.20 as a triplet, which would make sense if it's connected to a CH2 that's next to another group, like an ester oxygen.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H. So, it's probably a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an ethyl group (from the NMR), but wait, no, the ethyl group is in the ethoxy or ester part.

Wait, let's think about the options given:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But that would be meta, not para, so the NMR might show more complex splitting for the aromatic protons. But our aromatic is two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So maybe not A.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONR2. Wait, formamide would have the structure RCONH2. So if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the carbonyl is a formamide group. The IR would show the amide N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which fits. The carbonyl in formamide is usually around 1680 cm-1. But the IR given is 1720, which is a bit higher, more like an ester. Hmm, maybe not B.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-R. But 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4. Wait, but then the structure would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the protonated form? Or perhaps, maybe it's an amino acid derivative. Let me think. The NMR would have an NH group? But the IR shows the broad band too. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is as an ester. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's ethyl propionate, but wait, no. Let me structure the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is OEtO-C6H4-NH2. Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. So the benzoate ester would be OEt group connected to the carbonyl, and an amino group in the para position. So the benzoate would have the ester carbonyl, which gives the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That makes sense. So the ester's carbonyl is around 1720. The NH2 group would give the broad IR around 3300-3400, but wait, amines usually have broad peaks. So that fits.

Looking at the NMR data again. For ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:

The ester group would have an ethyl group attached. The ethyl group in an ester is typically split into a quartet for the OCH2 and triplet for the CH3. So looking at the NMR, 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl. Then, the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5 ppm. Wait, in the data, 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2H. So that's the OCH2 group. But wait, in the data, 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's the NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 protons usually show up broad but around 1-5 ppm. Wait, do amines show up in 1H NMR? If it's a primary amine, like NH2, it would be a broad peak, possibly around 2-5 ppm. But in the NMR data, at 4.0 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. That could be the NH2 group. Wait, but in an ester like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is attached to the ring, so it's a para-substituted benzene with NH2 and ester groups.

So the ring would have two substituents: NH2 and OCO2Et. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR. So the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks. The 7.0 ppm is the H ortho to the NH2, and the 8.0 is the H ortho to the ester group. Because the NH2 is a stronger deactivating group, the ortho protons would be deshielded, hence higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm would correspond to the H adjacent to the ester, which is more electron-withdrawing than the NH2 (which is activating but deactivating in terms of resonance). Wait, actually, the ester group is more deactivating than the amino group. So the H next to ester would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm.

So the NMR makes sense for D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, 2H. If it's NH2, but in D, the NH2 is attached to the ring. How would that appear? In the NMR, the NH2 protons would typically be broad, but maybe they are not observed if they are exchanging and broad beyond detection, or perhaps they are integrated into the 2H. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from something else.

Wait another option: maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. But in the case of ethyl ester, the OCH2 is connected to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 in the ester is typically around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Because the ethyl group in the ester is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be next to the CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, which matches the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H), which would be the OCH2 group. Then, the 1.2 ppm triplet (3H) is the CH3.

So now, what about the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet for 2H? That must be something else. Wait, perhaps it's not NH2. Because in the structure D, the NH2 is a primary amine attached to the benzene ring. In the NMR, the NH2 protons might be broad and possibly not showing up as a singlet but as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't D but another option.

Wait, let me think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The formamide group has a carbonyl (IR at 1720, which may be a bit high for formamide; formamide is usually around 1680). But the IR has 1720, which is more like an ester. So perhaps not B.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4? Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4. But wait, that would make the molecular formula? Let's see: benzene (C6H5) attached to NH, then propionoate (CH2CH2COO-) and an ethyl ester? Wait, no, in the formula, it's C9H11NO2.

Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H5-NH-COO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that's C10H13N O2, which is more than given. Hmm, maybe it's not an ester but a different structure. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is attached differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is ethyl propionoate. Wait, no, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is option D. Which fits the formula C9H11NO2. Let's check: benzene (6 C), ester group O-CO-OCH2CH3 (which is 3 C: COO and the ethyl is 2 C, but wait, the COO is part of the benzoate. Wait, ethyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH2CH3, which has 6 + 3 = 9 C, which matches C9. And the substituents on the benzene are COOEt and NH2. So the formula is C6H5 (5 H) + COOEt (which is O2, C3H5O2?), wait, no, let me count:

Benzoate ethyl ester: C6H5COOCH2CH3. The formula is C9H10O2. But our compound has C9H11NO2. So that's an extra N, and one more H. So maybe the structure is not D, but D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have C6H5 (with NH2) + COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes, that's correct.

So back to the NMR. So in D, the NH2 would be on the ring. How would that appear? The NH2 protons would typically show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR data, I don't see a peak in that region except the 4.0 ppm which is a broad singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up, but the data doesn't show the NH2. Hmm, that could be a problem.

Wait, looking back at the 1H NMR data: the peaks are at 1.20 (t,3H), 4.0 (bs,2H), 4.5 (q,2H), 7.0 (d,2H), and 8.0 (d,2H). So four peaks. So perhaps the NH2 is not showing up because it's a broad peak, and maybe the integration is off or it's not included. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's NH2, then that would make sense. But in D, the NH2 is -NH2 attached to the benzene ring. NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm and can be broad. So 4.0 ppm would fit. So the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group.

But wait, in the structure, the NH2 is on the ring. So the two H's of NH2 would be split into a singlet? Or would they be a doublet or something else? But if the NH2 is para to the ester, the protons on NH2 would be equivalent and possibly appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. That sounds plausible.

So, the 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) is the NH2 group. The 4.5 ppm (q,2H) is the OCH2 from the ester, which is adjacent to the ethyl group (1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H).

So for option D, the structure would have:

- A benzene ring with two para substituents: one is NH2 and the other is the ester group OCOOCH2CH3.

So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets: the ones ortho to NH2 would be at lower ppm (7.0) and those ortho to the ester would be at higher (8.0).

Putting this together, option D fits the NMR and IR data.

Wait, what about the other options again? Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. The carbonyl would be from the formamide, so IR at 1720 cm-1 might not fit. Formamide is usually around 1680. So IR would be a bit off for B.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph4. Let me check the formula: Ph is C6H5, NH is connecting, then CH2CH2COO- which is C3H5O2. So total C6 + C3 = C9, H: for PhNH, it's C6H5NH- which is 5 H (Ph has 5 H if substituents are in para), then CH2CH2COO- is 5 H (CH2CH2COO- is CH2CH2COO-: the propionate would be CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would have more Hs. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, so CH2CH2COO-O-R? No, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the ester where the propionate is the acid part. So it's (4-aminophenyl) attached to the O of the propionate ester. Wait, maybe it's (4-aminophenyl) attached to the propionate as the ester. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-PhNH2. No, that doesn't make sense because the amino would be on the phenyl. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. 

Looking at the NMR for option C, the ester would have a propyl group. So the NMR would have a triplet from the CH2CH2COO group, maybe at around 1.6 ppm or so, but in the given data, the triplet is at 1.20 ppm, which fits an ethyl group, not a propyl. So the triplet at 1.20 implies ethyl, which would point more to option D or B.

So option C's molecular structure would have a propyl group, but the NMR shows an ethyl group. So option C is less likely.

Thus, after considering all options, the data points most strongly toward D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, which corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring and possibly a carbonyl group. The IR data shows strong absorption at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**, indicative of N-H stretches, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide. The ¹H NMR data includes:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, typical of a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet for 2H, possibly from an NH₂ group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet for 2H, typical of an OCH₂ group in an ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This structure has a benzamide group with an ethoxy substituent at the meta position. However, the NMR data shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which is more consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, the IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more characteristic of an ester than an amide. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This structure has a formamide group (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The carbonyl stretch for a formamide is typically around 1680 cm⁻¹, which is lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, the NMR data does not show the expected splitting pattern for a formamide. This option is also unlikely.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This structure involves a propionate group (CH₂CH₂COO-) attached to a 4-aminophenyl group. However, the NMR data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm, which corresponds to an ethyl group, not a propyl group. This mismatch makes this option implausible.

4. **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a para-substituted ester group (OCOCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (-NH₂). The IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the ester carbonyl, and the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH₂ group. The quartet at 4.5 ppm and triplet at 1.20 ppm match the ethyl group of the ester. The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm) are consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. This option fits all the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
