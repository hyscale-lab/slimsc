Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and jot down what I know.

The problem describes several reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are all point groups, which describe the symmetry of a molecule.

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what A, B, C, D, etc., are. Let me think about the possible reactions and products.

Starting with reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid and G is weak. Strong acids are typically like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak ones are like CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc. So, if C reacts with water to form A and two acids, perhaps C is a compound that can hydrolyze into different acids.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes, when a salt is hydrolyzed, it can form different acids. For example, sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacts with water to form NaOH and H2S, but that's not two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is something like a nitrate ester? Or perhaps a nitro compound?

Wait, reaction 1: A and B form C. A is solid, B is gas. Maybe A is an element. Let me think about elements that react with gases to form colored products.

Oh, wait! The product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a reddish-brown gas, but perhaps another compound. Or maybe it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, think about the reaction where a metal reacts with a halogen. For example, when copper reacts with chlorine gas, it forms CuCl2, which is blue, not red. Hmm.

Another possibility: maybe C is a compound like As2S3 (which is bright red). Or perhaps it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? Wait, As4S4 is a red solid, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another angle. Let's look at reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Wait, if B is a gas, maybe it's a halogen, like Cl2. Let me think: if D is a gas, maybe another halogen, but reacting 1:1 to make a solvent. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O? No, because D is a gas. Wait, another thought: maybe D is NH3? No, NH3 is a gas but when it reacts with Cl2 in 1:1 ratio, under certain conditions, it might form NH2Cl or something else? Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is oxygen (O2) and D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another gas, like H2. But H2 is a gas, but D reacts with B 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Not sure. Let me think about H. Solvents could be like H2O, ethanol, acetone. Wait, H is a solvent, so perhaps it's something like CH3OH (methanol) or CCl4, but CCl4 isn't formed from B and D with 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is O2, and D is another gas. Let me think about something else.

Let me go back to reaction 3: C reacting with water gives A and two acids. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps C is a nitrate salt, but when it hydrolyzes, it produces a strong acid and a weak one. For example, if C is NaNO3, then hydrolysis might not produce two acids. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (which is weak, but unstable) and something else. Hmm, not quite.

Wait another idea: if C is (NH4)2Cr2O7, which is a strong oxidizer. When it reacts with water, it might decompose into Cr(OH)3, NH4OH, and other products. Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is Fe, and B is S, then FeS could form. But FeS isn't bright red. Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu and B is S, forming CuS, but that's usually black. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a highly toxic gas, like H2S? Or perhaps something like phosgene (but I don't know the reactions here). Alternatively, E could be a cyanide compound, but that's speculative.

Wait, C reacts with D to form E. So, perhaps C is a metal carbide, and D is a gas. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction of C with D. Let me think about C being a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, but how would that react with gas D? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, which is a pale yellow solid. Reacting with water gives NaOH and O2. But O2 is a gas, so not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate salt. For example, if C is NaClO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, not sure about the products.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's imagine the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). 8 equivalents of B per A. So the formula could be A B8? Or perhaps A is in a certain oxidation state.

Wait, 8 equivalents suggest that each A atom reacts with 8 B molecules. So, for example, if A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is a -1 ion (like Cl-), then the formula would be A B4. Hmm, but 8 equivalents suggest 8 B per A, so perhaps the formula is AB8/2, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a +3 charge and B is a -1 ion. Then formula would be A(B)_8 → no, perhaps AB8 would be the formula? But 8 B per A. That seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination compound. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if B is a diatomic gas like O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 molecules. So if A is a metal, and B is O2, then perhaps A is being oxidized to form a metal oxide. For example, 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. But that's only 1 equivalent of O2 per Mg. Doesn't match 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas and each molecule contributes two atoms. For example, if B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8*2=16 O atoms. So if A is Fe, then Fe with 16 O atoms would form FeO8? I don't think that's a known compound. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, maybe B is a gas like Cl2. If A is Fe, then perhaps Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So 3 equivalents of Cl2 per Fe. Doesn't match 8 equivalents.

Hmm, perhaps A is a transition metal and B is another element. Alternatively, maybe B is SO2 or another gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about reaction 4 again: D + B → H (solvent). If H is a solvent, and D and B are both gases, maybe they form something like H2O. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. But then, O2 and H2 in a 1:1 ratio would form H2O? The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that’s 1:1 ratio in terms of molecules, but in terms of stoichiometry, it's 2 H2 to 1 O2. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. For example, when Cl2 reacts with CH4 in the presence of light, it produces HCl and CHCl3, etc., but I'm not sure if that's a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. But NH3 and HCl gas would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible symmetry groups for E and see if I can connect them to possible structures.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a two-fold rotational symmetry. Think of something like H2O2, which has a C2 axis.

B) D4h: This is a high symmetry group with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Examples include adamantane or the methane molecule (but methane is tetrahedral, which is Td symmetry, not D4h).

Wait, D4h is the symmetry of a square planar molecule, like [Ni(CN)4]^4-, but those are more coordination complexes.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite two-fold rotation axis. For example, CO2 is linear, but it has D∞h symmetry. Wait no, CO2 is linear with a center of inversion, so its symmetry group is D∞h. Alternatively, O2 and N2 also have this symmetry.

D) C2v: This is a two-fold rotation plus two vertical mirror planes. An example is H2O, which has a C2v symmetry.

So the possible options are symmetry groups of E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So perhaps E is a molecule with one of these symmetries.

Wait, if E is a linear molecule, it would be D∞h. For example, O2 is D∞h. But O2 is a diatomic molecule with each atom having a double bond, so O-O. But E is produced from C and D; perhaps E is something like a diatomic molecule.

Wait, what if E is O2? Or maybe another diatomic like O3, but O3 has a different symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly hazardous gas. One such gas is chlorine trifluoride, ClF3, which is a strong acid, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, maybe E is a cyanide compound, but that's not a gas necessarily.

Wait, perhaps E is HCN, which is a linear molecule. HCN has a linear structure (H-C≡N), so its symmetry group would be D∞h. Because it's linear with a center of inversion, so D∞h.

But if E is HCN, let's see how that would fit into the reactions.

Wait, but C reacts with D to form E. So, if D is a gas, maybe it's something that can react with C to form HCN. Alternatively, maybe D is F2 and C is something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for other clues. For example, in reaction 3, when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is a compound that can hydrolyze into two different acids, one strong and one weak, perhaps C is a metal salt. Let's think about metal sulfites. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (which is weak, unstable) and NaOH (a strong base, not acid). Hmm, but that produces a base, not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate ester. Or perhaps a nitrate salt. Wait, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) reacts with water but doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfamic acid derivative. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide, like H2S, but that's a gas, and C is a solid product. Not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride? For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) is a solid. When it reacts with water, it produces NH4OH (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). Oh, that fits! So in reaction 3, C is NH4NO3, which reacts with water to form NH4OH (F, which is weak) and HNO3 (G, strong acid). 

So, if C is NH4NO3, let's see what that implies for reaction 1. Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (NH4NO3). So A and B are the reactants. NH4NO3 is made from NH3 and HNO3, but perhaps in a reaction with a metal?

Wait, no, NH4NO3 can be produced by the reaction of NH3 with HNO3. But in that case, NH3 is a gas. Wait, but in reaction 1, B is a gas. So if A is a solid metal and B is a gas, maybe the reaction is a metal reacting with a gas to form NH4NO3. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). If C is a transition metal compound, perhaps a sulfide or oxide.

Wait, maybe A is copper and B is sulfur. Copper reacts with sulfur to form CuS (which is black, not red). Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another form is red. Or perhaps it's a manganese compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, nitrobenzene is a red liquid, but I don't think it's solid. Maybe a different nitro compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. If A is a metal and B is O2, then C is a metal oxide. For example, 2 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 equivalents of O2 per Fe, not 8. So not matching.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction of A with B to form C. 8 equivalents of B per A. So the formula of C would be A(B)_8. If B is a diatomic gas, each molecule contributes two atoms. So 8 molecules would be 16 atoms. So the formula could be A B8. But for most metals, that's a lot.

Wait, another possibility: B could be Cl- and A could be a metal with a high oxidation state. For example, if A is Os (osmium), and B is Cl, then the formula could be OsCl8. Osmium tetroxide is O=Os=O, but I'm not sure about OsCl8.

Alternatively, maybe A is a group 2 metal like Mg. 8 equivalents of Cl2? Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2. The reaction is 2 Mg + Cl2 → 2 MgCl2. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 per Mg. Not matching 8.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and the reaction is 8 O2 per A. So the formula of C would be AO4. For example, if A is Fe, FeO4 isn't a common compound, but maybe in some oxidizing conditions, it could form. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a coordination compound. For example, [Fe(CN)6]^3- is a hexacyanoferrate(III), which is a bright red color. Wait, that sounds promising. Hexacyanoferrate(III) is a reddish-brown solution, but perhaps the solid is bright red.

So if C is K3[Fe(CN)6], which is a bright red solid. Then reaction 1 would be A (solid) + B (gas) → K3[Fe(CN)6].

Wait, but K3[Fe(CN)6] is made by reacting KFe(CN)6 (potassium ferrocyanide) with something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Wait, in reaction 3: When C reacts with water, it forms A (the original solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if C is K3[Fe(CN)6], reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, I'm not making progress on this front. Let's think about reaction 4 again: D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is a common solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol, which is made from ethylene and water. But D is a gas; so maybe D is CO2 and B is something else. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl. NH3 (gas) + HCl (gas) → NH4Cl (solid), which isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is methanol (CH3OH), which is a solvent. How would that form? From CO2 and H2. So 2 H2 + CO2 → CH3OH? Not quite, the actual reaction is CO2 + 3 H2 → 2 CH3OH (with catalysts). But that's 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is SO3, but I don't think that forms a solvent. Hmm.

Maybe I should think about the possible structures of E. If E has a D∞h symmetry, it could be a linear molecule like O2 or HCN. If it's O2, then E is O2, a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But why would C reacting with D produce O2?

Alternatively, if E is HCN, then reaction 3 would be C + H2O → A + F (HNO3) + G (another acid). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the possible symmetries for E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, it would be D∞h. If it's a tetrahedral molecule, it would have Td symmetry, but that's not an option. If it's a trigonal planar molecule, it would have C3v symmetry, but that's not an option either.

So if E is a diatomic molecule, D∞h is likely. So perhaps E is O2 or another diatomic gas.

Now, considering that, let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If E is O2, then D would have to produce O2 when reacting with C. For example, if D is H2O and C is a strong oxidizing agent. But not sure.

Alternatively, if E is ClF3, which is a strong acid, but its symmetry is not D∞h. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, so its symmetry group is C3v.

Wait, another possibility: E could be SO2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. That would match option D.

Alternatively, E could be O3, which is a non-linear molecule with a C2v symmetry? Wait, O3 has a bent structure, similar to O2, but I think O3 has a C2v symmetry because of the bent structure and a mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, maybe E is a tetrahedral molecule, but the options don't include Td. So another thought: maybe E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry. So if E is H2O, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → H2O. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D. If E is H2O, then C would have to be something that reacts with D (a gas) to produce H2O. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to piece together the possible compounds.

Assuming that in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A (solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a nitrate salt, but that doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or a carbonate.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water wouldn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible acids. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak ones include CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc.

So if F is H2SO4, then perhaps C contains sulfur. Or if F is HNO3, maybe C contains nitrate groups.

Wait, reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Suppose C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, it might not hydrolyze into two acids, but maybe a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfamic acid derivative. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonamide. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. When it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal acid sulfate. For example, magnesium ammonium sulfate, MgSO4·NH4SO4·6H2O. But that's more of a hydrate and might not produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Another thought: If C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3-O-R', which upon hydrolysis gives RSO3H (a strong acid if R is electron-withdrawing) and ROH (maybe a weak acid depending on R). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate salt. For example, NaClO3. But when NaClO3 reacts with water, I don't think it produces two acids.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: 8 equivalents of B per A. Let's think about metals that react with a gas to form a compound with a high number of atoms.

For example, titanium reacts with chlorine gas to form TiCl4. The reaction is Ti + 2 Cl2 → TiCl4. So 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Ti. Doesn't match 8.

Another example: sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. 1 equivalent of Cl2 per Na. Not 8.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. 3/2 equivalents per Al. Not 8.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should instead think about the possible symmetry groups again.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group is likely D∞h (option C) or C2v (option D). If E is a bent molecule like O3 or SO2, it would be C2v. If it's a linear molecule like O2 or HCN, it would be D∞h.

Now, considering that E is produced from C and D, perhaps E is O2. So what would that imply?

If E is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2. So D would need to be a gas that, when reacting with C, produces O2. For example, if D is H2O, then C would have to be something that reacts with H2O to produce O2. But I don't know of such a reaction.

Alternatively, E could be ClF3, but its structure is trigonal pyramidal, so symmetry group C3v, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: E is a gas with C2v symmetry, like SO2. If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So D would have to be a gas that, when reacted with C, produces SO2. For example, if D is H2S and C is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN. So D would have to be a gas that, when reacted with C, produces HCN. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the other reactions. If D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Suppose H is water. Then D + B → H2O. But both D and B are gases, so maybe D is H2O and B is O2? No, because H2O is a liquid at room temperature. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, but their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which isn't 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol, CH3OH. Then D and B would be gases that react to form CH3OH. For example, D could be CO and B could be H2. The reaction would be CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH, but that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the options and the information given.

Given that E is a product of C and D, and considering the options for symmetry groups, if E is a diatomic molecule, it would be D∞h. So the answer might be option C) D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D.

But without knowing the exact structure of E, it's hard to choose. However, the fact that E is extremely hazardous and a product of C and D suggests it could be a diatomic gas like O2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but O2 isn't extremely hazardous. Highly hazardous gases include HCN, Cl2, SO2, NO2, etc. HCN has D∞h symmetry. Another thought: perhaps E is NO2, which is a red-brown gas. But NO2 has a bent structure, so its symmetry group is C2v.

Wait, NO2 has a structure where two N-O bonds are at an angle of about 134 degrees. Its symmetry group is C2v because there's a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. So if E is NO2, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

If E is NO2, then reaction 2 would involve C and D reacting to form NO2. So D would be something that reacts with C to produce NO2.

Alternatively, if C is a nitro compound, and D is something that can release NO2 upon reaction.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 produces two acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). So perhaps F is HNO3 and G is H2SO3 or H3PO4.

If F is HNO3, that would suggest that C has nitrate groups. So maybe C is a nitrate salt, and when it reacts with water, it gives HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid.

But then, reaction 1: A + 8B → C (which is a nitrate salt). If C is a nitrate salt, perhaps A is a metal and B is a nitrate source, like nitric acid.

Wait, maybe B is NO3^- but that doesn't make sense as a gas. Alternatively, B could be O2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Given all this, I think the most plausible symmetry group is C2v if E is NO2, or D∞h if E is linear like HCN.

But since the options are given, and without more info, I'll have to make an educated guess. Given that NO2 is a common hazardous gas with C2v symmetry, and if E is NO2, the answer would be option D) C2v.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 8 B molecules per A atom, possibly forming a compound like a metal oxide or a coordination complex. The bright red color of C hints at a transition metal compound, such as a hexacyanoferrate(III) complex.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure. If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or HCN, it would have **D∞h** symmetry. If E is a bent molecule like SO₂ or NO₂, it would have **C2v** symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C could be a salt that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, it might produce HNO₃ (strong acid) and another weak acid like H₂SO₃.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B could combine to form a common solvent like water or methanol.

### Analysis of Symmetry Groups for E:
- **Option A (C2)**: This corresponds to a molecule with a two-fold rotational axis, such as H₂O₂. However, E is described as extremely hazardous, and H₂O₂ is not hazardous enough to match the description.
- **Option B (D₄h)**: This symmetry group is typical for square planar or certain coordination complexes. However, E is a product of C and D, and there is no evidence to suggest it forms a coordination complex.
- **Option C (D∞h)**: This is the symmetry group of linear molecules like O₂ or HCN. If E were O₂, it would not align with the description of being extremely hazardous. If E were HCN, it could fit, but there is no clear indication from the reactions.
- **Option D (C₂v)**: This symmetry group is typical for bent molecules like SO₂ or NO₂. NO₂, a red-brown gas, is extremely hazardous and aligns well with the description of E. Its bent structure with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes matches **C₂v** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the description of E as an extremely hazardous gas, the most plausible candidate for E is NO₂, which has **C₂v** symmetry.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and jot down what I know.

The problem describes several reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are all point groups, which describe the symmetry of a molecule.

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what A, B, C, D, etc., are. Let me think about the possible reactions and products.

Starting with reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid and G is weak. Strong acids are typically like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak ones are like CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc. So, if C reacts with water to form A and two acids, perhaps C is a compound that can hydrolyze into different acids.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes, when a salt is hydrolyzed, it can form different acids. For example, sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacts with water to form NaOH and H2S, but that's not two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is something like a nitrate ester? Or perhaps a nitro compound?

Wait, reaction 1: A and B form C. A is solid, B is gas. Maybe A is an element. Let me think about elements that react with gases to form colored products.

Oh, wait! The product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a reddish-brown gas, but perhaps another compound. Or maybe it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, think about the reaction where a metal reacts with a halogen. For example, when copper reacts with chlorine gas, it forms CuCl2, which is blue, not red. Hmm.

Another possibility: maybe C is a compound like As2S3 (which is bright red). Or perhaps it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? Wait, As4S4 is a red solid, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another angle. Let's look at reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Wait, if B is a gas, maybe it's a halogen, like Cl2. Let me think: if D is a gas, maybe another halogen, but reacting 1:1 to make a solvent. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O? No, because D is a gas. Wait, another thought: maybe D is NH3? No, NH3 is a gas but when it reacts with Cl2 in 1:1 ratio, under certain conditions, it might form NH2Cl or something else? Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is oxygen (O2) and D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another gas, like H2. But H2 is a gas, but D reacts with B 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Not sure. Let me think about H. Solvents could be like H2O, ethanol, acetone. Wait, H is a solvent, so perhaps it's something like CH3OH (methanol) or CCl4, but CCl4 isn't formed from B and D with 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is O2, and D is another gas. Let me think about something else.

Let me go back to reaction 3: C reacting with water gives A and two acids. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps C is a nitrate salt, but when it hydrolyzes, it produces a strong acid and a weak one. For example, if C is NaNO3, then hydrolysis might not produce two acids. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (which is weak, but unstable) and something else. Hmm, not quite.

Wait another idea: if C is (NH4)2Cr2O7, which is a strong oxidizer. When it reacts with water, it might decompose into Cr(OH)3, NH4OH, and other products. Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is Fe, and B is S, then FeS could form. But FeS isn't bright red. Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu and B is S, forming CuS, but that's usually black. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a highly toxic gas, like H2S? Or perhaps something like phosgene (but I don't know the reactions here). Alternatively, E could be a cyanide compound, but that's speculative.

Wait, C reacts with D to form E. So, perhaps C is a metal carbide, and D is a gas. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction of C with D. Let me think about C being a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, but how would that react with gas D? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, which is a pale yellow solid. Reacting with water gives NaOH and O2. But O2 is a gas, so not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate salt. For example, if C is NaClO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, not sure about the products.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's imagine the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). 8 equivalents of B per A. So the formula could be A B8? Or perhaps A is in a certain oxidation state.

Wait, 8 equivalents suggest that each A atom reacts with 8 B molecules. So, for example, if A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is a -1 ion (like Cl-), then the formula would be A B4. Hmm, but 8 equivalents suggest 8 B per A, so perhaps the formula is AB8/2, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a +3 charge and B is a -1 ion. Then formula would be A(B)_8 → no, perhaps AB8 would be the formula? But 8 B per A. That seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination compound. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if B is a diatomic gas like O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 molecules. So if A is a metal, and B is O2, then perhaps A is being oxidized to form a metal oxide. For example, 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. But that's only 1 equivalent of O2 per Mg. Doesn't match 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas and each molecule contributes two atoms. For example, if B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8*2=16 O atoms. So if A is Fe, then Fe with 16 O atoms would form FeO8? I don't think that's a known compound. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, maybe B is a gas like Cl2. If A is Fe, then perhaps Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So 3 equivalents of Cl2 per Fe. Doesn't match 8 equivalents.

Hmm, perhaps A is a transition metal and B is another element. Alternatively, maybe B is SO2 or another gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about reaction 4 again: D + B → H (solvent). If H is a solvent, and D and B are both gases, maybe they form something like H2O. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. But then, O2 and H2 in a 1:1 ratio would form H2O? The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that’s 1:1 ratio in terms of molecules, but in terms of stoichiometry, it's 2 H2 to 1 O2. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. For example, when Cl2 reacts with CH4 in the presence of light, it produces HCl and CHCl3, etc., but I'm not sure if that's a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. But NH3 and HCl gas would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible symmetry groups for E and see if I can connect them to possible structures.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a two-fold rotational symmetry. Think of something like H2O2, which has a C2 axis.

B) D4h: This is a high symmetry group with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Examples include adamantane or the methane molecule (but methane is tetrahedral, which is Td symmetry, not D4h).

Wait, D4h is the symmetry of a square planar molecule, like [Ni(CN)4]^4-, but those are more coordination complexes.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite two-fold rotation axis. For example, CO2 is linear, but it has D∞h symmetry. Wait no, CO2 is linear with a center of inversion, so its symmetry group is D∞h. Alternatively, O2 and N2 also have this symmetry.

D) C2v: This is a two-fold rotation plus two vertical mirror planes. An example is H2O, which has a C2v symmetry.

So the possible options are symmetry groups of E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So perhaps E is a molecule with one of these symmetries.

Wait, if E is a linear molecule, it would be D∞h. For example, O2 is D∞h. But O2 is a diatomic molecule with each atom having a double bond, so O-O. But E is produced from C and D; perhaps E is something like a diatomic molecule.

Wait, what if E is O2? Or maybe another diatomic like O3, but O3 has a different symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly hazardous gas. One such gas is chlorine trifluoride, ClF3, which is a strong acid, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, maybe E is a cyanide compound, but that's not a gas necessarily.

Wait, perhaps E is HCN, which is a linear molecule. HCN has a linear structure (H-C≡N), so its symmetry group would be D∞h. Because it's linear with a center of inversion, so D∞h.

But if E is HCN, let's see how that would fit into the reactions.

Wait, but C reacts with D to form E. So, if D is a gas, maybe it's something that can react with C to form HCN. Alternatively, maybe D is F2 and C is something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for other clues. For example, in reaction 3, when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is a compound that can hydrolyze into two different acids, one strong and one weak, perhaps C is a metal salt. Let's think about metal sulfites. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (which is weak, unstable) and NaOH (a strong base, not acid). Hmm, but that produces a base, not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate ester. Or perhaps a nitrate salt. Wait, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) reacts with water but doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfamic acid derivative. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide, like H2S, but that's a gas, and C is a solid product. Not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride? For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) is a solid. When it reacts with water, it produces NH4OH (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). Oh, that fits! So in reaction 3, C is NH4NO3, which reacts with water to form NH4OH (F, which is weak) and HNO3 (G, strong acid). 

So, if C is NH4NO3, let's see what that implies for reaction 1. Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (NH4NO3). So A and B are the reactants. NH4NO3 is made from NH3 and HNO3, but perhaps in a reaction with a metal?

Wait, no, NH4NO3 can be produced by the reaction of NH3 with HNO3. But in that case, NH3 is a gas. Wait, but in reaction 1, B is a gas. So if A is a solid metal and B is a gas, maybe the reaction is a metal reacting with a gas to form NH4NO3. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). If C is a transition metal compound, perhaps a sulfide or oxide.

Wait, maybe A is copper and B is sulfur. Copper reacts with sulfur to form CuS (which is black, not red). Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another form is red. Or perhaps it's a manganese compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, nitrobenzene is a red liquid, but I don't think it's solid. Maybe a different nitro compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. If A is a metal and B is O2, then C is a metal oxide. For example, 2 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 equivalents of O2 per Fe, not 8. So not matching.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction of A with B to form C. 8 equivalents of B per A. So the formula of C would be A(B)_8. If B is a diatomic gas, each molecule contributes two atoms. So 8 molecules would be 16 atoms. So the formula could be A B8. But for most metals, that's a lot.

Wait, another possibility: B could be Cl- and A could be a metal with a high oxidation state. For example, if A is Os (osmium), and B is Cl, then the formula could be OsCl8. Osmium tetroxide is O=Os=O, but I'm not sure about OsCl8.

Alternatively, maybe A is a group 2 metal like Mg. 8 equivalents of Cl2? Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2. The reaction is 2 Mg + Cl2 → 2 MgCl2. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 per Mg. Not matching 8.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and the reaction is 8 O2 per A. So the formula of C would be AO4. For example, if A is Fe, FeO4 isn't a common compound, but maybe in some oxidizing conditions, it could form. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a coordination compound. For example, [Fe(CN)6]^3- is a hexacyanoferrate(III), which is a bright red color. Wait, that sounds promising. Hexacyanoferrate(III) is a reddish-brown solution, but perhaps the solid is bright red.

So if C is K3[Fe(CN)6], which is a bright red solid. Then reaction 1 would be A (solid) + B (gas) → K3[Fe(CN)6].

Wait, but K3[Fe(CN)6] is made by reacting KFe(CN)6 (potassium ferrocyanide) with something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Wait, in reaction 3: When C reacts with water, it forms A (the original solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if C is K3[Fe(CN)6], reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, I'm not making progress on this front. Let's think about reaction 4 again: D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is a common solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol, which is made from ethylene and water. But D is a gas; so maybe D is CO2 and B is something else. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl. NH3 (gas) + HCl (gas) → NH4Cl (solid), which isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is methanol (CH3OH), which is a solvent. How would that form? From CO2 and H2. So 2 H2 + CO2 → CH3OH? Not quite, the actual reaction is CO2 + 3 H2 → 2 CH3OH (with catalysts). But that's 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is SO3, but I don't think that forms a solvent. Hmm.

Maybe I should think about the possible structures of E. If E has a D∞h symmetry, it could be a linear molecule like O2 or HCN. If it's O2, then E is O2, a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But why would C reacting with D produce O2?

Alternatively, if E is HCN, then reaction 3 would be C + H2O → A + F (HNO3) + G (another acid). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the possible symmetries for E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, it would be D∞h. If it's a tetrahedral molecule, it would have Td symmetry, but that's not an option. If it's a trigonal planar molecule, it would have C3v symmetry, but that's not an option either.

So if E is a diatomic molecule, D∞h is likely. So perhaps E is O2 or another diatomic gas.

Now, considering that, let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If E is O2, then D would have to produce O2 when reacting with C. For example, if D is H2O and C is a strong oxidizing agent. But not sure.

Alternatively, if E is ClF3, which is a strong acid, but its symmetry is not D∞h. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, so its symmetry group is C3v.

Wait, another possibility: E could be SO2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. That would match option D.

Alternatively, E could be O3, which is a non-linear molecule with a C2v symmetry? Wait, O3 has a bent structure, similar to O2, but I think O3 has a C2v symmetry because of the bent structure and a mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, maybe E is a tetrahedral molecule, but the options don't include Td. So another thought: maybe E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry. So if E is H2O, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → H2O. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D. If E is H2O, then C would have to be something that reacts with D (a gas) to produce H2O. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to piece together the possible compounds.

Assuming that in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A (solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a nitrate salt, but that doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or a carbonate.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water wouldn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible acids. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak ones include CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc.

So if F is H2SO4, then perhaps C contains sulfur. Or if F is HNO3, maybe C contains nitrate groups.

Wait, reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Suppose C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, it might not hydrolyze into two acids, but maybe a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfamic acid derivative. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonamide. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. When it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal acid sulfate. For example, magnesium ammonium sulfate, MgSO4·NH4SO4·6H2O. But that's more of a hydrate and might not produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Another thought: If C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3-O-R', which upon hydrolysis gives RSO3H (a strong acid if R is electron-withdrawing) and ROH (maybe a weak acid depending on R). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate salt. For example, NaClO3. But when NaClO3 reacts with water, I don't think it produces two acids.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: 8 equivalents of B per A. Let's think about metals that react with a gas to form a compound with a high number of atoms.

For example, titanium reacts with chlorine gas to form TiCl4. The reaction is Ti + 2 Cl2 → TiCl4. So 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Ti. Doesn't match 8.

Another example: sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. 1 equivalent of Cl2 per Na. Not 8.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. 3/2 equivalents per Al. Not 8.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should instead think about the possible symmetry groups again.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group is likely D∞h (option C) or C2v (option D). If E is a bent molecule like O3 or SO2, it would be C2v. If it's a linear molecule like O2 or HCN, it would be D∞h.

Now, considering that E is produced from C and D, perhaps E is O2. So what would that imply?

If E is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2. So D would need to be a gas that, when reacting with C, produces O2. For example, if D is H2O, then C would have to be something that reacts with H2O to produce O2. But I don't know of such a reaction.

Alternatively, E could be ClF3, but its structure is trigonal pyramidal, so symmetry group C3v, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: E is a gas with C2v symmetry, like SO2. If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So D would have to be a gas that, when reacted with C, produces SO2. For example, if D is H2S and C is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN. So D would have to be a gas that, when reacted with C, produces HCN. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the other reactions. If D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Suppose H is water. Then D + B → H2O. But both D and B are gases, so maybe D is H2O and B is O2? No, because H2O is a liquid at room temperature. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, but their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which isn't 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol, CH3OH. Then D and B would be gases that react to form CH3OH. For example, D could be CO and B could be H2. The reaction would be CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH, but that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the options and the information given.

Given that E is a product of C and D, and considering the options for symmetry groups, if E is a diatomic molecule, it would be D∞h. So the answer might be option C) D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D.

But without knowing the exact structure of E, it's hard to choose. However, the fact that E is extremely hazardous and a product of C and D suggests it could be a diatomic gas like O2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but O2 isn't extremely hazardous. Highly hazardous gases include HCN, Cl2, SO2, NO2, etc. HCN has D∞h symmetry. Another thought: perhaps E is NO2, which is a red-brown gas. But NO2 has a bent structure, so its symmetry group is C2v.

Wait, NO2 has a structure where two N-O bonds are at an angle of about 134 degrees. Its symmetry group is C2v because there's a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. So if E is NO2, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

If E is NO2, then reaction 2 would involve C and D reacting to form NO2. So D would be something that reacts with C to produce NO2.

Alternatively, if C is a nitro compound, and D is something that can release NO2 upon reaction.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 produces two acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). So perhaps F is HNO3 and G is H2SO3 or H3PO4.

If F is HNO3, that would suggest that C has nitrate groups. So maybe C is a nitrate salt, and when it reacts with water, it gives HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid.

But then, reaction 1: A + 8B → C (which is a nitrate salt). If C is a nitrate salt, perhaps A is a metal and B is a nitrate source, like nitric acid.

Wait, maybe B is NO3^- but that doesn't make sense as a gas. Alternatively, B could be O2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Given all this, I think the most plausible symmetry group is C2v if E is NO2, or D∞h if E is linear like HCN.

But since the options are given, and without more info, I'll have to make an educated guess. Given that NO2 is a common hazardous gas with C2v symmetry, and if E is NO2, the answer would be option D) C2v.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 8 B molecules per A atom, possibly forming a compound like a metal oxide or a coordination complex. The bright red color of C hints at a transition metal compound, such as a hexacyanoferrate(III) complex.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure. If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or HCN, it would have **D∞h** symmetry. If E is a bent molecule like SO₂ or NO₂, it would have **C2v** symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C could be a salt that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, it might produce HNO₃ (strong acid) and another weak acid like H₂SO₃.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B could combine to form a common solvent like water or methanol.

### Analysis of Symmetry Groups for E:
- **Option A (C2)**: This corresponds to a molecule with a two-fold rotational axis, such as H₂O₂. However, E is described as extremely hazardous, and H₂O₂ is not hazardous enough to match the description.
- **Option B (D₄h)**: This symmetry group is typical for square planar or certain coordination complexes. However, E is a product of C and D, and there is no evidence to suggest it forms a coordination complex.
- **Option C (D∞h)**: This is the symmetry group of linear molecules like O₂ or HCN. If E were O₂, it would not align with the description of being extremely hazardous. If E were HCN, it could fit, but there is no clear indication from the reactions.
- **Option D (C₂v)**: This symmetry group is typical for bent molecules like SO₂ or NO₂. NO₂, a red-brown gas, is extremely hazardous and aligns well with the description of E. Its bent structure with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes matches **C₂v** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the description of E as an extremely hazardous gas, the most plausible candidate for E is NO₂, which has **C₂v** symmetry.

Answer: D
