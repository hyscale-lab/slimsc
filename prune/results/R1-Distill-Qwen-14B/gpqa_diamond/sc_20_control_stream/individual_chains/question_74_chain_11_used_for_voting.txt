Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The decay probability depends on time. Let me see if I can apply that here.

The question says that the decay probability of an atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it's decayed. That means the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, because 100% minus 32% is 68%.

Wait, so if we model this with the exponential decay formula, the probability of decay is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Alternatively, the survival probability is P_survive(t) = e^(-λt).

But here, we know that P(100) = 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). That means e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -λ*100 = ln(0.68). Let me calculate ln(0.68). Oh wait, I remember that ln(0.68) is a negative number. Let me think, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and ln(0.68) should be around -0.385 or so. So λ would be 0.385 / 100, which is 0.00385 per minute. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without exact numbers.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, no. Wait, it's currently at 50 minutes, so the next 150 would be from 50 to 200 minutes. Wait, no, I think the question is: after 50 minutes have passed without decay, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time considered would be from 50 to 200 minutes, which is an additional 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the probability from now (50 minutes) to 200 minutes, which is 150 minutes. But that's not correct. Because the question says, "the next 150 minutes". So from time 50 to 200, which is 150 minutes.

But wait, no. Wait, the first part says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So now, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the remaining time is 150 minutes.

Wait, but another approach: the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes.

In radioactive decay, the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes would be the same as if it were just starting. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t0 minutes, is the same as the probability of decaying in t minutes from time zero. Because the exponential distribution is memoryless. So, if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Wait, but wait, that doesn't consider the fact that we've already had 50 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless, the remaining time doesn't depend on how long it's been. So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, regardless of when you start.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The standard formula for the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is P_survival(t) = e^(-λ t). So the probability that it decays between t1 and t2 (where t2 > t1) is P(t2) - P(t1).

In this problem, t1 is 50 minutes, t2 is 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200). So the probability is [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)].

Which simplifies to e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Alternatively, since λ is 0.00385 per minute (from earlier calculation), but perhaps I should find λ more accurately.

Wait, but earlier I found that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68, so λ = ln(1/0.68)/100. Let me compute that. ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (from 50 to 200) is e^(-λ * 50) - e^(-λ * 200).

Let me compute each term.

First, e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825.

Wait, let me compute e^(-0.19283). Hmm, e^(-0.2) is about 0.8187. 0.19283 is a little less than 0.2, so e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825.

Next, e^(-λ * 200) = e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.461.

So the probability is 0.825 - 0.461 = 0.364, which is about 36.4%. But that's not one of the options. The options are all in the 40s and 50s. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine my approach. Because this leads to an answer that's not in the options, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes from now (after 50 minutes). But wait, the way exponential decay works is that the probability of decay between t and t + Δt is λ * Δt, regardless of t. But that's only for a very small Δt. Oh, wait, no, that's the probability density function. The actual probability over a time interval is 1 - e^(-λ Δt), where Δt is the length of the interval.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the probability it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λ t). So the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λ t).

In this problem, the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [P(200) - P(50)] / (1 - P(50)). Because it's the probability of decaying between 50 and 200, given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)]] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

But since the atom hasn't decayed by 50, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, which is e^(-λ*50).

So the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Ah! That makes sense. Because the memoryless property means the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period starting from the current time.

So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So I should compute this.

We know that 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

We need to find λ and then compute 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Alternatively, since e^(-λ *100) = 0.68, we can write λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, λ *150 ≈ 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.5785.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561 (since e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488, so 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6). Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator for e^-0.5785:

Well, 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.

e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

Then, e^(-0.0785) ≈ 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.925.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0785) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.925 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 43.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 44%. So that's the closest.

Wait, but the initial approach I took gave me 36%, which isn't an option. But upon correcting the approach, I get 43.9%, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach to compute without calculating λ.

Because e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

We need to find e^(-λ *150) = e^(-λ *100) * e^(-λ *50) = 0.68 * e^(-λ *50).

But we don't know e^(-λ*50). Hmm.

Wait, another way: we know that e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

So λ = ln(1/0.68) / 100.

So, 150 minutes would be (150/100) times that time.

So e^(-λ *150) = (e^(-λ *100))^(150/100) = (0.68)^(3/2).

Compute 0.68^(3/2). Let's see, the square root of 0.68 is about 0.8246. Then 0.8246 * 0.68 ≈ 0.5615.

So 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, which is 43.85%, so approximately 44%, which is option A.

So the answer should be A) 44%.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is \( P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \), where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The survival probability is \( P_{\text{survive}}(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \).

### Step 1: Determine \( \lambda \)
From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:
\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}.
\]
Rearranging, we find:
\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68.
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68).
\]
Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we solve for \( \lambda \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this probability is equivalent to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval starting from the current time.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:
\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
\]
Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):
\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785.
\]
Thus:
\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561.
\]
Therefore:
\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Step 3: Verify using an alternative approach
We can also compute \( e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} \) using the fact that \( e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \). Since \( \lambda \cdot 150 = 1.5 \cdot \lambda \cdot 100 \), we have:
\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} = (e^{-\lambda \cdot 100})^{1.5} = (0.68)^{1.5}.
\]
The square root of \( 0.68 \) is approximately \( 0.8246 \), so:
\[
(0.68)^{1.5} = 0.8246 \cdot 0.68 \approx 0.561.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.

In this problem, t1 is 50 minutes, t2 is 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200). So the probability is [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)].

Which simplifies to e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Alternatively, since λ is 0.00385 per minute (from earlier calculation), but perhaps I should find λ more accurately.

Wait, but earlier I found that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68, so λ = ln(1/0.68)/100. Let me compute that. ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Let me compute each term.

First, e^(-λ *50) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825.

But since the atom hasn't decayed by 50, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, which is e^(-λ*50).

So the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Ah! That makes sense. Because the memoryless property means the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period starting from the current time.

So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561 (since e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488, so 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6). Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator for e^-0.5785:

Well, 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.

e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

Then, e^(-0.0785) ≈ 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.925.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0785) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.925 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 43.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 44%. So that's the closest.

Because e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

We need to find e^(-λ *150) = e^(-λ *100) * e^(-λ *50) = 0.68 * e^(-λ *50).

But we don't know e^(-λ*50). Hmm.

Wait, another way: we know that e^(-λ *100) = 0.68.

So λ = ln(1/0.68) / 100.

So, 150 minutes would be (150/100) times that time.

So e^(-λ *150) = (e^(-λ *100))^(150/100) = (0.68)^(3/2).

Compute 0.68^(3/2). Let's see, the square root of 0.68 is about 0.8246. Then 0.8246 * 0.68 ≈ 0.5615.

So 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, which is 43.85%, so approximately 44%, which is option A.

So the answer should be A) 44%.

### Step 1: Determine \( \lambda \)
From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:
\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}.
\]
Rearranging, we find:
\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68.
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[

\]
Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we solve for \( \lambda \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this probability is equivalent to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval starting from the current time.

The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:
\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
\]
Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):
\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785.
\]
Thus:
\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561.
\]
Therefore:
\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Step 3: Verify using an alternative approach
We can also compute \( e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} \) using the fact that \( e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \). Since \( \lambda \cdot 150 = 1.5 \cdot \lambda \cdot 100 \), we have:
\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 150} = (e^{-\lambda \cdot 100})^{1.5} = (0.68)^{1.5}.
\]
The square root of \( 0.68 \) is approximately \( 0.8246 \), so:
\[
(0.68)^{1.5} = 0.8246 \cdot 0.68 \approx 0.561.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.
