Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I think this has to do with complex ion formation. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is involved here. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is given by the formula:

Kf = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-])

Here, Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion, and CaY^2- is the calcium-EDTA complex.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. And we need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in the solution.

Since the EDTA is in excess, or under conditions where the complex is formed, the free Ca^2+ concentration would be really low because Kf is very large (5e10 is a big number), which means the reaction tends to go to completion.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric means that the concentrations are in the exact molar ratio needed for the reaction. So for every mole of EDTA, there's a mole of Ca^2+ that forms the complex.

So, the initial amount of EDTA and Ca^2+ would be the same, perhaps. But when they form the complex, the concentrations change.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But what about the free Ca^2+ and EDTA ions in solution? Because the complex dissociates a little. The Kf is given, so I can use it to find the concentrations.

I think the formula rearranged would be [Ca^2+][Y^4-] = [CaY^2-] / Kf.

But wait, since the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. Also, I can assume that the concentration of Y^4- is the same as the concentration of free EDTA, which is Y^4-.

Wait, but considering that the complex is formed, maybe the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But wait, if the solution is stoichiometric, I think that means that the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps we can model it as the initial setup where all the Ca^2+ has been complexed, and the free EDTA is some small amount.

Wait, but no, because the complex formation is reversible, so some of the complex will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial assumption is that [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of free Ca^2+ that comes from the dissociation.

Wait, but wait. Let me set up the problem more carefully.

The dissociation of the CaY^2- complex is:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf, which is 2e-11.

Wait, because Kf is [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]), so Kd = [Ca^2+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-] = 1/Kf.

Right, so Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as x. Then, the concentration of Y^4- would also be x, assuming that each dissociation releases one Ca^2+ and one Y^4-.

Wait, that's probably a valid assumption because the change is small. So:

At equilibrium,

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small, because Kd is small)

[Ca^2+] = x

[Y^4-] = x

So the dissociation expression would be Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Then x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Hmm, wait: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, but 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7.

So x = 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5). 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to match.

So the concentration of Ca^2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me go back and make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

So Kd = x² / [CaY^2-] = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 → 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So option C is the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Another way to approach this is using the formation constant. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]).

So Kf = 5e10 = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]).

Assuming that [Ca^2+] = [EDTA] = x, because each dissociation produces one of each.

So 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2) → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = 2e-6.5 → same as before.

Therefore, yes, the correct answer is C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is small). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) be \( x \). The dissociation expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Then x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Hmm, wait: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, but 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to match.

So the concentration of Ca^2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me go back and make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

So Kd = x² / [CaY^2-] = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 → 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7.

Therefore, yes, the correct answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is small). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) be \( x \). The dissociation expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
