Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the question says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They're saying that when only one hemisphere has spots, the photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating. This situation can look like an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, if there were no spots? So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. But in this case, the star has spots, so when the spots rotate into and out of view, it changes the observed brightness.

Wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variations due to spots can mimic a planet. So when the star is spotted, the light curve's amplitude is the same as if a planet were transiting. But since the question is asking, what planet size would produce the same as the actual spot effect, I think I need to calculate the amplitude from the spots and then equate that to the planet transit amplitude.

So first, I need to find the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, figure out what planet radius would cause the same variation.

Let me think about the star's luminosity. The star's total luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, they are cooler, so they contribute less light. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So the star has one hemisphere with 20% coverage of spots. So the total area with spots is 0.2 times half the star's surface.

Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. But wait, only one hemisphere is covered with spots. So the total area with spots is 0.2 * (π R²), because each hemisphere is half the surface area (2π R² for the whole sphere, so hemisphere is π R²). So the spotted area is 0.2 * π R².

Wait, no, wait. If the star's total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is π R². So if the filling factor is 20% (0.2), then the area of spots is 0.2 * π R².

Each spot is cooler, at 5000 K, because the star is 6000 K and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the flux from the spots is lower.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view. Wait, but since it's only one hemisphere that's spotted, the spots are on one side. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of our view.

Let me model this. The star's brightness when spots are on the side facing us will be lower. But the problem says that the spot coverage is causing a brightness variation that's similar to a planet transit. So the maximum dip in brightness due to the spots is when all the spotted regions are on the side facing us. But since the spots are only on one hemisphere, perhaps the rotation is such that the spot side (with spots) comes into view.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so if the spots are on one hemisphere, as it rotates, the spotted area comes into view and then goes away. So the brightness variation would be a dip as the spots become visible, then a rise as the spots are no longer visible.

But to find the amplitude, I need to calculate the change in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

So the total flux from the star without any spots is L = 4π R² σ Teff⁴.

But when the spots are visible, the total flux is less. The flux from the spots is (T_spot^4) * (area of spots) * σ, and the rest of the star's flux is (Teff^4) * (remaining area) * σ.

Wait, more precisely, the star's flux without spots is F0 = (σ Teff^4) * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ), but since we're considering relative changes, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change in flux.

Let me think in terms of relative flux.

The total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) = (σ Teff^4 R²) / D².

When spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (number of spots) * (flux per spot).

Wait no. Let me think of it as the sum of all spots and the rest of the star.

Each spot has an area A and a temperature T_spot. So the flux from one spot is A σ T_spot^4. The flux from the rest of the star is (4π R² - n*A) σ Teff^4, where n is the number of spots? No, wait. Alternatively, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So the area covered by spots is f * 4π R², where f is 0.2. But wait, the star has only one hemisphere with spots. So the total area with spots is f * 2π R².

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * π R².

Because the total surface area is 4π R², a hemisphere is 2π R², but wait no, a hemisphere is half of the sphere, so area is 2π R²? No, wait. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So a hemisphere would have 2π R², right?

Wait, no. Let's compute. Imagine a sphere: the total surface area is 4π R². So a hemisphere (half of the sphere) would have 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R², which is 0.4 π R².

So, the surface area of the star is 4π R². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the fractional area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, that's a different way of looking at it. Alternatively, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere, so 20% of 2π R² is 0.4π R². So the total spotted area is 0.4π R², which is 10% of the star's total surface area.

So the star's flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π R².

When the spotted area is facing us, the flux from the spots is F_spot = σ (Teff - 1000)^4 * 0.4 π R².

Wait, no. The spots are cooler, so T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So the flux from spots when they're facing us is F_spot = σ * T_spot^4 * (0.4 π R²).

The flux from the rest of the star is F_rest = σ Teff^4 * (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) ) ?

Wait, no. The total flux when the spots are visible is F = F_rest + F_spot.

Wait, no, the rest of the star's area is (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) = 3.6 π R². So the flux from the rest is σ Teff^4 * 3.6 π R².

So the total flux when spots are visible is F = (σ Teff^4 * 3.6 π R²) + (σ T_spot^4 * 0.4 π R²).

The flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4 π R².

The change in flux is ΔF = F0 - F = σ (Teff^4 * 4 π R²) - [Teff^4 *3.6 π R² + T_spot^4 *0.4 π R² ].

Simplify:

ΔF = σ [4 Teff^4 π R² - 3.6 Teff^4 π R² - 0.4 T_spot^4 π R² ]

= σ π R² [ (4 - 3.6) Teff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ]

= σ π R² [0.4 Teff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ]

= 0.4 σ π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

But wait, wait a second. That can't be right because T_spot is lower than Teff, so Teff^4 - T_spot^4 is positive, but the change in flux should be negative because when spots are visible, the flux goes down. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating F.

Wait, no. When spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F is less than F0. So ΔF would be negative. Let me compute F and F0 again.

F0 = σ Teff^4 *4 π R².

F = [ (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ Teff^4 ] + [ 0.4 π R² * σ T_spot^4 ]

= [3.6 π R² σ Teff^4 ] + [0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 ]

So F = σ π R² (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 )

ΔF = F0 - F = [4 Teff^4 - (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) ] * σ π R²

= [0.4 Teff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ] σ π R²

= 0.4 σ π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

Wait, okay, so ΔF is positive because Teff^4 > T_spot^4, but the flux is lower when spots are visible, so the change is negative. Hmm, perhaps I should have considered F - F0. Wait no, because F is lower than F0, so F0 - F is positive, and ΔF is negative when F is lower.

Wait, no, the flux when spots are visible is F, which is lower than F0. So the change in flux is F - F0. Wait, wait: when spots are visible, the flux is F. So the change from F0 (no spots) to F (spots visible) is F - F0, which is negative.

So the flux variation amplitude is |F - F0|.

So to find the fractional change, (F - F0)/F0.

So let's compute that.

(F - F0)/F0 = [ (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) - 4 Teff^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 )

= [ (3.6 Teff^4 -4 Teff^4 ) + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 )

= [ (-0.4 Teff^4) + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 )

= 0.4 (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / (4 Teff^4 )

= (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / (10 Teff^4 )

Wait, but wait, that would be a negative value, which makes sense because the flux is decreasing when spots are visible.

So the fractional change is (F - F0)/F0 = (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / (10 Teff^4 )

But since T_spot < Teff, this is negative. The magnitude of the change is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (10 Teff^4 )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux as (F - F0)/F0.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute Teff^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

T_spot^4 = 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So Teff^4 = 1.296e15, T_spot^4 = 6.25e14.

Compute the numerator: T_spot^4 - Teff^4 = 6.25e14 - 1.296e15 = -6.71e14.

So (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / (10 Teff^4 ) = (-6.71e14) / (10 * 1.296e15 )

Simplify denominator: 10 * 1.296e15 = 1.296e16.

So the fraction is (-6.71e14) / 1.296e16 = approximately -0.0518.

So the fractional change is about -5.18%, meaning a 5.18% decrease in flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, but wait a second. Because F is the flux when spots are visible. So when the spots rotate into view, the flux drops by about 5.18%, and when they rotate away, the flux returns to F0, meaning the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.18%.

Now, the question says that this situation (spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the planet would be the same as that from the spots.

In the case of a planet transiting the star, the planet blocks a part of the star's light, leading to a dip in flux. The amplitude of the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_planet^2, so the relative area is (π R_planet^2) / (π R_star^2 ) = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, but actually, the dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2).

So the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So if the dip caused by the planet is the same as the dip caused by the spots (5.18%), then:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 5.18% = 0.0518.

So R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, that's about 0.228. But the options given are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Hmm, none of the options are around 0.23. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me re-examine my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the fractional change. Let me go back.

Wait, when I calculated (F - F0)/F0, I think I might have miscalculated the factor.

Wait, another approach: the total flux change is due to the spots. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.2 (filling factor) times one hemisphere. Wait, wait, no. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, so the area is 0.2 * (π R²) = 0.2 * π R². Because the hemisphere's area is π R².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the fraction of the total surface covered by spots is (0.2 * π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.2 * 1/4 = 0.05, or 5% of the star's total surface.

Wait, that's a different approach. Oh! Because the spots are only on one hemisphere, which is half the star, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So 20% of 50% is 10% of the star's surface. Wait, no: wait, 20% of the hemisphere's area (which is half the star's surface) is 0.2 * (2π R²/2) (wait, no, the hemisphere's surface area is 2π R²? No, wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere (half of that) is 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, it's 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the area covered is 0.4π R², which is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface.

So the area of the spots is 10% of the star's surface area.

So when the spots are visible (i.e., when the spotted hemisphere is facing us), the flux from the spots is less than the flux from the rest of the star. So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F_rest + F_spots.

F_rest is the flux from the 90% of the star's surface not covered by spots, which is 0.9 * 4π R² * σ Teff^4 / (4π D²) ) → but again, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of relative flux.

So relative to the total flux, F0, when no spots are visible (but wait, the spots are on the back side when the other hemisphere is facing us?), but when the star is rotating, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is on the front. So in that case, the spotted area contributes less flux.

So the flux when spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot, where f is the filling factor of the star's surface (10% as we calculated).

So f = 0.1.

F_spot = (T_spot / Teff)^4 * F0 * f.

So F = (1 - f) F0 + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) F0.

So F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ].

The fractional change when spots are present is (F - F0) / F0.

Which is [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 ] 

= [ -f + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ] 

= f [ (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 ]

So the fractional change is f ( (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 )

But since T_spot is less than Teff, this will be negative, indicating a decrease in flux.

So the magnitude of the change is f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) )

So f = 0.1.

T_spot = 5000 K, Teff=6000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Compute 0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944; then squared again, 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So the fractional change is 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, or about 5.18% decrease in flux.

So the amplitude is about 5.18%.

So the planet would need to cause the same 5.18% decrease when it transits. So the planet's area relative to the star's area is 5.18%.

The planet's area is π R_planet², and the star's area is π R_star² (when considering the area blocked during transit). Wait, no. Wait, during a transit, the planet blocks a part of the star's disk, so the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2 of the star's area.

Wait, but the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

So setting (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.0518.

So R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, or approximately 0.228.

But our options don't have this. The options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire hemisphere's effect.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation differently. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, the brightness variation is due to the rotation. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower, and when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is higher.

Wait, no, the star emits uniformly from all areas when it's not spotted. But wait, the star's surface without spots is emitting at Teff in all areas. The spots are cooler, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the overall flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum fluxes.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_max.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_min.

So the variation in flux would be F_max - F_min.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

So F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so when a hemisphere is facing us, the other is not. But the star's total flux is the sum of all the flux from both hemispheres.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as being composed of two hemispheres: one with spots, one without.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (0.2 * (T_spot^4) + 0.8 * (Teff^4 )) * (hemisphere area) / (4π D²)

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Each hemisphere has an area of 2π R². The spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots, which are cooler. So area of spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². The rest of the hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux from that hemisphere is (1.6 π R² * sigma Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4 )

The other hemisphere is unspotted, so its flux is (2π R² * sigma Teff^4 )

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = [1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ] + 2 π R² Teff^4 

= (1.6 + 2 ) π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4

= 3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4

The total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (i.e., the spotted hemisphere is on the back side) is:

F_unspotted = 2π R² Teff^4 + 2π R² Teff^4 =4 π R² Teff^4.

Wait, no. When the star rotates and the spotted hemisphere is on the back, the front hemisphere is unspotted, so:

F_unspotted = 2 π R² Teff^4 + (the back hemisphere, which is the spotted one, but when it's behind, its flux is not seen). Wait, no, no, the star's total flux is the sum of all parts that are visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is behind, the front hemisphere (unspotted) contributes 2 π R² Teff^4, and the back hemisphere (spotted) contributes nothing because it's not visible.

Wait, wait no. The star is a sphere, so when we see it, we see all the light from the hemisphere facing us and none from the back. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front is spotted, and the flux is F_spotted as calculated. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = 2 π R² Teff^4.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted = 2 π R² Teff^4.

The minimum flux is F_spotted = (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) π R².

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted.

Compute F_unspotted = 2 π R² Teff^4.

F_spotted = (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) π R².

So F_unspotted - F_spotted = [2 Teff^4 - (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) ] π R².

= [ -1.6 Teff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ] π R².

Wait, that can't be right because F_unspotted is 2 Teff^4 π R², and F_spotted is (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) π R².

Wait, no. F_unspotted is 2 π R² Teff^4. F_spotted is (3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4).

So F_unspotted is 2 π R² Teff^4.

F_spotted is 3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² (5000)^4.

So the difference is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2 π R² Teff^4 - [3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² (5000)^4 ]

= [2 - 3.6] π R² Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² (5000)^4

= (-1.6 π R² Teff^4 ) - 0.4 π R² (5000)^4.

Wait, that's negative, but we're looking for the magnitude of the change. Hmm, perhaps I should compute the fractional change as (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted.

So:

(F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted = [ (2 - 3.6 ) Teff^4 - 0.4 (T_spot^4 ) ] / 2 

Divided by Teff^4, perhaps.

Wait, let's compute each part:

F_unspotted = 2 π R² Teff^4.

F_spotted = 3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

So the difference is:

F_unspotted - F_spotted = (2 π R² Teff^4 ) - (3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 )

= (2 -3.6 ) π R² Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

= (-1.6 π R² Teff^4 ) - 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

But this is negative, which doesn't make sense for a maximum and minimum. Wait, this suggests that F_spotted is larger than F_unspotted, which can't be right because spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is on the front side, the flux from that hemisphere is (area with spots) * T_spot^4 + (area without spots) * Teff^4.

So the front hemisphere's flux is:

(0.4 π R²) (T_spot^4 ) + (1.6 π R² ) (Teff^4 )

The back hemisphere is the unspotted one, and since it's behind, we don't see it. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = (0.4 π R² T_spot^4 + 1.6 π R² Teff^4 )

= π R² (0.4 T_spot^4 + 1.6 Teff^4 ).

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotted = 2 π R² Teff^4.

So F_unspotted is larger than F_spotted, which makes sense.

So the amplitude is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2 π R² Teff^4 - [ π R² (0.4 T_spot^4 + 1.6 Teff^4 ) ]

= 2 π R² Teff^4 - π R² (0.4 T_spot^4 + 1.6 Teff^4 )

= [2 Teff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 - 1.6 Teff^4 ] π R².

= (0.4 Teff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ) π R².

So F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The fractional change is (0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) π R² ) / (2 π R² Teff^4 )

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (2 Teff^4 )

= [0.4 ( (6000^4) - (5000^4) ) ] / (2 * 6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Divide by 2 * 1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So 2.684e14 / 2.592e15 ≈ 0.1035.

So the fractional change is about 10.35%.

Wait, so the amplitude is approximately 10.35% change in flux.

So the planet would need to cause the same 10.35% dip.

So (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.1035.

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the flux changes caused by the spots and equate them to the flux change caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots: Cover 20% of one hemisphere, with a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (1000 K cooler).

2. **Filling Factor**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The area of the spotted region is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), which is 10% of the star's total surface area.

3. **Flux Variation**:
   - The total flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \times 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \sigma \left( 3.6 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right) \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4) = 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 6.71 \times 10^{14}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \times 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{2 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(10.35% decrease)}.
     \]

4. **Planet Transit**:
   - The fractional dip in flux during a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217 \, \text{(approximately 0.32)}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This matches option **D**.
