Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. We have three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants. The results show different resistances when these genes are knocked out or when they're in double mutants.

First, I remember that when a gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, knocking it out would disable the regulation of downstream genes. So, if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes might not be expressed, leading to more severe phenotypes.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild-type (100%) but not super bad.
- g2: 0% resistance. That's really bad; the plants are completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. So, halfway between wild-type and susceptible.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant.
  - g2g3: 0% same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% same as g2.

Hmm. So, the double mutants involving g2 are as bad as g2 alone. But the double mutant of g1g3 is worse than either alone.

I think this has to do with gene interactions, maybe epistasis. Remember, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then any mutations downstream would only show effects if the upstream gene is working. Wait, maybe the opposite: if G2 is upstream, and it's knocked out, then any downstream genes (like G1 or G3) wouldn't matter because their products aren't made. But in this case, g2 alone has 0% resistance. So, it's a transcription factor, perhaps, that activates other genes which contribute to resistance.

Looking at the options, most of them suggest G2 is the transcription factor. Let's see the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. But in the data, g1 has 75% which is not 0, so G1 might not be the TF. Because if G1 is upstream, then knocking it out would disable other genes, leading to lower resistance, but maybe not as severe as 0. Hmm, but G2 is worse, so maybe G2 is upstream.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the effect is additive, but I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic towards G3. Not sure about pleiotropy yet.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Redundancy would mean they have similar functions, so knocking out both makes the effect worse.

So, let's think about what each mutant implies.

g2 has 0% resistance, which is the worst. So, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance. Without G2, the other genes aren't expressed, hence no resistance. But then why does g1 have 75%? Because maybe G1 is downstream of G2, but G1's product isn't the only way. Or perhaps G1's function isn't entirely dependent on G2.

Wait, in the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. That suggests that in the absence of G2, G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is knocked out, G1 can't function. But when G2 is present (i.e., in g1), G1 contributes to resistance. So G1 may be downstream of G2.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G3's function is only relevant if G2 is present. So G3 is downstream of G2.

Now, what about the other double mutant, g1g3. Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. g1 alone is 75%, g3 alone is 50%. So combining g1 and g3 gives a lower resistance. Maybe they function in parallel pathways. Or perhaps they are part of the same pathway but not dependent on each other.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, then knocking out G2 would disable both, which is what g2 shows (0%). But in double mutants where only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, the effect is less severe. So, G1 and G3 might contribute to resistance, but perhaps they are part of separate pathways.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So maybe when both are missing, the plant is more susceptible than when only one is missing.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have additive effects. So, each contributes some resistance, but when both are missing, the effect is additive.

But let's think about the epistatic relationships. Epistasis is about the order in which genes act. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation masks the effect of gene B's mutation.

In the case of g1g3, their combined effect is worse than either. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their effects are additive. Alternatively, they might be in parallel pathways. But the data suggests that when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single, implying that each contributes something.

Wait, but I'm trying to connect this with the options. Let's look at the options again.

Option A says G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic. But if G2's resistance is 0, and it's a TF, that fits better. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Option C says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I think here, perhaps they're acting in the same pathway. Or maybe they have different functions but both contribute to resistance.

Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than knocking out either alone. That's what we see in g1g3: 10% is worse than 75% and 50%.

So, redundancy would mean G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. So, the double mutant is worse than either mutant alone. So in that case, the resistance would be lower than the lowest of the two single mutants. Wait, because g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so the double would be, say, worse than 50%. Here, it's 10%, which is worse than 50%. So that could fit redundancy.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their function is overlapping, so each can compensate for the other. When both are knocked out, there's no redundancy, so the effect is worse.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then each contributes to resistance. So, in the single mutants, each is missing one, but the other can compensate a bit. Only when both are gone does the resistance drop a lot.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps with redundant functions.

Now, looking at the options, option D says G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 show redundancy, with G1 epistatic to G3.

What does epistatic mean here? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1's mutation masks the effect of G3. But I'm not sure how that ties in.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic, that might mean that G1 acts downstream of G3. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, in terms of epistasis, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G1 mutation determines the outcome regardless of G3's mutation. So when both are mutated, the effect is the same as G1 being mutated.

But in the data, when both are mutated, the phenotype is worse than either. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: if G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed (or not functional), leading to 0% resistance. But when either G1 or G3 is knocked out in the presence of G2 (g1 or g3), the other gene can still contribute some resistance. So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

In that case, knocking out both (g1g3) would lead to a bigger decrease than either alone. So, perhaps their functions are additive.

But how does that fit into the options? Let's check the options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That would mean they are in the same pathway, and each can compensate for the other. So, if you knock out just one, the other can take over, but knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype. That matches the g1g3 data.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is the TF upstream, then the double mutant would have additive effects beyond each single mutant.

Now, the epistatic part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that might mean that G1's function is upstream of G3's, or vice versa.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse, which suggests they are additive. So, perhaps each contributes independently to resistance.

Looking at the options: option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either, so maybe G1 is not epistatic but additive. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but contribute different amounts. So, G1's function is more significant than G3's.

Another angle: if G2 is the transcription factor, then G1 and G3 are downstream. So knocking out G2 inactivates both, resulting in no resistance (g2: 0%). For the single mutants, g1 and g3, each is missing one downstream gene. Since they have 75% and 50% respectively, it suggests that G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, both downstream genes are missing, leading to a more severe phenotype than either single (10% vs 75% and 50%). So, the double mutant is worse, which aligns with redundancy because if both are redundant, their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

But why is the double mutant worse than both? Because each single mutation only removes one gene, so the other can compensate a bit. But when both are gone, there's no redundancy, so the effect is more pronounced.

So, this would suggest that G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways. So, the answer should involve G2 as the TF, and G1 and G3 being redundant.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but how does epistasis fit here?

Epistasis is about the order of genes in a pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, it might mean that G1 acts downstream. Because the epistatic gene's mutation masks the effect of the other gene's mutation.

Wait, let's think about the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So, without either, the resistance is lower than when only one is missing.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1's mutation would determine the phenotype, regardless of G3's mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway is: G2 activates G1 and G3. If G1 is a transcription factor for another set of genes, and G3 is another factor. So, G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 and act in parallel pathways.

In that case, knocking out G1 would disable that pathway, but G3's pathway remains. So, g1 would have 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. Maybe G1's pathway is stronger.

Then, in the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are gone, leading to the worst resistance (10%).

So, this would imply that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. Their functions are additive, so knocking both out leads to the sum of their individual effects being lost.

But how does this tie into the question of epistasis?

Wait, maybe G1 is epistatic to G3. That would mean that the function of G1 is downstream of G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, the pathway can't proceed regardless of G3's state.

But in this case, the data doesn't directly show that. Because in the double mutant of g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. If G1 were epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same resistance as g1, because G1's mutation would mask G3's.

But in reality, the double mutant is worse than g1, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the epistasis part. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that when G1 is mutated, the effect of G3's mutation doesn't matter. So, in the double mutant, the effect would be the same as G1 being mutated (g1:75%). But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is about the order of the genes in a pathway. Let's imagine a pathway where G2 activates G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes.

If G2 is upstream, then knocking it out would disable both G1 and G3, leading to 0% resistance (g2:0%).

If G1 is downstream of G2, then g1 would have some residual resistance because G3 is still active. Similarly, g3 would have some resistance because G1 is active.

In the double mutant g1g3, neither gene is active, so resistance is worse (10%).

In this case, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both activated by G2. So each contributes to resistance, but not entirely dependent on each other.

But the data shows that the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either single. So, their contributions are additive.

So, which option fits this scenario?

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But in this case, redundancy would mean that each can do the same function. So, knocking out both would have a worse effect than either alone. That's what we see in the data.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, their double mutant would be worse than either single. That fits.

So, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant. Now, what about the epistatic part in option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the phenotype of G1's mutation determines the outcome regardless of G3's mutation. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as g1 (75%) because G1's mutation is upstream. But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So, that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic.

Hmm. So maybe the epistatic part is not correct. Let's think again.

Alternative possibility: the presence of G2 is required for G1 and G3 to function. So, without G2, both are non-functional. So, G2 is upstream of both.

In the case of double mutants, like g1g3, since G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But in the single mutants, only one is knocked out, so the other can compensate if there's redundancy.

Wait, but if G2 is working, then in single mutants, the other gene is active. So, in g1, G3 is active. So, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. That suggests that G1 contributes more than G3.

In the double mutant, both are knocked out, so resistance is 10%, much worse.

So, this scenario fits gene redundancy because each gene can compensate for the other when only one is knocked out.

So, the correct statement would be that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and their double mutant has a worse phenotype than either single.

Looking at the options, option D says this, except for the epistatic part. But let's see the option again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that when G1 is mutated, the effect of G3's mutation doesn't matter. So, in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1. But in reality, it's worse.

So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect in option D.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach. Let's see the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Or maybe it refers to their roles in different pathways.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and have pleiotropic effects beyond just resistance.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the epistatic relations again.

Another approach: The presence of G2 in the pathway might affect the epistatic relationships.

When G2 is present:

- Knocking out G1: the pathway through G1 is blocked, but G3's pathway continues.
- Knocking out G3: the pathway through G3 is blocked, but G1's pathway continues.

In the double mutant, both pathways are blocked, leading to the worst resistance.

So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance, each being downstream of G2.

In this case, each gene's mutation leads to a partial loss of function, and the double mutant a more severe loss.

So, their functions are additive. Thus, knocking out both leads to more severe disease susceptibility.

Which suggests that their functions are not redundant but additive, and they are in parallel pathways.

But the options don't have that description. Let's look again.

Option A: G1 is TF, but data suggests G2 is worse, so perhaps G2 is the TF.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show redundancy, which would mean their functions are similar. So, knocking both would be worse.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but why is G1 epistatic towards G3 in option D? Because if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant would be same as G1, which is 75%, but the data says 10%. So perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the epistatic part in the options. Let's think about the term 'epistatic towards'. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1's mutation is epistatic to G3's. So, the effect of G3's mutation is masked when G1 is also mutated.

But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either single, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to the order of the genes in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, perhaps G1 is downstream, and G3 is upstream. So, if G3 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked, regardless of G1's status. But that doesn't fit the data.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to rule out options.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, perhaps. But if G1 and G3 are co-regulated, then knocking out G2 would knock out both. So, why are their single mutants different? Because g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%—so their expression might not be entirely dependent on the same promoter.

So, option B probably isn't correct.

Option A: G1 is TF, which doesn't fit because g2 is worse.

So, between options C and D.

Let me read the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean each gene affects multiple traits, but I don't think that's the case here—they all relate to the same trait (resistance).

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would explain why the double mutant is worse than either single. But then why is the epistatic part there?

Wait, maybe 'G1 is epistatic towards G3' refers to redundancy. Because if G1 is redundant with G3, then G1's mutation would mask the effect of G3's mutation. But in the data, the double mutant is worse, which contradicts that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic' in the option is incorrect, but the rest of the option is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the fact that g1g2 is 0% (same as g2) suggests that G1 is downstream of G2. So, when G2 is mutated, G1 doesn't matter. So, G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, meaning G3 is also downstream of G2.

So, G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are both downstream, perhaps in parallel pathways.

Each contributes to resistance, so knocking out both would lead to the lowest resistance.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

In terms of the options, this would align with option D, which says gene redundancy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, redundancy implies that the genes have the same function, so each can take over for the other. So, if you knock out one, the other can compensate. But if you knock out both, there’s no compensation, leading to a worse phenotype.

In the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So, the single mutants are each worse than wild-type, but not as bad as the double. So, 10% is worse than both.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 have additive effects, but their redundancy is partial. Or perhaps they function in parallel, each contributing to resistance, but not completely overlapping.

In that case, the double mutant would have a combined effect, which is additive. But I'm not sure if that's exactly redundancy.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'gene redundancy' in the options refers to both genes contributing to the same process, but not necessarily being identical.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the double mutant would be worse than either single. That's what the data shows.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not entirely clear on why G1 is epistatic towards G3. Because in the data, the double mutant is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps 'G1 is epistatic towards G3' in this context refers to the fact that G1's mutation in the presence of G3's mutation leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part is not the key point, and the more important thing is that G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants, and the goal is to determine the relationship between these genes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild-type but not as severe as g2).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, suggesting G2 is critical).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate susceptibility).

2. **Double mutants**:
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

### Analysis:
- **Role of G2**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0% resistance) suggests that G2 is likely a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes, as its absence disables resistance pathways.
- **Role of G1 and G3**: The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) indicate that both genes contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) shows that their combined loss results in a phenotype worse than either single mutant, suggesting they are functionally related but not fully redundant.
- **Epistasis**: The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) both result in 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can compensate for the loss of resistance.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It suggests G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the most critical gene, as g2 has 0% resistance.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 share the same promoter, but their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3), contradicting this.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the term "pleiotropy" does not fit the data, as G1 and G3 appear to contribute similarly to resistance rather than affecting multiple unrelated traits.
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, as their combined loss results in a worse phenotype than either single mutant. The statement "G1 is epistatic towards G3" aligns with the observation that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3's mutation in the double mutant.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent explanation is that G2 is the transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, which are redundant genes contributing to resistance. Their combined loss in the double mutant leads to a more severe phenotype than either single mutant.

**Answer: D**

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. We have three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants. The results show different resistances when these genes are knocked out or when they're in double mutants.

First, I remember that when a gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, knocking it out would disable the regulation of downstream genes. So, if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes might not be expressed, leading to more severe phenotypes.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild-type (100%) but not super bad.
- g2: 0% resistance. That's really bad; the plants are completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. So, halfway between wild-type and susceptible.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant.
  - g2g3: 0% same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% same as g2.

Hmm. So, the double mutants involving g2 are as bad as g2 alone. But the double mutant of g1g3 is worse than either alone.

I think this has to do with gene interactions, maybe epistasis. Remember, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then any mutations downstream would only show effects if the upstream gene is working. Wait, maybe the opposite: if G2 is upstream, and it's knocked out, then any downstream genes (like G1 or G3) wouldn't matter because their products aren't made. But in this case, g2 alone has 0% resistance. So, it's a transcription factor, perhaps, that activates other genes which contribute to resistance.

Looking at the options, most of them suggest G2 is the transcription factor. Let's see the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. But in the data, g1 has 75% which is not 0, so G1 might not be the TF. Because if G1 is upstream, then knocking it out would disable other genes, leading to lower resistance, but maybe not as severe as 0. Hmm, but G2 is worse, so maybe G2 is upstream.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the effect is additive, but I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic towards G3. Not sure about pleiotropy yet.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Redundancy would mean they have similar functions, so knocking out both makes the effect worse.

So, let's think about what each mutant implies.

g2 has 0% resistance, which is the worst. So, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance. Without G2, the other genes aren't expressed, hence no resistance. But then why does g1 have 75%? Because maybe G1 is downstream of G2, but G1's product isn't the only way. Or perhaps G1's function isn't entirely dependent on G2.

Wait, in the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. That suggests that in the absence of G2, G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is knocked out, G1 can't function. But when G2 is present (i.e., in g1), G1 contributes to resistance. So G1 may be downstream of G2.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G3's function is only relevant if G2 is present. So G3 is downstream of G2.

Now, what about the other double mutant, g1g3. Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. g1 alone is 75%, g3 alone is 50%. So combining g1 and g3 gives a lower resistance. Maybe they function in parallel pathways. Or perhaps they are part of the same pathway but not dependent on each other.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, then knocking out G2 would disable both, which is what g2 shows (0%). But in double mutants where only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, the effect is less severe. So, G1 and G3 might contribute to resistance, but perhaps they are part of separate pathways.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So maybe when both are missing, the plant is more susceptible than when only one is missing.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have additive effects. So, each contributes some resistance, but when both are missing, the effect is additive.

But let's think about the epistatic relationships. Epistasis is about the order in which genes act. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation masks the effect of gene B's mutation.

In the case of g1g3, their combined effect is worse than either. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their effects are additive. Alternatively, they might be in parallel pathways. But the data suggests that when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single, implying that each contributes something.

Wait, but I'm trying to connect this with the options. Let's look at the options again.

Option A says G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic. But if G2's resistance is 0, and it's a TF, that fits better. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Option C says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I think here, perhaps they're acting in the same pathway. Or maybe they have different functions but both contribute to resistance.

Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than knocking out either alone. That's what we see in g1g3: 10% is worse than 75% and 50%.

So, redundancy would mean G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. So, the double mutant is worse than either mutant alone. So in that case, the resistance would be lower than the lowest of the two single mutants. Wait, because g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so the double would be, say, worse than 50%. Here, it's 10%, which is worse than 50%. So that could fit redundancy.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their function is overlapping, so each can compensate for the other. When both are knocked out, there's no redundancy, so the effect is worse.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then each contributes to resistance. So, in the single mutants, each is missing one, but the other can compensate a bit. Only when both are gone does the resistance drop a lot.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps with redundant functions.

Now, looking at the options, option D says G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 show redundancy, with G1 epistatic to G3.

What does epistatic mean here? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1's mutation masks the effect of G3. But I'm not sure how that ties in.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic, that might mean that G1 acts downstream of G3. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, in terms of epistasis, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of G1 mutation determines the outcome regardless of G3's mutation. So when both are mutated, the effect is the same as G1 being mutated.

But in the data, when both are mutated, the phenotype is worse than either. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: if G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed (or not functional), leading to 0% resistance. But when either G1 or G3 is knocked out in the presence of G2 (g1 or g3), the other gene can still contribute some resistance. So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

In that case, knocking out both (g1g3) would lead to a bigger decrease than either alone. So, perhaps their functions are additive.

But how does that fit into the options? Let's check the options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That would mean they are in the same pathway, and each can compensate for the other. So, if you knock out just one, the other can take over, but knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype. That matches the g1g3 data.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is the TF upstream, then the double mutant would have additive effects beyond each single mutant.

Now, the epistatic part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that might mean that G1's function is upstream of G3's, or vice versa.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse, which suggests they are additive. So, perhaps each contributes independently to resistance.

Looking at the options: option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either, so maybe G1 is not epistatic but additive. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but contribute different amounts. So, G1's function is more significant than G3's.

Another angle: if G2 is the transcription factor, then G1 and G3 are downstream. So knocking out G2 inactivates both, resulting in no resistance (g2: 0%). For the single mutants, g1 and g3, each is missing one downstream gene. Since they have 75% and 50% respectively, it suggests that G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, both downstream genes are missing, leading to a more severe phenotype than either single (10% vs 75% and 50%). So, the double mutant is worse, which aligns with redundancy because if both are redundant, their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

But why is the double mutant worse than both? Because each single mutation only removes one gene, so the other can compensate a bit. But when both are gone, there's no redundancy, so the effect is more pronounced.

So, this would suggest that G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways. So, the answer should involve G2 as the TF, and G1 and G3 being redundant.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but how does epistasis fit here?

Epistasis is about the order of genes in a pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, it might mean that G1 acts downstream. Because the epistatic gene's mutation masks the effect of the other gene's mutation.

Wait, let's think about the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So, without either, the resistance is lower than when only one is missing.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1's mutation would determine the phenotype, regardless of G3's mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway is: G2 activates G1 and G3. If G1 is a transcription factor for another set of genes, and G3 is another factor. So, G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 and act in parallel pathways.

In that case, knocking out G1 would disable that pathway, but G3's pathway remains. So, g1 would have 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. Maybe G1's pathway is stronger.

Then, in the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are gone, leading to the worst resistance (10%).

So, this would imply that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. Their functions are additive, so knocking both out leads to the sum of their individual effects being lost.

But how does this tie into the question of epistasis?

Wait, maybe G1 is epistatic to G3. That would mean that the function of G1 is downstream of G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, the pathway can't proceed regardless of G3's state.

But in this case, the data doesn't directly show that. Because in the double mutant of g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. If G1 were epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same resistance as g1, because G1's mutation would mask G3's.

But in reality, the double mutant is worse than g1, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the epistasis part. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that when G1 is mutated, the effect of G3's mutation doesn't matter. So, in the double mutant, the effect would be the same as G1 being mutated (g1:75%). But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is about the order of the genes in a pathway. Let's imagine a pathway where G2 activates G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes.

If G2 is upstream, then knocking it out would disable both G1 and G3, leading to 0% resistance (g2:0%).

If G1 is downstream of G2, then g1 would have some residual resistance because G3 is still active. Similarly, g3 would have some resistance because G1 is active.

In the double mutant g1g3, neither gene is active, so resistance is worse (10%).

In this case, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both activated by G2. So each contributes to resistance, but not entirely dependent on each other.

But the data shows that the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either single. So, their contributions are additive.

So, which option fits this scenario?

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But in this case, redundancy would mean that each can do the same function. So, knocking out both would have a worse effect than either alone. That's what we see in the data.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, their double mutant would be worse than either single. That fits.

So, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant. Now, what about the epistatic part in option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the phenotype of G1's mutation determines the outcome regardless of G3's mutation. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as g1 (75%) because G1's mutation is upstream. But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So, that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic.

Hmm. So maybe the epistatic part is not correct. Let's think again.

Alternative possibility: the presence of G2 is required for G1 and G3 to function. So, without G2, both are non-functional. So, G2 is upstream of both.

In the case of double mutants, like g1g3, since G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But in the single mutants, only one is knocked out, so the other can compensate if there's redundancy.

Wait, but if G2 is working, then in single mutants, the other gene is active. So, in g1, G3 is active. So, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. That suggests that G1 contributes more than G3.

In the double mutant, both are knocked out, so resistance is 10%, much worse.

So, this scenario fits gene redundancy because each gene can compensate for the other when only one is knocked out.

So, the correct statement would be that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and their double mutant has a worse phenotype than either single.

Looking at the options, option D says this, except for the epistatic part. But let's see the option again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that when G1 is mutated, the effect of G3's mutation doesn't matter. So, in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1. But in reality, it's worse.

So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect in option D.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach. Let's see the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Or maybe it refers to their roles in different pathways.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and have pleiotropic effects beyond just resistance.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the epistatic relations again.

Another approach: The presence of G2 in the pathway might affect the epistatic relationships.

When G2 is present:

- Knocking out G1: the pathway through G1 is blocked, but G3's pathway continues.
- Knocking out G3: the pathway through G3 is blocked, but G1's pathway continues.

In the double mutant, both pathways are blocked, leading to the worst resistance.

So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance, each being downstream of G2.

In this case, each gene's mutation leads to a partial loss of function, and the double mutant a more severe loss.

So, their functions are additive. Thus, knocking out both leads to more severe disease susceptibility.

Which suggests that their functions are not redundant but additive, and they are in parallel pathways.

But the options don't have that description. Let's look again.

Option A: G1 is TF, but data suggests G2 is worse, so perhaps G2 is the TF.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show redundancy, which would mean their functions are similar. So, knocking both would be worse.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but why is G1 epistatic towards G3 in option D? Because if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant would be same as G1, which is 75%, but the data says 10%. So perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the epistatic part in the options. Let's think about the term 'epistatic towards'. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1's mutation is epistatic to G3's. So, the effect of G3's mutation is masked when G1 is also mutated.

But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either single, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to the order of the genes in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, perhaps G1 is downstream, and G3 is upstream. So, if G3 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked, regardless of G1's status. But that doesn't fit the data.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to rule out options.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, perhaps. But if G1 and G3 are co-regulated, then knocking out G2 would knock out both. So, why are their single mutants different? Because g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%—so their expression might not be entirely dependent on the same promoter.

So, option B probably isn't correct.

Option A: G1 is TF, which doesn't fit because g2 is worse.

So, between options C and D.

Let me read the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean each gene affects multiple traits, but I don't think that's the case here—they all relate to the same trait (resistance).

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would explain why the double mutant is worse than either single. But then why is the epistatic part there?

Wait, maybe 'G1 is epistatic towards G3' refers to redundancy. Because if G1 is redundant with G3, then G1's mutation would mask the effect of G3's mutation. But in the data, the double mutant is worse, which contradicts that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic' in the option is incorrect, but the rest of the option is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the fact that g1g2 is 0% (same as g2) suggests that G1 is downstream of G2. So, when G2 is mutated, G1 doesn't matter. So, G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, meaning G3 is also downstream of G2.

So, G2 is the TF upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are both downstream, perhaps in parallel pathways.

Each contributes to resistance, so knocking out both would lead to the lowest resistance.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

In terms of the options, this would align with option D, which says gene redundancy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, redundancy implies that the genes have the same function, so each can take over for the other. So, if you knock out one, the other can compensate. But if you knock out both, there’s no compensation, leading to a worse phenotype.

In the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So, the single mutants are each worse than wild-type, but not as bad as the double. So, 10% is worse than both.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 have additive effects, but their redundancy is partial. Or perhaps they function in parallel, each contributing to resistance, but not completely overlapping.

In that case, the double mutant would have a combined effect, which is additive. But I'm not sure if that's exactly redundancy.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'gene redundancy' in the options refers to both genes contributing to the same process, but not necessarily being identical.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the double mutant would be worse than either single. That's what the data shows.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not entirely clear on why G1 is epistatic towards G3. Because in the data, the double mutant is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps 'G1 is epistatic towards G3' in this context refers to the fact that G1's mutation in the presence of G3's mutation leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part is not the key point, and the more important thing is that G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option D.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants, and the goal is to determine the relationship between these genes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild-type but not as severe as g2).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, suggesting G2 is critical).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate susceptibility).

2. **Double mutants**:
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

### Analysis:
- **Role of G2**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0% resistance) suggests that G2 is likely a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes, as its absence disables resistance pathways.
- **Role of G1 and G3**: The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) indicate that both genes contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) shows that their combined loss results in a phenotype worse than either single mutant, suggesting they are functionally related but not fully redundant.
- **Epistasis**: The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) both result in 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can compensate for the loss of resistance.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It suggests G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the most critical gene, as g2 has 0% resistance.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 share the same promoter, but their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3), contradicting this.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the term "pleiotropy" does not fit the data, as G1 and G3 appear to contribute similarly to resistance rather than affecting multiple unrelated traits.
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, as their combined loss results in a worse phenotype than either single mutant. The statement "G1 is epistatic towards G3" aligns with the observation that G1's mutation masks the effect of G3's mutation in the double mutant.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent explanation is that G2 is the transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, which are redundant genes contributing to resistance. Their combined loss in the double mutant leads to a more severe phenotype than either single mutant.

**Answer: D**
