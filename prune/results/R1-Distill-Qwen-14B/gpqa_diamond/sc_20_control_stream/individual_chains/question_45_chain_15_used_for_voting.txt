Okay, so I'm trying to answer this quantum mechanics question about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let me think. The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite well of length L. I need to find the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the question defines E as E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each energy level can only hold a certain number of particles. Spin-1/2 particles have spin up and down, so each spatial state can hold two particles.

So the setup is that we have four particles, all spin-1/2, so two each in each spatial state possible. But wait, let me think again. Each energy level (each n) can hold up to two particles because of the spin states. So for each n, you can have two particles, one with spin up and one down.

So the ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration. Since each spatial state can hold two, let's see how the particles fill up the states.

In the ground state, we start filling the lowest n first. So n=1 can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down), n=2 can hold two more. But wait, we have four particles total. So ground state would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=2? Or maybe n=1 holds two, and the next two go into higher n?

Wait, no, maybe I'm thinking about electrons in an atom. Oh wait, in this case, in a 1D box, each energy level is non-degenerate because of the spatial part. So the spatial wavefunction is non-degenerate, so each n corresponds to a single state, but because the particles are spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down, so two particles per spatial state.

So for four particles, the first two (n=1) fill up with spin up and down, then the next two would go into n=2, each with spin up and down. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. Each in n=1 contributes E_1 = (1²)E = E. Each in n=2 contributes E_2 = (2²)E =4E. So two each: 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, that would make the ground state energy 10E? Hmm, but wait, maybe that's the case. Wait, no, no—because each particle in n=1 contributes E, there are two particles there, so 2*E. Similarly, two particles in n=2, so 2*4E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the ground state would be the lowest possible, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy possible configuration. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins). The next two go into n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E=10E. Wait, but in that case, the ground state energy would be 10E. But looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 50E. Hmm, that can't be right because 10E is the first excited state then. Wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the states. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the particles fill up the states. Let's think step by step.

Each spatial state (n) can hold up to 2 particles (spin up and down). So for four identical particles, how are they arranged?

Ground state (lowest energy): n=1 can hold two particles (spins up and down). Then n=2 can hold two particles. So the four particles would occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E. So sum is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. Wait, but the options don't have ground state as 10E. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E, 50E

C)4E, 10E, 15E

D)10E, 15E, 18E

Wait, option D's ground state is 10E. So if the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's, but perhaps in some other arrangement. Or perhaps I'm forgetting that the particles are fermions and their wavefunctions must be anti-symmetric. But in a 1D box, the spatial part is non-degenerate, so each n is a single state, and the spin part would determine the overall symmetry.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of filling the states based on their energy levels. For four particles:

- First, n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down), so two particles here.

- Next, n=2 can hold another 2, so four in total. So the total energy is 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state would be 10E.

But looking at the options, option D has ground state as 10E, and first excited as 15E, second as 18E. But wait, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n, and the excited states have higher n particles.

Wait, but let me think about the first excited state. The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible n's, which would be n=1 and n=2 with two each.

What's the first excited state? The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to the next higher energy level, but wait, no, that's not possible because each n is filled with two particles before moving to the next.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would involve moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. But how?

Wait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake here. For four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The next possible state (first excited) would have one particle promoted to a higher n. But can that happen? Because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state has two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but then that may not be the case. Because the way the states are filled is based on the Pauli exclusion. So when you have four particles, the first two go to n=1 (spin up and down), the next two go to n=2, same spin. So the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2, energy 10E.

Then, the first excited state would involve moving a particle from n=2 to the next available n, which is n=3. So now you have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 1*(2²E) + 1*(3²E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, so now 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E=20E. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the second excited state. Alternatively, perhaps the next state after first excited is different.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? But wait, n=1 can only hold two particles because of spin, so that's not possible. So that can't happen.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each particle can have their own n, but with spin considered. So each spatial state can hold two particles. Let me list the possible fillings:

Ground state:
n=1: 2 particles (spins up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spins up and down)
Total energy: 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state:
Maybe one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. So n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. So the energy is 2*1E +1*(4E) +1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: Now, the next possible configuration. Maybe another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So energy is 2*1E +0 + 2*9E= 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E as the second excited state. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 30E, 39E,50E.

Option B:4,10,50.

Option C:4,10,15.

Option D:10,15,18.

Wait, none of the options have 20E. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the states are filled.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spin affects the multiplicity, but in a 1D box, each n is a single state. So when you have spin-1/2, you can have two particles per n.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same spatial state, but that's impossible because of the Pauli exclusion. So no, each n can only have two. So for four particles, it's n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), as before.

So ground state energy is 10E. Then the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so you have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Energy 2*E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when two particles are in n=3, so n=1:2, n=3:2. So energy is 2E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state after 15E is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=2 can't have any more particles because it's already at one after the first excited state. Wait, no. Wait, n=2 can have up to two particles. So in the first excited state, n=2 has one, but in the ground state it had two. So perhaps the first excited state could be when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but then you have n=2 with one and n=3 with one. Then, the next step would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making n=2 have zero and n=3 have two.

So the energies:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are E= n² E0, where E0 is the base unit (E0 = E as given).

Now, for four particles, each spatial state can take two, so:

n=1: 2 particles → 2*(1²) E0 = 2E0.

n=2: 2 particles → 2*(4) E0 = 8E0.

Total energy: 10E0. So ground state is 10E0.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says ground state is 10E, which lines up. Then, first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3. So n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. So the energy is 2E0 + 4E0 +9E0 = 15E0. So first excited state is 15E0.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So energy is 2E0 +0 + 2*(9E0) = 2E0 +18E0=20E0.

But the options don't have 20E0 as the second excited state. So perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4. Let's think: after first excited state (15E0), the next step would be to promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, making the total energy 20E0. But the options don't have 20E. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. So the second excited state would be 18E. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. So energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm doing this wrong. Let me think about the possible states.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the energy 15E. Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, making the energy 2E + 4E (for remaining n=2) +9E +16E? No, that doesn't add up correctly.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state would have two particles in n=3 and one in n=4. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the possible order of the energy levels. The possible energies for each particle would be n² E.

So, for four particles, the possible ways to distribute them are:

Ground state: 1,1,2,2 → sum E =1+1+4+4=10 E.

First excited state: 1,1,2,3 → sum is 1+1+4+9=15 E.

Second excited state: 1,1,3,3 → sum is 1+1+9+9=20 E.

But none of the options give 20 E. So perhaps the question is considering the energies of each individual state, not the sum? No, the question asks for the energies of the system, which is the sum of all particles' energies.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the spin. Or perhaps the particles are bosons, but they are spin-1/2, which are fermions. Oh, right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so must obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but perhaps the way the particles are arranged is different. Let me think again about the possible states.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are filled in order of increasing n, with each n accommodating two particles (due to spin). So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles → 2*(1² E) = 2E.

n=2: 2 particles → 2*(4 E) =8E.

Total is 10E → ground state.

First excited state: promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Now:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

Total energy: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: promote another particle from n=2 to n=3 → n=1:2, n=3:2.

Energy: 2E + 0 (n=2 has 0) + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4.

So after first excited state is 15E, the next state would be when a particle moves to n=4.

So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1? No, that would require five particles. Wait, no, we have four particles. So maybe in the second excited state, one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4.

Wait, that would mean:

n=1:2 (2E), n=2:1 (4E), n=3:1 (9E), n=4:0.

Wait, no, the fourth particle would be in n=3 or n=4.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when n=1 has 2, n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. So their energies are 2*(1² E) + 2*(3² E) = 2E + 18 E=20E.

But again, none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the question is assuming that each particle is in a different state, which isn't possible because with four particles, you can't have four different n's because each n can take two.

Wait, wait, n=1:2, n=2:2 → four particles. So ground state is 10E.

First excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, making n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 → sum 15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted from n=2 to n=3 → n=1:2, n=3:2 → sum 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the options are considering something else.

Looking back at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

So 10 is ground, 15 first excited, and 18 second. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=4. Let's see: n=4 is 16E per particle. Two in n=4 would be 32E. But that plus the others would be higher than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

Wait, but then the sum would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) → sum is 31E. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and two in n=2. But that can't be because in the first excited state, n=2 has one.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the filling order. Maybe the first excited state is n=1:2, n=2:2, but this is the ground state, so the first excited would be moving to higher n when possible.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible n's, but perhaps some are in higher n's with lower energy? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are not all in the lowest n's because of spin. Wait, but spin doesn't affect the spatial part, just allows for more particles in the same spatial state.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible energy levels for each particle and sum them. Let me think about the possible combinations.

Four particles, each having an n value, but each n can have up to two particles.

The possible n's we can have are 1,2,3,4, etc.

The sum of their n² E would be the total energy.

Ground state: n's are 1,1,2,2 → sum=1+1+4+4=10E.

First excited state: replace one 2 with a 3 → n's 1,1,2,3 → sum=1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: replace another 2 with a 3 → n's 1,1,3,3 → sum=1+1+9+9=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a single particle is in n=3, making the sum 15E. So the second excited state would be when another particle is in n=3, making sum 20E.

But again, none of the options include 20E. So perhaps the options are considering a different scenario, like perhaps the particles are placed in the same n but that's impossible due to Pauli.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are bosons, but the question states they're spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible states. Let me think in terms of the energies as per the options.

Option D: ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How can the energy reach 18E?

n=1:2 (2E), n=2:1 (4E), n=3:1 (9E) → sum 15E.

Next, to get 18E, perhaps the second excited state is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2 → sum 2E + 0 + (2*9E)= 2E +18E=20E, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1 → sum 2E +4E +16E=22E. No.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible energy sums.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the particles can be arranged in a way that their n's are 1,2,3,4. But that would require all four particles to be in different n's, which isn't possible because each n can hold two. Wait, no, that's impossible because for four particles, you'd have two in n=1 and two in n=2, for example.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would require four particles, which would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) → total 31E, which is higher than any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum of the energies but about the individual energies. No, the question says the energies of the system, which is the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energies of individual particles, but that doesn't make sense because the system's energy is the sum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the four particles are arranged in n=1,2,3,4. But each n can hold two, so it's impossible unless we have more particles. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake about the maximum number of particles per n. Since each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), then for four particles, the first two go to n=1, the next two to n=2. So the ground state is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E)= 2E +8E=10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

If we promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, now n=3 has two, so sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the question is considering the first excited state as when a particle is promoted to n=4? Let's see: promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4.

So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has a particle in n=3 and the other arrangements, but this is getting too complicated.

Looking at the options, the only option that starts with 10E (ground state) is option D. Then, first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, 18E would be 18E = 18*E, which is 18E. How can that be achieved?

If two particles are in n=3, 2*(9E)=18E. Plus the other two in n=1: 2E → total 20E. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps one particle is in n=3 (9E) and another in n=4 (16E) → 25E. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4, making the sum 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +16E (n=4) =22E, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. Wait, but that would be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order of the states wrong. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, making the sum 2E + 18E =20E. But since that isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let's see:

Another approach: each particle's energy is E_n =n² E.

So, the possible combinations for four particles, considering spin:

- All four in the same n: impossible, as n can hold two.

- So, the possible combinations are:

1. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → sum=2*(1)+2*(4) = 2+8=10E.

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum=2+4+9=15E.

3. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → sum=2+ 18=20E.

4. 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum=1+8+9=18E.

Wait, wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. That would sum to 1+8+9=18E. So:

Ground state:10E.

First excited state:15E.

Second excited state:18E.

So the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E → which matches option D.

Wait, but wait, how does this configuration happen? Let's see:

In the ground state, 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2 → sum 10E.

When one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, the sum becomes 2 (n=1) +1 (n=2) +9 (n=3) →15E (first excited state).

In the second excited state, perhaps a particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that's not possible because n=1 can't have more than two particles.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but how does that happen? Because each n can hold up to two, perhaps you can have two in n=2, and one each in n=1 and n=3.

Wait, but then the sum is 1 + 8 +9 =18E.

So the order of the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited).

Therefore, the correct option is D:10E,15E,18E.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the following approach:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E
   \]  
   where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \) is the base energy unit, and \( n \) is the quantum number.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each spatial state (defined by \( n \)) can hold at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. For four particles:  
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \).  
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 2^2 E = 8E \).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \):  
   - Two particles remain in \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \).  
   - One particle remains in \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 1 \cdot 2^2 E = 4E \).  
   - One particle moves to \( n = 3 \), contributing \( 1 \cdot 3^2 E = 9E \).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \):  
   - Two particles remain in \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \).  
   - No particles remain in \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 0 \).  
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 3 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 3^2 E = 18E \).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E
   \]

6. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated energies are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 20E \). However, none of the options include \( 20E \). Instead, the second excited state in the options corresponds to \( 18E \), which arises if the configuration is \( n = 1 \) (1 particle), \( n = 2 \) (2 particles), and \( n = 3 \) (1 particle). This configuration gives:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 1 \cdot 1^2 E + 2 \cdot 2^2 E + 1 \cdot 3^2 E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
   \]

Thus, the correct sequence of energies is \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), which matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this quantum mechanics question about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let me think. The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite well of length L. I need to find the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the question defines E as E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each energy level can only hold a certain number of particles. Spin-1/2 particles have spin up and down, so each spatial state can hold two particles.

So the setup is that we have four particles, all spin-1/2, so two each in each spatial state possible. But wait, let me think again. Each energy level (each n) can hold up to two particles because of the spin states. So for each n, you can have two particles, one with spin up and one down.

So the ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration. Since each spatial state can hold two, let's see how the particles fill up the states.

In the ground state, we start filling the lowest n first. So n=1 can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down), n=2 can hold two more. But wait, we have four particles total. So ground state would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=2? Or maybe n=1 holds two, and the next two go into higher n?

Wait, no, maybe I'm thinking about electrons in an atom. Oh wait, in this case, in a 1D box, each energy level is non-degenerate because of the spatial part. So the spatial wavefunction is non-degenerate, so each n corresponds to a single state, but because the particles are spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down, so two particles per spatial state.

So for four particles, the first two (n=1) fill up with spin up and down, then the next two would go into n=2, each with spin up and down. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. Each in n=1 contributes E_1 = (1²)E = E. Each in n=2 contributes E_2 = (2²)E =4E. So two each: 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, that would make the ground state energy 10E? Hmm, but wait, maybe that's the case. Wait, no, no—because each particle in n=1 contributes E, there are two particles there, so 2*E. Similarly, two particles in n=2, so 2*4E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the ground state would be the lowest possible, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy possible configuration. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins). The next two go into n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E=10E. Wait, but in that case, the ground state energy would be 10E. But looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 50E. Hmm, that can't be right because 10E is the first excited state then. Wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the states. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the particles fill up the states. Let's think step by step.

Each spatial state (n) can hold up to 2 particles (spin up and down). So for four identical particles, how are they arranged?

Ground state (lowest energy): n=1 can hold two particles (spins up and down). Then n=2 can hold two particles. So the four particles would occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E. So sum is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. Wait, but the options don't have ground state as 10E. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E, 50E

C)4E, 10E, 15E

D)10E, 15E, 18E

Wait, option D's ground state is 10E. So if the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's, but perhaps in some other arrangement. Or perhaps I'm forgetting that the particles are fermions and their wavefunctions must be anti-symmetric. But in a 1D box, the spatial part is non-degenerate, so each n is a single state, and the spin part would determine the overall symmetry.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of filling the states based on their energy levels. For four particles:

- First, n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down), so two particles here.

- Next, n=2 can hold another 2, so four in total. So the total energy is 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state would be 10E.

But looking at the options, option D has ground state as 10E, and first excited as 15E, second as 18E. But wait, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n, and the excited states have higher n particles.

Wait, but let me think about the first excited state. The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible n's, which would be n=1 and n=2 with two each.

What's the first excited state? The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to the next higher energy level, but wait, no, that's not possible because each n is filled with two particles before moving to the next.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would involve moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. But how?

Wait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake here. For four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The next possible state (first excited) would have one particle promoted to a higher n. But can that happen? Because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state has two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but then that may not be the case. Because the way the states are filled is based on the Pauli exclusion. So when you have four particles, the first two go to n=1 (spin up and down), the next two go to n=2, same spin. So the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2, energy 10E.

Then, the first excited state would involve moving a particle from n=2 to the next available n, which is n=3. So now you have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 1*(2²E) + 1*(3²E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, so now 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E=20E. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the second excited state. Alternatively, perhaps the next state after first excited is different.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? But wait, n=1 can only hold two particles because of spin, so that's not possible. So that can't happen.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each particle can have their own n, but with spin considered. So each spatial state can hold two particles. Let me list the possible fillings:

Ground state:
n=1: 2 particles (spins up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spins up and down)
Total energy: 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state:
Maybe one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. So n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. So the energy is 2*1E +1*(4E) +1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: Now, the next possible configuration. Maybe another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So energy is 2*1E +0 + 2*9E= 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E as the second excited state. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 30E, 39E,50E.

Option B:4,10,50.

Option C:4,10,15.

Option D:10,15,18.

Wait, none of the options have 20E. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the states are filled.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spin affects the multiplicity, but in a 1D box, each n is a single state. So when you have spin-1/2, you can have two particles per n.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same spatial state, but that's impossible because of the Pauli exclusion. So no, each n can only have two. So for four particles, it's n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), as before.

So ground state energy is 10E. Then the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so you have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Energy 2*E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when two particles are in n=3, so n=1:2, n=3:2. So energy is 2E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state after 15E is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=2 can't have any more particles because it's already at one after the first excited state. Wait, no. Wait, n=2 can have up to two particles. So in the first excited state, n=2 has one, but in the ground state it had two. So perhaps the first excited state could be when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but then you have n=2 with one and n=3 with one. Then, the next step would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making n=2 have zero and n=3 have two.

So the energies:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are E= n² E0, where E0 is the base unit (E0 = E as given).

Now, for four particles, each spatial state can take two, so:

n=1: 2 particles → 2*(1²) E0 = 2E0.

n=2: 2 particles → 2*(4) E0 = 8E0.

Total energy: 10E0. So ground state is 10E0.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says ground state is 10E, which lines up. Then, first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3. So n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. So the energy is 2E0 + 4E0 +9E0 = 15E0. So first excited state is 15E0.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So energy is 2E0 +0 + 2*(9E0) = 2E0 +18E0=20E0.

But the options don't have 20E0 as the second excited state. So perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4. Let's think: after first excited state (15E0), the next step would be to promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, making the total energy 20E0. But the options don't have 20E. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. So the second excited state would be 18E. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. So energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm doing this wrong. Let me think about the possible states.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the energy 15E. Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, making the energy 2E + 4E (for remaining n=2) +9E +16E? No, that doesn't add up correctly.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state would have two particles in n=3 and one in n=4. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the possible order of the energy levels. The possible energies for each particle would be n² E.

So, for four particles, the possible ways to distribute them are:

Ground state: 1,1,2,2 → sum E =1+1+4+4=10 E.

First excited state: 1,1,2,3 → sum is 1+1+4+9=15 E.

Second excited state: 1,1,3,3 → sum is 1+1+9+9=20 E.

But none of the options give 20 E. So perhaps the question is considering the energies of each individual state, not the sum? No, the question asks for the energies of the system, which is the sum of all particles' energies.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the spin. Or perhaps the particles are bosons, but they are spin-1/2, which are fermions. Oh, right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so must obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but perhaps the way the particles are arranged is different. Let me think again about the possible states.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are filled in order of increasing n, with each n accommodating two particles (due to spin). So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles → 2*(1² E) = 2E.

n=2: 2 particles → 2*(4 E) =8E.

Total is 10E → ground state.

First excited state: promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Now:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

Total energy: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: promote another particle from n=2 to n=3 → n=1:2, n=3:2.

Energy: 2E + 0 (n=2 has 0) + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4.

So after first excited state is 15E, the next state would be when a particle moves to n=4.

So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1? No, that would require five particles. Wait, no, we have four particles. So maybe in the second excited state, one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4.

Wait, that would mean:

n=1:2 (2E), n=2:1 (4E), n=3:1 (9E), n=4:0.

Wait, no, the fourth particle would be in n=3 or n=4.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when n=1 has 2, n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. So their energies are 2*(1² E) + 2*(3² E) = 2E + 18 E=20E.

But again, none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the question is assuming that each particle is in a different state, which isn't possible because with four particles, you can't have four different n's because each n can take two.

Wait, wait, n=1:2, n=2:2 → four particles. So ground state is 10E.

First excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, making n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 → sum 15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted from n=2 to n=3 → n=1:2, n=3:2 → sum 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the options are considering something else.

Looking back at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

So 10 is ground, 15 first excited, and 18 second. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=4. Let's see: n=4 is 16E per particle. Two in n=4 would be 32E. But that plus the others would be higher than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

Wait, but then the sum would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) → sum is 31E. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and two in n=2. But that can't be because in the first excited state, n=2 has one.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the filling order. Maybe the first excited state is n=1:2, n=2:2, but this is the ground state, so the first excited would be moving to higher n when possible.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible n's, but perhaps some are in higher n's with lower energy? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are not all in the lowest n's because of spin. Wait, but spin doesn't affect the spatial part, just allows for more particles in the same spatial state.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible energy levels for each particle and sum them. Let me think about the possible combinations.

Four particles, each having an n value, but each n can have up to two particles.

The possible n's we can have are 1,2,3,4, etc.

The sum of their n² E would be the total energy.

Ground state: n's are 1,1,2,2 → sum=1+1+4+4=10E.

First excited state: replace one 2 with a 3 → n's 1,1,2,3 → sum=1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: replace another 2 with a 3 → n's 1,1,3,3 → sum=1+1+9+9=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a single particle is in n=3, making the sum 15E. So the second excited state would be when another particle is in n=3, making sum 20E.

But again, none of the options include 20E. So perhaps the options are considering a different scenario, like perhaps the particles are placed in the same n but that's impossible due to Pauli.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are bosons, but the question states they're spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible states. Let me think in terms of the energies as per the options.

Option D: ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How can the energy reach 18E?

n=1:2 (2E), n=2:1 (4E), n=3:1 (9E) → sum 15E.

Next, to get 18E, perhaps the second excited state is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2 → sum 2E + 0 + (2*9E)= 2E +18E=20E, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1 → sum 2E +4E +16E=22E. No.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible energy sums.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the particles can be arranged in a way that their n's are 1,2,3,4. But that would require all four particles to be in different n's, which isn't possible because each n can hold two. Wait, no, that's impossible because for four particles, you'd have two in n=1 and two in n=2, for example.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would require four particles, which would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) → total 31E, which is higher than any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum of the energies but about the individual energies. No, the question says the energies of the system, which is the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energies of individual particles, but that doesn't make sense because the system's energy is the sum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the four particles are arranged in n=1,2,3,4. But each n can hold two, so it's impossible unless we have more particles. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake about the maximum number of particles per n. Since each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), then for four particles, the first two go to n=1, the next two to n=2. So the ground state is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E)= 2E +8E=10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

If we promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, now n=3 has two, so sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the question is considering the first excited state as when a particle is promoted to n=4? Let's see: promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4.

So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has a particle in n=3 and the other arrangements, but this is getting too complicated.

Looking at the options, the only option that starts with 10E (ground state) is option D. Then, first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, 18E would be 18E = 18*E, which is 18E. How can that be achieved?

If two particles are in n=3, 2*(9E)=18E. Plus the other two in n=1: 2E → total 20E. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps one particle is in n=3 (9E) and another in n=4 (16E) → 25E. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4, making the sum 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +16E (n=4) =22E, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. Wait, but that would be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order of the states wrong. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, making the sum 2E + 18E =20E. But since that isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let's see:

Another approach: each particle's energy is E_n =n² E.

So, the possible combinations for four particles, considering spin:

- All four in the same n: impossible, as n can hold two.

- So, the possible combinations are:

1. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → sum=2*(1)+2*(4) = 2+8=10E.

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum=2+4+9=15E.

3. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → sum=2+ 18=20E.

4. 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum=1+8+9=18E.

Wait, wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. That would sum to 1+8+9=18E. So:

Ground state:10E.

First excited state:15E.

Second excited state:18E.

So the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E → which matches option D.

Wait, but wait, how does this configuration happen? Let's see:

In the ground state, 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2 → sum 10E.

When one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, the sum becomes 2 (n=1) +1 (n=2) +9 (n=3) →15E (first excited state).

In the second excited state, perhaps a particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that's not possible because n=1 can't have more than two particles.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but how does that happen? Because each n can hold up to two, perhaps you can have two in n=2, and one each in n=1 and n=3.

Wait, but then the sum is 1 + 8 +9 =18E.

So the order of the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited).

Therefore, the correct option is D:10E,15E,18E.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the following approach:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E
   \]  
   where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \) is the base energy unit, and \( n \) is the quantum number.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each spatial state (defined by \( n \)) can hold at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. For four particles:  
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \).  
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 2^2 E = 8E \).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \):  
   - Two particles remain in \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \).  
   - One particle remains in \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 1 \cdot 2^2 E = 4E \).  
   - One particle moves to \( n = 3 \), contributing \( 1 \cdot 3^2 E = 9E \).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \):  
   - Two particles remain in \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 1^2 E = 2E \).  
   - No particles remain in \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 0 \).  
   - Two particles occupy \( n = 3 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 3^2 E = 18E \).  
   Total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E
   \]

6. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated energies are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 20E \). However, none of the options include \( 20E \). Instead, the second excited state in the options corresponds to \( 18E \), which arises if the configuration is \( n = 1 \) (1 particle), \( n = 2 \) (2 particles), and \( n = 3 \) (1 particle). This configuration gives:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 1 \cdot 1^2 E + 2 \cdot 2^2 E + 1 \cdot 3^2 E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
   \]

Thus, the correct sequence of energies is \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), which matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
