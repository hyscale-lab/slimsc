Okay, so I've got this question about non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant. And N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Okay, I remember that Gaussian states include things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states have more complex structures, like Fock states or cat states.

The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. The formula for del_b is given as the difference between the traces of rho ln rho and tau ln tau. So del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). I think this is the relative entropy between rho and tau, which measures how non-Gaussian the state is.

Wait, relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, del_b, is often used to quantify how non-Gaussian a state is by comparing it to the closest Gaussian state. So if the state were Gaussian, rho would be equal to tau, and del_b would be zero. That makes sense.

So for this problem, phi is given as -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. Let me plug these values in.

First, let's compute N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2)= -1. So yes, N = sqrt(1 - exp(-alpha² *2)). Wait, no, 2 alpha squared is 2*(0.5)^2=0.5. So exp(-0.5)≈0.6065. So 1 -0.6065=0.3935. Square root is about 0.6275, correct.

So the state is |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071. Sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071.

So |psi> = [0.7071 |0.5> -0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but what are |alpha> and |-alpha>? Those are coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, right? But when you superpose them with a phase factor, you get a non-Gaussian state, like a cat state.

So the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. That makes it a non-Gaussian state, specifically a two-mode squeezed state or a cat state.

Now, to compute the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. The problem is, I'm a bit confused about how to proceed. Because to compute the relative entropy, I need the density matrices of both rho (the state psi) and tau (the reference Gaussian state). But what is the reference Gaussian state here?

Wait, maybe the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to rho. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps for a cat state, the closest Gaussian state is a thermal state or maybe another coherent state. Alternatively, perhaps it's the state you would get if you ignored the non-Gaussian features.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Because the question is about calculating del_b, which is the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is a Gaussian state. But without knowing tau, how do I compute it?

Wait, perhaps the way to compute non-Gaussianity via relative entropy is to compare the state rho to the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not sure exactly how that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two parts that make up the superposition.

Wait, let me think. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau could be the convex combination of |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha|. But wait, that would make tau a classical mixture, which for coherent states, which are pure Gaussian states, would be a mixed Gaussian state.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to rho, but I don't know how to compute that off the top of my head.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the entropy of rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, then find the difference.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is sometimes computed as the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I recall that for a state rho, the non-Gaussianity can be defined as the relative entropy between rho and the Gaussian state tau that is closest to rho. So we need to find tau that minimizes this relative entropy.

But finding the optimal Gaussian state tau is non-trivial. Alternatively, perhaps for a two-mode state like this, the optimal Gaussian state is a thermal state or something simple.

Hmm, but I'm stuck on how to proceed. Wait, maybe the problem is designed to have an easier solution because of specific parameter values. Let me think about the parameters.

Phi is -pi/4, alpha is 0.5. Let's substitute these into the state.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N, with N as we computed.

But then, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The question is about the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state tau. If the state |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, then del_b would be positive. If it were Gaussian, del_b would be zero.

Wait, but the question is asking for the non-Gaussianity in the cat state. I remember that a cat state is highly non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be a positive value.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C are positive, D is zero. So the answer is not D.

But wait, perhaps in some cases, the state is Gaussian. When would that happen?

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. For a superposition of two coherent states to be Gaussian, the coefficients would have to satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. When you take a superposition of two, you get a state that's generally non-Gaussian unless the superposition has some particular form.

Wait, another thought: if the state is a coherent state, it would be Gaussian. But |psi> here is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So when would this be a coherent state?

Wait, maybe if phi is zero, then |psi> would be |alpha> divided by N. Because if phi is zero, cos(phi)=1, sin(phi)=0. So it's just |alpha> normalized, which is a coherent state, hence Gaussian.

Similarly, if phi is pi/2, sin(phi)=1, cos(phi)=0. So |psi> would be |-alpha> normalized, also a coherent state.

But in this problem, phi is -pi/4, which is neither 0 nor pi/2. So the state is a superposition, thus non-Gaussian.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so the answer is either A, B, or C.

But how do I calculate it?

Wait, maybe I can find the density matrices.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau. What is the closest Gaussian state to rho? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps in this case, the reference state is a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with probability 1/2. Because the state |psi> is an equal superposition (since cos(phi) and sin(phi) have the same magnitude when phi is -pi/4: cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So their squares are 0.5 each.

Wait, but in that case, the state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-alpha^2 * 2)) )? Wait, no, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). For phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2)=-1. So N= sqrt(1 - exp(-alpha^2 * 2)).

Wait, alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 gives 0.5. So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So rho is |psi><psi|, which is (|alpha><alpha| - |alpha><-alpha| - |-alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha|) / N².

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to compute the relative entropy between rho and tau. Maybe I can compute the von Neumann entropy of rho and the entropy of tau, then subtract.

Wait, the relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Wait, no, wait: the relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Oh wait, but the question defines del_b as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). That's a bit different.

Wait, the problem says del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). That's the same as [S(rho) - S(tau)] where S is the von Neumann entropy because S(rho) is Tr(rho ln rho), and S(tau) is Tr(tau ln tau).

So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, so if tau is the closest Gaussian state, then del_b would be the non-Gaussianity.

But how do I find S(tau) and S(rho)?

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again about the parameters.

Wait, when alpha is 0.5, which is a small value. So the coherent states are not too spread out.

Wait, another approach: I remember that for certain states, like coherent states, the entropy is minimal (zero for pure states), but mixed states have higher entropy. But in this case, the state is a superposition, so rho is a pure state. So S(rho) is zero because rho is a pure state. Wait, no, wait: rho is |psi><psi|, so rho is pure and S(rho)=0.

Wait, no, wait: wait, S(rho) is the entropy of rho, which for a pure state is zero. Because for a pure state, the density matrix is idempotent (rho^2 = rho), so ln rho is zero? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the von Neumann entropy is S = - Tr(rho ln rho). For a pure state, rho is a projector, so rho ln rho is zero because ln(rho) would be ln(1) when rho is 1 for the pure state. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, for a pure state, rho = |psi><psi|. So rho squared is rho, so rho is idempotent. Then, the eigenvalues of rho are 1 and 0. So ln(rho) would have eigenvalues 0 and -infty, but when you take the trace, the -infty would contribute nothing because they're multiplied by zero. So Tr(rho ln rho) = 0. So for a pure state, S(rho) = 0.

In this case, rho is a pure state, so S(rho)=0.

Then, del_b is 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). Wait, but that would make del_b negative, which can't be right because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.

Wait, let's double-check the definition. The problem says del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So if rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = 0 - Tr(tau ln tau) = - Tr(tau ln tau).

But Tr(tau ln tau) is the entropy of tau, S(tau). So del_b = - S(tau).

But that would mean del_b is negative. But non-Gaussianity should be positive. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I'm interpreting the formula wrong. Perhaps the relative entropy is the other way around: S(tau || rho), which would be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho), which is S(tau) - 0. So that would be positive.

Wait, but the problem's definition is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Which is 0 - S(tau). So it's negative. That doesn't make sense for a non-Gaussianity measure, which should be positive. So perhaps I've made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the reference state. Let me think: perhaps the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to the state rho. So the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau.

But regardless, the formula given is as per the problem statement. So perhaps I should proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the density matrix of rho and tau and calculate the entropies.

But this seems very involved, and I'm not sure I can do it without specific tools or more information. Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero in this case.

Wait, when alpha is zero, the state would be a superposition of |0> and |0>, which is just |0>, a coherent state, hence Gaussian. But in this case, alpha is 0.5, so it's a non-zero amplitude.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the specific state in question is a Gaussian state under certain conditions. For example, when the state is a coherent state, it's Gaussian. But when it's a superposition of coherent states, it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, but when is the superposition of two coherent states Gaussian? I think it's only when the states are the same, which would collapse back to a coherent state.

So in our case, since the two coherent states are different (alpha and -alpha), the state |psi> is non-Gaussian. Hence, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so the answer is not D.

But without knowing the specific form of tau, how can I compute this? Maybe the question expects me to recognize that the relative entropy is zero under certain conditions.

Wait, another angle: perhaps when the state is a cat state, the non-Gaussianity is positive, but for certain parameters, the non-Gaussianity could be zero. When would that happen? Only if the state is Gaussian, but that's not the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options. The options are A) 2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

Wait, but all the options except D are positive. So if the state is non-Gaussian, the answer should be positive. So D is zero, which would imply the state is Gaussian, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait a minute, is the state |psi> a Gaussian state? Let me think about it.

Wait, the state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are not necessarily Gaussian. So this should be a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so the answer would be A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact calculation, how can I decide? Alternatively, perhaps the value of del_b is zero if and only if the state is Gaussian. Since this state is non-Gaussian, the answer should be positive.

But looking at the options, all except D are positive. So perhaps the answer is A, B, or C.

Wait, another thought: maybe when the state is a cat state with certain parameters, the relative entropy is zero. But that doesn't make sense because a cat state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about calculating the relative entropy but some other form. Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero here due to some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the state is actually a Gaussian state when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. Let me think: For phi = -pi/4, the coefficients are equal in magnitude (sqrt(2)/2 each). So the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N.

Wait, but if N is sqrt(2 (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)) ), then for alpha=0, this reduces to |0>, which is Gaussian. But for alpha=0.5, it's a superposition, so non-Gaussian.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should think about the definition of Gaussian states. Gaussian states are those with Wigner functions that are Gaussian distributions. Coherent states are Gaussian. Squeezed states are Gaussian. But any superposition of them is non-Gaussian.

Therefore, |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity is positive, so the answer is one of A, B, or C.

But without more specific knowledge, perhaps I should look for other clues. Wait, perhaps when alpha approaches zero, the non-Gaussianity approaches zero. Because the state becomes |0>, which is Gaussian.

At alpha=0.5, the non-Gaussianity should be some positive value. But without calculating, I don't know which option it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the state is actually Gaussian, but I can't see how. Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is a thermal state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, but the state |psi> given is a pure state. Thermal states are mixed. So that can't be.

Another approach: Perhaps the state |psi> can be rewritten in a way that it is a Gaussian state. Let me try.

The state is [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

When phi is such that the coefficients are real, perhaps this could be a Gaussian state. Alternatively, perhaps some other condition.

Alternatively, perhaps for certain phi and alpha, the state is a coherent state. Wait, when would [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] be equal to a coherent state?

Wait, perhaps when phi is zero, it's |alpha> normalized, which is a coherent state. Similarly, when phi is pi/2, it's |-alpha> normalized, which is also a coherent state. But in between, it's a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

So, at phi = -pi/4, it's a superposition, non-Gaussian. So, non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But since I can't compute the exact value, perhaps I should think about the options again. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C)1.38, D)0. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D)0. But that would imply the state is Gaussian, which contradicts what I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the state reduces to a Gaussian state for some reason.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking that the state is non-Gaussian. Let me think again.

Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Take a superposition of two coherent states. The expectation value of position/momentum would depend on interference terms. But whether the state is Gaussian or not depends on whether the Wigner function is Gaussian.

Wait, another thought: the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's a cat state. I've heard that cat states are maximally non-Gaussian. So their non-Gaussianity should be high. So the relative entropy would be a larger positive number.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.48, which seems large. But without exact calculations, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero, implying the state is Gaussian, which would mean the answer is D.

But how?

Wait, another idea: perhaps when the superposition is symmetric. Let me think: the state is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N.

Wait, let's compute the expectation value of the number operator.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The expectation value <n> is Tr(rho a† a).

But perhaps that's not directly helpful for non-Gaussianity.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be rewritten in terms of Fock states, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the state is a photon-added or subtracted state, which is non-Gaussian, but again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Without the exact formula for the relative entropy between rho and tau, I can't compute the precise value. But given the options, perhaps the answer is D)0, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a coherent state. But that's only when phi is 0 or pi/2, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, I'm really not sure. Since the options don't include a 'Cannot be determined' option, I have to choose among the given.

Wait, another approach: when the state is a coherent state, the non-Gaussianity is zero. But in this case, it's a superposition, so non-zero.

Wait, but wait, perhaps for this specific phi and alpha, the state becomes a coherent state. Let me check.

Phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2.

The state is [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ] / N.

Wait, perhaps this can be written as a coherent state with a different alpha. Let me compute.

Wait, perhaps |beta> = [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / sqrt(2). Because if beta is such that |beta> equals that, then it's a coherent state. But is that the case?

Wait, a coherent state |beta> is defined by a complex amplitude beta. But a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> would generally not be a coherent state unless the coefficients satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state |psi> can be written as a single coherent state.

Wait, perhaps |psi> = e^{i theta} |gamma> for some gamma and theta. But I don't think so, because a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> involves different phases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But I'm not certain.

Hmm. Without knowing more, perhaps the answer is D)0, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero, but I can't see why.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is designed to have the non-Gaussianity zero because the state is a coherent state. But that's not the case here. 

Wait, considering all this, I think the correct answer is D)0. But I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\), and the non-Gaussianity is quantified using the relative entropy measure:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Definition**: For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(-\pi/4) = \pm \sqrt{2}/2\), the state simplifies to:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 |0.5\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 |-0.5\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   Here, \(N = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.6275\).

2. **Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian**: Coherent states \(| \alpha \rangle\) and \(|- \alpha \rangle\) are Gaussian. However, their superposition, as in \(|\psi\rangle\), is generally non-Gaussian unless the coefficients satisfy specific conditions. For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, making it a non-Gaussian state.

3. **Relative Entropy of Non-Gaussianity**: The relative entropy \(\Delta_b\) measures the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). For a pure state like \(|\psi\rangle\), \(\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = 0\). Thus, \(\Delta_b = -\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau)\), which is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). Since the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is non-Gaussian, \(\Delta_b\) should be positive.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2.48)**: This is a large positive value, suggesting significant non-Gaussianity.
   - **Option B (0.25)**: This is a small positive value, indicating mild non-Gaussianity.
   - **Option C (1.38)**: This is a moderate positive value, suggesting moderate non-Gaussianity.
   - **Option D (0)**: This implies the state is Gaussian, which contradicts the fact that \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of coherent states, it is non-Gaussian, and \(\Delta_b\) should be positive. However, without explicit calculations of \(\Delta_b\), the exact value cannot be determined. Based on the options provided, the most plausible answer is **D (0)**, but this contradicts the reasoning that the state is non-Gaussian.

### Final Answer:
Answer: D
