Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, Pauli statistics apply to identical particles, right? Which must obey the exclusion principle, meaning their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. Since the two nucleons are identical fermions, their combined wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. The wavefunction includes spin, spatial, and other quantum numbers.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin is zero. I think isospin is another way of looking at the strong interaction, kind of like a spin but for nuclear forces. But maybe for this problem, isospin T relates to the symmetry under exchange.

Wait, the condition given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So T is the total isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and they sum plus 1, mod 2.

So if T is 0, then 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L + 1 must be even, so S + L must be odd. Because 0 mod 2 is 0, so 0 ≡ (S+L +1) mod 2 → S+L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. One even, the other odd.

So the final NN state must have S and L such that their sum is odd. So either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1 → S=0. So the initial spin is 0. The L here is S, so orbital angular momentum is 0. And J, the total angular momentum, is 0 as well (since S=0 and L=0, J=0).

So initial state: S_initial = 0, L_initial =0, J_initial =0.

They emit a particle X. So it's a two-body decay, but wait, no, it's a bound system emitting a particle. So the process is NN → NN' + X? Wait, no: the question says it's a bound system of two nucleons emitting a particle X. So the initial state is two nucleons bound as a system, and they emit X, so the final state is the two nucleons plus X.

Wait, no, wait. Because the initial state is two nucleons bound in a 1S0 state. Then they emit a particle X, so the final state is the same two nucleons (but in a different state) plus the emitted X. So the process is: NN → NN' + X.

But wait, perhaps I should think about it as a decay: the system NN in 1S0 state emits a particle X, so the NN moves into another state, and X is emitted. So the initial NN is 1S0, and the final NN has some other state.

So in terms of angular momentum and parity conservation, the process must conserve both. So the initial state's angular momentum and parity must equal the sum (vectorially) of the final state's plus the emitted particle X.

But wait, in terms of parity, each term's parity is a product of the intrinsic parity of the particles and their orbital parts.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, the initial state is NN in 1S0. So their spin S is 0, orbital L is 0, so J is 0. The parity of the initial state would be (-1)^L, which is (-1)^0 = 1. Also, considering their isospin, but perhaps that's not directly relevant for parity.

When they emit a particle X, the final state is NN' (with some state) and X.

But more accurately, the process is:

Initial state: 1S0 (NN) → Final state: NN' (in some state) + X.

But I think I should model this as the initial state having certain quantum numbers, and the final state (NN') plus X having the same quantum numbers, considering conservation.

Wait, but since X is emitted, the NN' system will have some angular momentum and spin, and X has its own. So angular momentum must be conserved, meaning the total angular momentum in the initial state must equal the sum (vectorially) of the angular momentum of the final NN' and that of X. But since the initial state has J=0 (because L=0 and S=0), the total J must be zero in the final state as well, considering all parts.

Similarly, parity must be conserved. The initial parity is +1. The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X, multiplied by the parity due to the orbital angular momentum involved in their separation.

Wait, the orbital angular momentum part comes into play because the emission of X involves the two nucleons moving in some relative orbit. So when X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system must be considered as part of their state.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum and parity conservation in the decay.

The initial state has J=0, L=0, S=0, and parity +1.

After emission of X, the final state has the NN' system in some state with spin S', orbital angular momentum L', and thus total angular momentum J' = S' + L' (vectorially). Also, X has its own angular momentum, say, l. The orbital angular momentum of the emission process would contribute to the relative motion between the NN' system and X.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should model this using the conservation of angular momentum and parity for the entire system.

So, the process is:

Initial state: J_initial = 0, parity_initial = +1.

Final state: The NN' system has orbital angular momentum L_f, spin S_f. The emitted X has orbital angular momentum l (from the emission process) and its own spin s. But for the parity, what matters is the intrinsic parity of X and the orbital part.

Wait, the total parity P_total after emission is P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^L_emission, where L_emission is the orbital angular momentum associated with the position of X relative to the NN' system. Because when you emit a particle, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle in the decay process contributes to the parity.

But for this problem, perhaps it's sufficient to consider that the parity of the final state (which is the product of the parity of the NN' system and X, multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay).

Wait, but the parity of the entire system must be the same as the initial parity. Since the initial parity is +1, the final parity must also be +1.

So, P_initial = P_final. P_initial is +1.

P_final = [P_NN'] * [P_X] * (-1)^L,

where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emission process (the relative orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X).

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Another way: the parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and the parity from their orbital motion. So if the NN' system has orbital angular momentum L, and the X is emitted in some orbital state l, but perhaps the total orbital angular momentum L_total is L + l (vectorially)? But I think the orbital part that contributes to the parity is the relative orbital angular momentum between the two parts.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum between the NN' system and X is l. So the parity contribution from that is (-1)^l.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think differently.

The initial state has NN in 1S0: so their spin is 0, orbital angular momentum is 0. So their parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

After emitting X, the NN' system has some orbital angular momentum L, spin S, total angular momentum J = L + S. The emitted X has its own angular momentum l, which is the orbital angular momentum associated with its emission.

But for parity, the overall parity is [P_NN'] * [P_X] * (-1)^L_emission, where L_emission is the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN' system. Because when the X is emitted, it's moving in some orbit around the NN' system, so the orbital part contributes (-1)^L_emission.

But the parity of the NN' system is itself (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' relative to each other. Wait, no: the orbital angular momentum within the NN' system is their relative orbital angular momentum, which is L.

So the overall parity of the final state (NN' + X) would be the product of the parity of NN' and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^L_emission.

But wait, the parity of the NN' system is (-1)^L.

The parity of the X is given as -1 (intrinsic).

So the total parity is:

P_final = [(-1)^L] * (-1) * (-1)^{L_emission}.

But this must equal the initial parity, which is +1.

So,

[(-1)^L] * (-1) * (-1)^{L_emission} = 1.

Simplify:

(-1)^L * (-1) * (-1)^{L_emission} = (-1)^{L + 1 + L_emission} = 1.

So,

L + 1 + L_emission ≡ 0 mod 2.

Which implies that L_emission ≡ L + 1 mod 2.

Hmm, but L_emission is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay. So perhaps the parity condition is leading to a relation between L (the orbital angular momentum of the final NN' state) and L_emission.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the decay must conserve parity. So the parity of the initial state equals the parity of the final state.

Initial parity P_initial = +1.

Final parity P_final = [parity of NN'] * [parity of X] * (-1)^L_emission.

Because the parity of the NN' system is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is their orbital angular momentum, and the parity of X is -1 (given). The (-1)^L_emission comes from X's orbital motion relative to the NN' system.

So,

P_final = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^L_emission.

Which simplifies to (-1)^{L' + L_emission + 1}.

Set this equal to initial parity:

(-1)^{L' + L_emission + 1} = +1 → exponent must be even.

So,

L' + L_emission + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → L' + L_emission ≡ 1 mod 2.

But L_emission is the angular momentum of X in the decay. But how does this relate to the angular momentum of the emitted particle in the options?

Wait, the options give the state of X with a lower case letter, like 'p' for l=1, 's' for l=0, 'f' for l=3, etc. So for each option, the emitted X has a particular orbital angular momentum l (denoted by the letter, e.g., p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, d is l=2, etc.)

Wait, but perhaps the orbital angular momentum l of X is the same as L_emission. Because X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l relative to the NN' system. So L_emission = l.

So substituting L_emission = l, the parity condition becomes:

L' + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So,

L' + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

Ok, now, considering angular momentum conservation.

The initial state has J = 0. The final state's total angular momentum must also be 0. The total angular momentum is the sum of the angular momentum of the NN' system (J') and that of X (which has l, but also spin, but X's spin is part of its intrinsic angular momentum. Wait, but X's spin is s, which is in addition to its orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum for X is l + s.

But wait, the NN' system must have angular momentum J', which is the sum of their spin S' and orbital angular momentum L'.

So J' = S' + L'. 

The total angular momentum of the system after emission is J' (for NN') plus (l + s_X), where s_X is the spin of X. This must equal the initial J=0.

But J is a vector, so adding them vectorially. So for the total J to be zero, the individual parts must cancel each other. But this could be complicated, as it's a vector sum. However, perhaps in this problem, we can consider the possible cases where the scalar sum (mod 2) is zero.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is more about the possible angular momentum quantum numbers, not their vector sums. So maybe the consideration is that the angular momentum quantum numbers must satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem only requires considering the orbital angular momentum and spin in a way that the total angular momentum is zero.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should focus on the parity condition first, as it's giving me a relation between L' and l, and then see the spin condition from Pauli's exclusion principle.

Wait, the Pauli statistics condition given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Remember, T is the isospin of the NN' system.

The final state has T=0, so 0 ≡ S' + L' + 1 mod 2 → S' + L' ≡ 1 mod 2. So S' and L' must have opposite parity.

So, S' + L' must be odd.

So, for each option, we can determine the allowed L' and S' based on the emitted X's orbital angular momentum l.

Wait, the options give the state of X as, for example, 7D1 + p. The notation is a bit unclear, but I think each option is showing the transition from the initial 1S0 state to a final NN state with some L and S, and X has a certain orbital angular momentum (denoted by the lower case letter). 

Wait, let's parse each option.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p

Hmm, this probably means the final NN state is in a 7D1 state, and X is emitted in 'p' state (l=1). So the X's orbital angular momentum is l=1.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p → X is p (l=1)

Option C:1S0 → 3D3 + f → X is f (l=3)

Option D:1S0 →3P0 + s → X is s (l=0)

Wait, but in each case, the first part is the final NN state. For example, 7D1 would mean (2S'+1) =7 → S' =3, and L'=D=2. So for option A:

Final NN state: 7D1 → (2S'+1)L' =7D1 → S'=3, L'=2.

So S' = 3, L' =2.

So, from the Pauli condition, S' + L' must be odd, as T=0.

3 +2 =5 → odd → satisfies the condition.

So option A is allowed, I think.

Now, the parity condition for each option.

Parity condition: L' + l ≡1 mod 2.

So for each option, we calculate L' + l mod 2.

Option A: L'=2, l=1 (p). 2+1=3 → 1 mod 2 → satisfies parity condition.

Option B: The final state is 3S1 → (2S'+1) =3 → S'=1. L'=S=0.

So L' =0, l=p=1.

So L' + l =0+1=1 → 1 mod 2 → satisfies parity condition.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1. L'=D=2.

So L'=2. X is f, l=3.

L' + l =2+3=5 → 1 mod2 → satisfies parity condition.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1. L'=P=1.

So L'=1. X is s, l=0.

L' + l =1+0=1 → 1 mod2 → satisfies parity condition.

Wait, but all options satisfy the parity condition. So perhaps there's another condition. Let me think again.

Wait, I might have made a mistake in the parity expression. Let me re-examine the parity condition.

Earlier, I thought the parity condition is L' + l ≡1 mod2. But from the initial analysis, the parity condition came from:

(-1)^{L' + l +1} = 1 → exponent must be even → L' + l +1 ≡0 mod2 → L' + l ≡1 mod2.

So each option must satisfy L' + l ≡1 mod2. And all the options do that.

So perhaps I'm missing another condition. Let's think about angular momentum conservation.

The initial angular momentum J_initial is 0. The final state must have J_final = J_NN' + J_X = 0.

J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' system, which is S' + L'.

J_X is the total angular momentum of X, which is l + s_X, where s_X is X's spin.

But wait, X's spin is either integer or half-integer, depending on the particle. But the problem doesn't specify X's spin, so perhaps we're to ignore it for this problem. Alternatively, maybe the spin of X doesn't affect because it's a scalar or something. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the orbital angular momentum, as the spin might not affect the parity and the Pauli condition.

Wait, the problem statement mentions that the final NN state has T=0 and that the Pauli statistics condition is T = S' + L' +1 mod2.

So, perhaps the spin of X is not affecting that condition. So perhaps the spin of X is not important for the condition given.

But to ensure angular momentum conservation, the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must equal the initial J=0.

So,

J_NN' + J_X =0.

But J_NN' is S' + L', and J_X is l (orbital) + s_X (spin). But without knowing s_X, this might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the spin of X is not being considered, and only the orbital angular momentum is involved. Or perhaps X is a spin-0 particle. But the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, which could be a pion, which is spin 0. Oh wait, pions are spin 0. So X could be a pion, which has spin 0.

If X is spin 0, then J_X = l.

So J_X = l, and J_NN' = S' + L'.

So for the total angular momentum to be zero, J_NN' must be equal and opposite to J_X. But since J is a vector, this would require J_NN' = -J_X. But since J is a vector, this could be possible only if J_NN' and J_X are in opposite directions and their magnitudes are equal.

But considering that J is a vector, perhaps in some cases the sum can cancel out. 

But maybe the problem is assuming that the spin of X is zero. Because if X is a pion, which is a pseudoscalar (spin 0, parity -1).

So let's assume X is spin 0. Then J_X = l.

So the total angular momentum is J_NN' + l =0.

So J_NN' must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to l. But since J is a vector, this is possible only if both have the same magnitude and opposite directions, leading to a total of zero.

But since J_NN' is S' + L', which can have a magnitude range from |S' - L'| to S' + L' in integer steps.

But perhaps the problem is not considering the spin and only looks at whether the angular momentum quantum numbers allow for such a condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the scalar sum of angular momenta, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the initial state has J=0, the sum of the angular momenta of the NN' and X must result in zero. So J_NN' and J_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. But without knowing the directions, perhaps it's tricky. 

But perhaps the problem is considering that the orbital angular momentum and spin are such that their sum could be zero. 

Wait, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can ignore the vector nature and just ensure that the individual quantum numbers (like L' and l) allow for the possibility of the vectors adding to zero. Since we're only given the quantum numbers, perhaps the problem is more about whether the allowed values of L' and l could sum to zero when considering their possible values. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply considering that the parity condition is satisfied and the Pauli condition is satisfied, and that the angular momentum can be zero when considering the possible values.

But since all options satisfy the parity condition, perhaps another condition comes into play.

Wait, maybe the options also have to satisfy that the orbital angular momentum of the X (l) plus the orbital angular momentum of the NN' (L') is such that their sum allows for the total angular momentum J=0.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Final state is 7D1 → S'=3, L'=2. X is p → l=1.

Parity condition: L' + l =2+1=3 → 1 mod2 → yes.

Pauli condition: S' + L' =3+2=5 → 1 mod2 → yes.

Angular momentum: J_NN' = S' + L' → 3+2=5? Wait, no, J is a vector sum. So the actual J_NN' could be any value from |3-2| to 3+2, which is 1,2,3,4,5.

But X has l=1, so J_X =1 (since X is spin 0).

So J_NN' must be 1 to have vector sum zero. Because J_NN' (vector) + l (vector) =0 → J_NN' = -l. So if l=1, J_NN' must be 1 in the opposite direction.

But J_NN' is S' + L', which can be any value between 1 and 5. So 1 is possible. So this could work.

So option A is allowed.

Option B: Final state is 3S1 → S'=1, L'=0. X is p → l=1.

Parity condition: 0+1=1 → yes.

Pauli condition: 1+0=1 → yes.

Angular momentum: J_NN' = S' + L' → 1 +0 =1.

J_X = l=1.

So J_NN' (1) + J_X (1) could cancel if they are opposite vectors. So possible.

Option B is allowed.

Option C: Final state is 3D3 → S'=1, L'=2. X is f → l=3.

Parity condition: 2+3=5 → 1 → yes.

Pauli condition: 1+2=3 → 1 → yes.

J_NN' =1 +2 =3 (vector).

J_X =3 (but X's spin is 0, so J_X = l=3).

So J_NN' =3, J_X=3. Can they add to zero? Yes, if opposite vectors. So possible.

Option C is allowed.

Option D: Final state is 3P0 → S'=1, L'=1. X is s → l=0.

Parity condition: 1+0=1 → yes.

Pauli condition: 1+1=2 → 0 → no. Because earlier condition says S' + L' ≡ 1 mod2. So for option D, S' + L' =1+1=2 → 0 mod2. Which doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, because T=0 requires S' + L' ≡1 mod2. So if S' + L' is even, which is the case for option D, then it's not allowed.

Wait, let me recalculate. For option D:

Final state: 3P0 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1. L'=P=1.

So S'=1, L'=1.

So S' + L' =2 → 0 mod2.

But the Pauli condition requires T=0 → 0 ≡ (S' + L' +1) mod2 → (S' + L') ≡1 mod2.

So 2 mod2=0 → 0≡1 mod2? No. So this violates the Pauli condition.

So option D is not allowed.

Wait, that's a problem. Because earlier calculation of parity condition for option D said it's allowed, but the Pauli condition is not satisfied.

So according to the Pauli condition, option D is not allowed.

But wait, let me make sure.

Pauli condition: T = S' + L' +1 mod2.

T is given as 0.

So 0 ≡ (S' + L' +1) mod2 → S' + L' +1 must be even → S' + L' must be odd. So for option D, S'=1, L'=1 → sum is 2 → even. So condition not satisfied. So option D is invalid.

But what about the parity condition? It's satisfied.

So the problem is to find which partial wave is not permitted. So which option does not comply with either parity or angular momentum conditions.

Wait, but the question says "make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity". So the correct options must satisfy both.

In option D, the parity condition is satisfied, but the Pauli condition (which is about isospin and hence symmetry) is not. So option D is not allowed.

Wait, but the problem says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

So, the final NN must have T=0, which requires S' + L' +1 ≡0 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

In option D, S' + L' =1 +1=2 → 0 mod2 → which does not satisfy the condition. Hence, option D is not allowed.

But wait, what about the parity of the final state? Let me recalculate.

For option D:

L'=1, l=0 (s state).

Parity condition: L' + l ≡1 mod2.

1 + 0=1 → yes.

So parity is satisfied, but Pauli condition isn't.

So the question asks which partial wave is not permitted due to conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

So the only option that violates a condition is D.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?"

So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli condition for identical fermions. The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state, emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the Pauli condition requires \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Additionally, the parity of the final state must match the initial parity, which is +1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The initial state is \( 1S0 \), meaning \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: The final state consists of the NN system in some state \( (2S'+1)L'J' \) and the emitted particle X. The parity of the final state is given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{NN'} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}}
   \]
   where \( P_{NN'} = (-1)^{L'} \), \( P_X = -1 \) (intrinsic parity of X), and \( L_{\text{emission}} \) is the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN system. The parity condition becomes:
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}} = 1 \implies L' + L_{\text{emission}} + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2)
   \]
   Simplifying, \( L' + L_{\text{emission}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).

3. **Pauli Condition**: For the final NN state with \( T(NN) = 0 \), the Pauli condition requires:
   \[
   T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2)
   \]
   Substituting \( T(NN) = 0 \), we get:
   \[
   S' + L' + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies S' + L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2)
   \]

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial state has \( J = 0 \), so the final state must also have total angular momentum \( J = 0 \). This requires the angular momentum of the NN system (\( J' = S' + L' \)) and the angular momentum of X (\( l \)) to cancel each other vectorially.

### Evaluation of Options:
Each option specifies the final NN state and the orbital angular momentum of X (\( l \)):

#### **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)

- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → Satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: Allowed.

#### **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
- Final NN state: \( 3S1 \implies S' = 1, L' = 0 \)
- X: \( l = 1 \) (denoted by "p").
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → Satisfied.
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → Satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: Allowed.

#### **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
- Final NN state: \( 3D3 \implies S' = 1, L' = 2 \)
- X: \( l = 3 \) (denoted by "f").
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → Satisfied.
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → Satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: Allowed.

#### **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
- Final NN state: \( 3P0 \implies S' = 1, L' = 1 \)
- X: \( l = 0 \) (denoted by "s").
- **Parity Condition**: \( L' + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → Satisfied.
- **Pauli Condition**: \( S' + L' = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) → **Not Satisfied**.
- **Conclusion**: Not Allowed.

### Final Answer:
The only partial wave that violates the Pauli condition is **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
