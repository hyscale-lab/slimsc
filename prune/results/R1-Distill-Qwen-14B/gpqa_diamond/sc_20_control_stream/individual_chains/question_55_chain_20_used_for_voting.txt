Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll try to remember what each peak represents.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically cis and trans isomers. So the structure is probably something like an ester with a double bond in the substituent.

Looking at the NMR data given:

There are four signals:

1. 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz.
2. 5.5 ppm, 1H, a doublet of quadruplets (dq).
3. 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet.
4. 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet.

First, I need to figure out what each of these signals corresponds to in the structure. Let's break it down.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetyl group (OAc) because the acetate ester typically has a singlet for the methyl group adjacent to the oxygen. So that's 3H attached to an oxygen, hence the singlet.

The next one is at 5.5 ppm, 1H, as a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit more complex. This is likely a proton on a double bond. The coupling with multiple protons suggests it's adjacent to two sets of neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton with some coupling.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a pretty high coupling constant. High coupling like that usually suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. Wait, no, wait. The coupling in a trans double bond (trans configuration) would be higher than in cis. But wait, in a double bond, each proton is coupled to the adjacent one. So for example, in a trans double bond, the coupling J might be around 16 Hz because it's trans, leading to a larger coupling. In a cis situation, the coupling is lower, perhaps around 10 Hz or so.

So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, so it's coupled to one proton. That makes me think it's a proton on a double bond, perhaps in a vinyl group. Let's consider the structure.

The options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. Let me think about the structures.

Cis and trans isomers of propenyl acetate would be:

- Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but that's not propenyl; wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, but as an ester, it would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but wait, let's think about the structure.

Wait, acetate is OAc. So propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, that's 1-propenyl acetate. Alternatively, it could be 2-propenyl (allyl) acetate: CH2CH2OAc with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. Alternatively, maybe it's vinyl acetate, but that's a different structure.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. So for propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but if the structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2OAc but with a double bond... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a high coupling, so maybe between two protons that are trans to each other. So perhaps it's a trans double bond.

If the molecule has a trans double bond, the two protons on each end would be trans. So for example, in trans-2-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2OAc with the double bond between the first and second carbons, and the substituents on each end being trans. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that's propenyl. Alternatively, butenyl would have four carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but then the double bond is between 1 and 2. Or perhaps butenyl is between 2 and 3, so CH2CH2CH2CH2OAc with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. So propenyl is three carbons (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), but butenyl would be four carbons (CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc), but the double bond could be between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the possible structures:

Cis-propenyl acetate: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but with the groups on either side of the double bond in cis configuration. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the groups on either end are CH3 (from CH2) and CH2OAc.

Wait, maybe it's better to visualize the possible structures more clearly.

Option C) Cis-propenyl acetate: structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon: at C1, CH3 (from the CH2 group) and a hydrogen. At C2, a CH2OAc and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH3 and CH2OAc. So if the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans), that would affect the NMR.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused because the substituents aren't on the same carbon. Let me think: in propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is:

O
||
OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester is between the CH2 group and the acetate.

But wait, in that case, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2–, attached to the oxygen. So the ester is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

So the protons on the double bond would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but for the NMR, the protons on the double bond would be split into certain patterns.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, J=16 Hz. That suggests that this proton is coupled with another proton with a large coupling constant. Let's see: for a double bond, each proton is coupled with its adjacent proton.

In the case of a trans double bond, the coupling would be larger because the dihedral angle is about 180 degrees, leading to a higher J value, around 16 Hz. If it's cis, the dihedral angle is 0 degrees, but the coupling might be lower, like around 10-12 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, J=16. So this proton is coupled with one other proton, which is trans.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, each of the protons on the double bond would be coupled to each other. So the two protons on the double bond would each be doublets, each coupling with J around 16 Hz.

Wait, but in the NMR data, there are two different peaks in the aromatic region. Wait, no, 7.0 is the only peak in that region. Wait, looking back, the peaks are: 7.0 (1H, d), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

So only one peak in the region of 7.0 and 5.5 ppm. Wait, but that can't be right because in a propenyl group, you have two protons on the double bond. Hmm, unless one of them is split into a more complex pattern.

Wait, maybe the structure is butenyl, which would have more carbons. Let me think about that.

For example, in trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. So, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But wait, that's 1-butenyl. Alternatively, 2-butenyl would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, butenyl can be either 1-butenyl (CH2=CHCH2CH2–) or 2-butenyl (CH2CH2=CHCH2–). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the NMR signals. Let's try to assign each signal.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet at 7.0, J=16 Hz. That's likely a proton that's coupled to one other proton with a large coupling. Let's imagine it's a proton on a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. So it's coupled to two different sets of protons, probably two neighboring groups. Hmm. That could be a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's next to a CH2 group, which in turn is next to another group. For example, maybe a proton that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a vinyl group with more coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an allyl system, where the central proton is coupled to two protons on either side. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond in the middle.

Alternatively, let me think about the options again.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl, cis and trans.

Let me consider each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2OAc, with the substituents on the double bond in cis configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH3 (on C1) and CH2OAc (on C2).

But wait, in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on the double bond are: at C1, CH2 would have two Hs, but wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the structure is:

O
||
OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

No, wait. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is:

O
||
OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the CH2-OAc is attached to C2.

So the protons on the double bond are the CH2 (on C1) and the CH (on C2). Wait, no. Let me correct this.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the substituents on the double bond are CH3 (from C1) and CH2OAc (from C2).

Wait, but the protons on the double bond would be the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the central carbon (C2) is double-bonded to C1, and has a CH2 group attached to C3, which is connected to OAc.

So the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are each CH2 groups. Wait, no: CH2=CHCH2-OAc has C1 as CH2, C2 as CH, and C3 as CH2-OAc. So the protons on C1 are two Hs, and on C2, a CH group (with one H), and on C3, two Hs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to number the carbons properly.

The propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the protons on the double bond are:

- C1: CH2 (two Hs)
- C2: CH (one H)
Wait, no, CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have C1 as CH2, C2 as CH, and C3 as CH2-OAc.

Wait, perhaps the NMR signals would be as follows:

- The C2 proton (the one on the double bond) would be split into a triplet or something because of coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about the NMR data again.

We have two peaks in the 5-7 ppm region: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq).

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a proton that's trans to another proton on a double bond. So each of them would be a doublet with J around 16 Hz. But in the NMR data, only one peak is in that region, the 7.0 ppm. So maybe the other proton is in the same region but integrated as 1H. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the data shows four signals. So for the double bond, there are two protons, but in the spectrum, we have two different signals: 7.0 and 5.5.

Hmm, that suggests that each of the two protons on the double bond is split into a different pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one proton is on a CH2 group and the other on a CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but the protons on the double bond are each part of different environments.

Wait, but in CH2=CHCH2OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2OAc.

So the protons on C1 (CH2) would be split into a quartet due to coupling with C2's proton. The C2 proton (CH) would be split into a triplet due to coupling with C1 and C3. Wait, but C3 is CH2OAc, so maybe the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-OAc connected to a CH2-CH2-CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each option's structure and their expected NMR.

Option A) Cis-butenyl acetate.

Butenyl is four carbons. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But for cis, the substituents on either end of the double bond would be on the same side. So the substituents would be CH2CH2OAc and CH3.

Wait, but butenyl can have the double bond between C1 and C2 (1-butenyl) or between C2 and C3 (2-butenyl). So for cis-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. No, wait, 2-butenyl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents (CH2CH2OAc and CH3) on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

So the NMR for cis-2-butenyl acetate would have protons on the double bond. The C3 proton (on the CH2 group) and the C2 proton (on the CH group) would be split in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the splitting.

In the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet (J=16 Hz) and 5.5 is a dq. Let's imagine that the 7.0 ppm is the C3 proton (if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3). Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, but let me think about the possible structures again.

Option C is cis-propenyl acetate, which is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In this structure, the protons on the double bond are at C1 and C2.

So for C1 (CH2), the protons would be adjacent to a double bond and split by the C2 proton. But since it's a CH2, each proton would be a quartet? Or maybe each is a double doublet.

Wait, no. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with the C2 proton. So each of the two Hs on C1 would be a doublet, but since they're equivalent, the signal would be a quartet.

Wait, but that's for coupling between two CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the C1 protons are split into a triplet due to coupling with the C2 proton.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). That's probably a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, like in an isopropyl group, but more likely a CH(CH3) group. Or perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, 1.6 ppm is a bit upfield for a CH3 attached to a double bond. But perhaps it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, for example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc, but with a double bond nearby.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond. So the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Hmm, but that would be a propenyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. Like in CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Or maybe the methyl is on the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is 3H, doublet. So that's a methyl group attached to a CH2 group which is attached to something else, probably another CH2 or a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's the CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. For example, in the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integration. The 2.1 ppm is a singlet (3H), which is the methyl from the acetate.

The 1.6 ppm is another 3H, perhaps a methyl adjacent to a CH2 group. Alternatively, a CH3 attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2)2CH-OAc, but with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an allylic position. For example, the CH2 group next to a double bond would have a methyl group.

Let me try to think about each option's NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis configuration). So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the CH2OAc on C2 and a CH3 (from C1) on the same side.

In this structure, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C1 protons are next to the double bond, and the C2 has one proton.

So the C1 protons (two Hs) would be adjacent to the C2 proton. So each C1 H would be coupled with the C2 H. Since the C1 has two Hs, each would be a doublet. But since they're equivalent, the overall splitting would be a quartet? Wait, no. No, wait, each H on C1 is coupled to the single H on C2. So each would be a doublet, and since there are two equivalent Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. Wait, no, maybe.

Alternatively, the C1 protons would be split into a doublet due to coupling with the C2 proton. Since the two Hs are equivalent, the signal would be a triplet. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The C2 proton in CH2=CHCH2OAc is a CH group with one H. It's adjacent to two CH2 groups. So it would couple with the two Hs on C1 and the two Hs on C3.

Wait, but in a trans configuration, the coupling would be larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the C2 proton in propenyl acetate would be split into a quartet because it's coupled with two Hs on C1 and two on C3. Or perhaps a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the protons on the double bond.

In a trans configuration, the coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be higher. So the C2 proton would be a doublet with J around 16 Hz (trans). But in the given NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. So that could match.

Then, what about the other protons on the double bond, the C1 protons?

In this case, the C1 has two Hs. They are each coupled with the C2 H. So each would be a doublet, but since there are two equivalent Hs, the splitting would be a quartet. Wait, no. Wait, each H on C1 is coupled to one H on C2, so each would be a doublet. But since they're equivalent, their combined signal would be a quartet? No, wait, when two equivalent Hs are coupled to another H, each would be a doublet, but the splitting would be a triplet. Because each H on C1 is coupled to the single H on C2, so each would be a doublet, but with two equivalent Hs, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data again. We have a peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That suggests that this proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant.

So, perhaps this is the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C1 protons (two Hs) and the C3 protons (two Hs). So each coupling would cause a split. So the C2 proton would have two couplings: one with J1 and another with J2, resulting in a doublet of doublets. But the data shows it as a dq (doublet of quadruplets), which suggests four peaks, which would come from coupling with two different sets of protons, each with two Hs.

Wait, perhaps the C2 proton is coupled to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So the C2 proton would have two different coupling constants, leading to a quartet of quartets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a CH group that's coupled to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm doublet is 3H. So that's a methyl group attached to a CH2. The CH2 would be attached to another group, perhaps a double bond.

So if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is on a CH which is attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(OAc)CH2CH3. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)OAc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about the options again.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc with trans configuration. Wait, but in a propenyl group, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH3 and CH2OAc. So in trans, they are opposite each other.

In that case, the C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to the two Hs on C1 (CH2) and the two Hs on C3 (CH2OAc).

So the C2 proton would be a quartet due to coupling with two Hs on each side. But in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which is more complex than a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the C3 proton, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should consider the integration of the peaks. The 7.0 ppm is 1H, and 5.5 ppm is 1H. So the double bond must have two Hs, but each is split into different signals.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, the double bond has two Hs: one on C1 (CH2) and one on C2 (CH). So in the NMR, the C2 H would be split more than the C1 Hs.

Wait, maybe in the structure, the C2 H is coupled to both the C1 Hs and the C3 Hs. So the C2 H would be a quartet (coupled with two Hs on C1 and two on C3), but in the data, it's a doublet of quadruplets, which is a four-line split.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the C2 H, which is coupled to two different sets of protons: one with J= some value and another with a different J. So the splitting would create multiple peaks.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond. So the structure might be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc with a double bond. For example, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that would be a different structure.

Wait, but in that case, the methyl group (CH(CH3)) would be adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond. So the methyl's CH would be split due to coupling with the double bond's protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is on the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Each has a double bond, either between carbons 1-2 (propenyl) or 2-3 (butenyl), and the substituents are cis or trans.

The NMR data has a singlet at 2.1 ppm (OAc's CH3), a doublet at 7.0 (J=16 Hz), a dq at 5.5, and a doublet at 1.6 (3H).

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. So the structure could be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that's a propenyl group with a branch. Wait, but that would change the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that's butenyl.

Wait, but butenyl would have four carbons. So in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then the CH2CH2OAc would have a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, but then the NMR would show the protons on the double bond as CH2 and CH groups. The CH2 protons would be split by the CH on the double bond, and the CH would be split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps in that structure, the CH2 protons (C1) would be a quartet, and the CH (C2) would be a triplet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the 1.6 ppm peak as the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond and a methyl group. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would make it a substituted propenyl group.

In that case, the CH(CH3) would be adjacent to the double bond. The methyl (CH3) would be on a CH group, which is adjacent to the double bond.

So the CH(CH3) would have a proton that's coupled to the double bond's protons. That proton (on CH(CH3)) would be split into a doublet due to coupling with the double bond's Hs. The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH group.

Wait, but then the 5.5 ppm dq would be the CH group's proton, which is coupled to the double bond's CH2 and perhaps another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

In that structure, the CH(CH3) is adjacent to the double bond. So the proton on the CH(CH3) would be coupled to the Hs on the double bond (C2).

So the CH(CH3) proton would be a doublet (coupled with two Hs on C2?), but wait, the C2 in this structure would be CH2, I think.

Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–OAc.

So C1: CH2, C2: CH, C3: CH(CH3), C4: OAc.

Wait, but that would make it a butenyl group with four carbons. So it's butenyl acetate, not propenyl.

Wait, that would make it butenyl. So perhaps the correct structure is butenyl acetate with a substituent, leading to the NMR signals.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc with trans configuration. So the substituents on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be CH2CH2OAc and CH3. In trans, these substituents are on opposite sides.

In this structure, the C2 proton (on the double bond) would be a CH, coupled with the C1 CH2 and the C3 CH2.

So the C2 proton would have coupling with two Hs on C1 and two on C3, leading to a quartet of quartets, which could appear as a doublet of quadruplets.

That would match the 5.5 ppm dq.

The C1 protons (CH2) would be coupled with the C2 CH, so each would be a doublet. But since there are two Hs, they would form a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is 1H, so perhaps that's the C2 proton.

The C1 CH2 would have a triplet around 5.5 or maybe higher. Alternatively, perhaps the C1 CH2 is around 5.5, but that doesn't fit because the 5.5 is a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C1 CH2 being split into a doublet due to coupling with the C2 CH.

But I'm not quite sure.

Another approach: the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which suggests a trans coupling. So that's likely a proton on a trans double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests a proton that's coupled to two different sets of two Hs each.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc (trans configuration). The C2 proton (CH) would be coupled with the CH2 on C1 and the CH2 on C3. So each coupling would be a doublet, but with two different J values, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

The C1 CH2 would be coupled with the C2 CH, so each H would be a doublet, but since there are two Hs, the signal would be a triplet. So the triplet would appear around 5.5 or 6.0 ppm.

But in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, and the 7.0 is a doublet.

Hmm, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH in a trans configuration, which is coupled with the C1 CH2, giving a J of 16 Hz. The C1 CH2 would then be a quartet, but that's not matching the data.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH, which is coupled to the C1 CH2 with J=16 Hz, making it a doublet. Then the C1 CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the C2 CH and perhaps another group.

Wait, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (trans configuration), which is trans-propenyl acetate (option B).

In that case, the C2 CH would be coupled with the C1 CH2, leading to a quartet (since two Hs on C1). But in the NMR, the 5.5 is a dq, which is more complex than a quartet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the integration.

The 7.0 ppm is 1H, the 5.5 is 1H, 2.1 is 3H, and 1.6 is 3H.

So the structure must have two double bond protons, each in different environments. So each is a different signal in the NMR.

In cis-propenyl acetate (option C), the two protons on the double bond would be in different environments because of the cis arrangement, leading to different chemical shifts. So the C1 CH2 would be split into a triplet, and the C2 CH would be a quartet or something else.

Alternatively, in trans configuration, the C2 CH would be a doublet, which could explain the 7.0 ppm peak.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH in trans configuration, coupled with the C1 CH2, and the 5.5 ppm is the C3 CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C1 CH2 in trans configuration, coupled with the C2 CH, giving a doublet with J=16 Hz. Then the C2 CH would have a more complex coupling.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, which is 3H. So perhaps that's a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the structure.

Putting it all together, I'm starting to think that the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, why? Because the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which would be a trans coupling. So the double bond must be in a trans configuration, which would be either option B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If the structure is trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the C2 CH would be coupled with the C1 CH2, resulting in a quartet for the C2 CH. But the NMR shows 5.5 as a dq, which is more splitting than a quartet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have the double bond between C2 and C3, making the protons on C2 and C3 each coupled with two Hs on adjacent CH2 groups.

So the C3 CH would be coupled with the C2 CH and the C4 CH2, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the 1.6 ppm peak again. It's a doublet, 3H. So perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond.

In trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2OAc, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2=CH-CH2OAc.

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me correct the structure.

In trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2OAc, with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents (CH2 and CH2OAc) on opposite sides.

In that structure, the C3 CH would be adjacent to the C2 CH. So the C3 CH would have protons that are coupled with the C2 CH and perhaps the C4 CH2.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a 1.6 ppm doublet, which is 3H. So maybe the structure has a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would be a substituted propenyl group, which might not be one of the options.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think I should try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, suggesting a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests coupling with two different groups.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, which is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2.

Putting it all together, the structure is likely a trans configuration with a butenyl group, because that would have more CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond, leading to more complex couplings.

So among the options, D is trans-butenyl acetate, which would have the double bond in the middle, leading to the 7.0 ppm as a trans-coupled proton and the 5.5 as a more complex coupling.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but the J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling, so perhaps the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, given that, I think the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because the J=16 Hz is for a trans coupling. So if the structure is cis, the J would be lower.

Wait, that makes sense. So a trans coupling would have higher J, around 16 Hz, while cis would have lower, around 10-12 Hz.

So in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which implies a trans configuration. So the correct answer must be either option B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

Looking at the options, option B is trans-propenyl acetate. If the structure is trans-propenyl, the C2 CH would be a doublet with J=16 Hz, matching the 7.0 ppm peak.

The C1 CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the C2 CH. But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which might fit.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but in trans-propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc in trans configuration. So the C2 CH would be coupled with the C1 CH2, leading to a quartet for C2 and a triplet for C1.

But the data shows 5.5 ppm as a dq, which is more than a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given the J=16 Hz, the structure must be trans. So the options are B and D.

Between those, option B is trans-propenyl, and D is trans-butenyl.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H, which could be a methyl attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond. So in trans-butenyl, the structure would have more CH2 groups, perhaps leading to the 1.6 ppm peak.

Alternatively, the 1.6 ppm could be the CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps in trans-butenyl acetate, the structure is CH2-CH=CH-CH2OAc. So the CH2 groups are on either end of the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 groups would have their protons split by the adjacent CH.

So the CH2 next to the double bond (C3) would have protons that are split into a quartet due to coupling with the C2 CH.

The C2 CH would be split into a triplet due to coupling with C1 CH2 and C3 CH2.

But the NMR data has a 5.5 ppm as a dq, which could correspond to the C2 CH.

The 7.0 ppm would be the C3 CH, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), the two protons on the double bond (C2 and C3) would each be coupled with two CH2 groups.

So the C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH, leading to a quartet of quartets, which could appear as a dq.

The C3 CH would be coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2, leading to another dq.

So in the NMR, both C2 and C3 would show as dq, but in the data, we have only one dq at 5.5 ppm and a doublet at 7.0.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is C3 CH in trans configuration, which is coupled with C2 CH, giving a doublet with J=16 Hz.

Then the C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH, leading to a more complex splitting, like a dq at 5.5 ppm.

The 1.6 ppm would be the C4 CH2 group's CH3.

Wait, but butenyl has four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2OAc.

So the CH2OAc is on C4.

So the C4 is CH2OAc. The C3 is CH, adjacent to the double bond.

The C3 CH would be coupled with C2 CH and the C4 CH2.

So the C3 CH would be a doublet (coupled with C2 CH) and a quartet (coupled with C4 CH2), leading to a doublet of quartets, which would be a dq.

The C4 CH2 would be split into a triplet due to coupling with C3 CH.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a dq (1H), which would correspond to the C3 CH.

The C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH, leading to a quartet of quartets, which would be a dq, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH, which is coupled with C3 CH (J=16 Hz), making it a doublet.

The C3 CH would be coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2, leading to a dq at 5.5 ppm.

The C1 CH2 would be coupled with C2 CH, giving a quartet.

The C4 CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with C3 CH.

And the 1.6 ppm would be the C4 CH2's CH3, but wait, no, the C4 is CH2OAc, which is a singlet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to map each peak.

In trans-butenyl acetate (option D):

- C1: CH2
- C2: CH
- C3: CH
- C4: CH2-OAc

The NMR would have:

- C4 CH2: adjacent to C3 CH. The CH2 would be split into a triplet (coupled with C3 CH).
- C3 CH: coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2. So it would be a doublet of quartets (dq), around 5.5 ppm.
- C2 CH: coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH. So it would be a quartet of quartets, but perhaps appears as a doublet if only one coupling is significant.
- C1 CH2: coupled with C2 CH, leading to a quartet.

The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz would be the C2 CH, coupled with C3 CH.

The 5.5 ppm dq would be the C3 CH, coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2.

The 1.6 ppm doublet would be the C4 CH2's CH3, but wait, C4 is CH2-OAc, which doesn't have a CH3. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is from another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc (trans configuration), making it trans-1-butenyl acetate. In this case, the C1 CH2 would be coupled with the C2 CH, giving a quartet. The C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH2, leading to a dq. The C3 CH2 would be coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2OAc, perhaps leading to a triplet.

But I'm not matching the 1.6 ppm doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond, like in CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would be a branch, which may not be one of the options.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on the J=16 Hz, which indicates a trans coupling, the correct answer is likely either option B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

Given that the NMR has a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl attached to a CH2, perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate, where the CH2 adjacent to the double bond is attached to a methyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with option C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but I'm not confident.

Wait, no. Because the J=16 Hz suggests trans, so option C is cis, which would have lower J. So the correct answer must be either B or D.

Since the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond, which would fit a butenyl group.

So I'll choose option D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its ¹H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically cis and trans isomers. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester (-OAc), which is a common feature in esters and appears as a singlet due to the absence of neighboring protons.

2. **The doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a proton coupled to another proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). This suggests a trans configuration in a double bond, as trans couplings typically exhibit larger J values compared to cis couplings.

3. **The doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** suggests a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely from adjacent CH₂ groups. This pattern is consistent with a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to two CH₂ groups.

4. **The doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)** corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH₂ group, which is likely adjacent to a double bond. This is a common feature in allylic or vinyl systems.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate**  
  In a cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between protons on the double bond would be smaller (typically around 10–12 Hz) due to the cis dihedral angle. The observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm contradicts this, making this option unlikely.

- **Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate**  
  The structure of trans-propenyl acetate is CH₂=CHCH₂OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2, with the substituents (CH₃ and CH₂OAc) in a trans configuration. The C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to the C1 CH₂ group, and the C1 CH₂ protons would be coupled to the C2 CH proton. However, the NMR data shows a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm, which is more complex than expected for a simple propenyl system. This makes trans-propenyl acetate less likely.

- **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate**  
  In a cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between protons on the double bond would be smaller (around 10–12 Hz). The observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm is inconsistent with a cis configuration, ruling out this option.

- **Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate**  
  The structure of trans-butenyl acetate is CH₃CH=CHCH₂OAc, with the double bond between C2 and C3 in a trans configuration. The C3 proton (CH) would be coupled to the C2 CH and C4 CH₂ groups, leading to a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. The C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to the C1 CH₂ and C3 CH groups, appearing as a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J = 16 Hz. The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to the CH₃ group on C1, which is adjacent to the CH₂ group. This matches the NMR data well, making trans-butenyl acetate the most likely structure.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data, particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the splitting patterns, strongly support a trans configuration. Among the options, **trans-butenyl acetate** best matches the observed data.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll try to remember what each peak represents.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically cis and trans isomers. So the structure is probably something like an ester with a double bond in the substituent.

Looking at the NMR data given:

There are four signals:

1. 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz.
2. 5.5 ppm, 1H, a doublet of quadruplets (dq).
3. 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet.
4. 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet.

First, I need to figure out what each of these signals corresponds to in the structure. Let's break it down.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetyl group (OAc) because the acetate ester typically has a singlet for the methyl group adjacent to the oxygen. So that's 3H attached to an oxygen, hence the singlet.

The next one is at 5.5 ppm, 1H, as a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit more complex. This is likely a proton on a double bond. The coupling with multiple protons suggests it's adjacent to two sets of neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton with some coupling.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a pretty high coupling constant. High coupling like that usually suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. Wait, no, wait. The coupling in a trans double bond (trans configuration) would be higher than in cis. But wait, in a double bond, each proton is coupled to the adjacent one. So for example, in a trans double bond, the coupling J might be around 16 Hz because it's trans, leading to a larger coupling. In a cis situation, the coupling is lower, perhaps around 10 Hz or so.

So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, so it's coupled to one proton. That makes me think it's a proton on a double bond, perhaps in a vinyl group. Let's consider the structure.

The options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. Let me think about the structures.

Cis and trans isomers of propenyl acetate would be:

- Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but that's not propenyl; wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, but as an ester, it would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but wait, let's think about the structure.

Wait, acetate is OAc. So propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, that's 1-propenyl acetate. Alternatively, it could be 2-propenyl (allyl) acetate: CH2CH2OAc with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. Alternatively, maybe it's vinyl acetate, but that's a different structure.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. So for propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but if the structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2OAc but with a double bond... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a high coupling, so maybe between two protons that are trans to each other. So perhaps it's a trans double bond.

If the molecule has a trans double bond, the two protons on each end would be trans. So for example, in trans-2-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2OAc with the double bond between the first and second carbons, and the substituents on each end being trans. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that's propenyl. Alternatively, butenyl would have four carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but then the double bond is between 1 and 2. Or perhaps butenyl is between 2 and 3, so CH2CH2CH2CH2OAc with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. So propenyl is three carbons (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), but butenyl would be four carbons (CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc), but the double bond could be between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the possible structures:

Cis-propenyl acetate: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but with the groups on either side of the double bond in cis configuration. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the groups on either end are CH3 (from CH2) and CH2OAc.

Wait, maybe it's better to visualize the possible structures more clearly.

Option C) Cis-propenyl acetate: structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon: at C1, CH3 (from the CH2 group) and a hydrogen. At C2, a CH2OAc and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH3 and CH2OAc. So if the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans), that would affect the NMR.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused because the substituents aren't on the same carbon. Let me think: in propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is:

O
||
OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester is between the CH2 group and the acetate.

But wait, in that case, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2–, attached to the oxygen. So the ester is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

So the protons on the double bond would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but for the NMR, the protons on the double bond would be split into certain patterns.

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, J=16 Hz. That suggests that this proton is coupled with another proton with a large coupling constant. Let's see: for a double bond, each proton is coupled with its adjacent proton.

In the case of a trans double bond, the coupling would be larger because the dihedral angle is about 180 degrees, leading to a higher J value, around 16 Hz. If it's cis, the dihedral angle is 0 degrees, but the coupling might be lower, like around 10-12 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, J=16. So this proton is coupled with one other proton, which is trans.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, each of the protons on the double bond would be coupled to each other. So the two protons on the double bond would each be doublets, each coupling with J around 16 Hz.

Wait, but in the NMR data, there are two different peaks in the aromatic region. Wait, no, 7.0 is the only peak in that region. Wait, looking back, the peaks are: 7.0 (1H, d), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

So only one peak in the region of 7.0 and 5.5 ppm. Wait, but that can't be right because in a propenyl group, you have two protons on the double bond. Hmm, unless one of them is split into a more complex pattern.

Wait, maybe the structure is butenyl, which would have more carbons. Let me think about that.

For example, in trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. So, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But wait, that's 1-butenyl. Alternatively, 2-butenyl would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, butenyl can be either 1-butenyl (CH2=CHCH2CH2–) or 2-butenyl (CH2CH2=CHCH2–). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the NMR signals. Let's try to assign each signal.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet at 7.0, J=16 Hz. That's likely a proton that's coupled to one other proton with a large coupling. Let's imagine it's a proton on a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. So it's coupled to two different sets of protons, probably two neighboring groups. Hmm. That could be a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's next to a CH2 group, which in turn is next to another group. For example, maybe a proton that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a vinyl group with more coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an allyl system, where the central proton is coupled to two protons on either side. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond in the middle.

Alternatively, let me think about the options again.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl, cis and trans.

Let me consider each option's expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2OAc, with the substituents on the double bond in cis configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH3 (on C1) and CH2OAc (on C2).

But wait, in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on the double bond are: at C1, CH2 would have two Hs, but wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the structure is:

O
||
OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

No, wait. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is:

O
||
OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the CH2-OAc is attached to C2.

So the protons on the double bond are the CH2 (on C1) and the CH (on C2). Wait, no. Let me correct this.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the substituents on the double bond are CH3 (from C1) and CH2OAc (from C2).

Wait, but the protons on the double bond would be the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the central carbon (C2) is double-bonded to C1, and has a CH2 group attached to C3, which is connected to OAc.

So the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are each CH2 groups. Wait, no: CH2=CHCH2-OAc has C1 as CH2, C2 as CH, and C3 as CH2-OAc. So the protons on C1 are two Hs, and on C2, a CH group (with one H), and on C3, two Hs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to number the carbons properly.

The propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the protons on the double bond are:

- C1: CH2 (two Hs)
- C2: CH (one H)
Wait, no, CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have C1 as CH2, C2 as CH, and C3 as CH2-OAc.

Wait, perhaps the NMR signals would be as follows:

- The C2 proton (the one on the double bond) would be split into a triplet or something because of coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about the NMR data again.

We have two peaks in the 5-7 ppm region: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq).

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a proton that's trans to another proton on a double bond. So each of them would be a doublet with J around 16 Hz. But in the NMR data, only one peak is in that region, the 7.0 ppm. So maybe the other proton is in the same region but integrated as 1H. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the data shows four signals. So for the double bond, there are two protons, but in the spectrum, we have two different signals: 7.0 and 5.5.

Hmm, that suggests that each of the two protons on the double bond is split into a different pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one proton is on a CH2 group and the other on a CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but the protons on the double bond are each part of different environments.

Wait, but in CH2=CHCH2OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2OAc.

So the protons on C1 (CH2) would be split into a quartet due to coupling with C2's proton. The C2 proton (CH) would be split into a triplet due to coupling with C1 and C3. Wait, but C3 is CH2OAc, so maybe the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-OAc connected to a CH2-CH2-CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each option's structure and their expected NMR.

Option A) Cis-butenyl acetate.

Butenyl is four carbons. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But for cis, the substituents on either end of the double bond would be on the same side. So the substituents would be CH2CH2OAc and CH3.

Wait, but butenyl can have the double bond between C1 and C2 (1-butenyl) or between C2 and C3 (2-butenyl). So for cis-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. No, wait, 2-butenyl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents (CH2CH2OAc and CH3) on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

So the NMR for cis-2-butenyl acetate would have protons on the double bond. The C3 proton (on the CH2 group) and the C2 proton (on the CH group) would be split in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the splitting.

In the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet (J=16 Hz) and 5.5 is a dq. Let's imagine that the 7.0 ppm is the C3 proton (if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3). Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, but let me think about the possible structures again.

Option C is cis-propenyl acetate, which is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In this structure, the protons on the double bond are at C1 and C2.

So for C1 (CH2), the protons would be adjacent to a double bond and split by the C2 proton. But since it's a CH2, each proton would be a quartet? Or maybe each is a double doublet.

Wait, no. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with the C2 proton. So each of the two Hs on C1 would be a doublet, but since they're equivalent, the signal would be a quartet.

Wait, but that's for coupling between two CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the C1 protons are split into a triplet due to coupling with the C2 proton.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). That's probably a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, like in an isopropyl group, but more likely a CH(CH3) group. Or perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, 1.6 ppm is a bit upfield for a CH3 attached to a double bond. But perhaps it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, for example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc, but with a double bond nearby.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond. So the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Hmm, but that would be a propenyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. Like in CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Or maybe the methyl is on the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is 3H, doublet. So that's a methyl group attached to a CH2 group which is attached to something else, probably another CH2 or a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's the CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. For example, in the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integration. The 2.1 ppm is a singlet (3H), which is the methyl from the acetate.

The 1.6 ppm is another 3H, perhaps a methyl adjacent to a CH2 group. Alternatively, a CH3 attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2)2CH-OAc, but with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an allylic position. For example, the CH2 group next to a double bond would have a methyl group.

Let me try to think about each option's NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis configuration). So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the CH2OAc on C2 and a CH3 (from C1) on the same side.

In this structure, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C1 protons are next to the double bond, and the C2 has one proton.

So the C1 protons (two Hs) would be adjacent to the C2 proton. So each C1 H would be coupled with the C2 H. Since the C1 has two Hs, each would be a doublet. But since they're equivalent, the overall splitting would be a quartet? Wait, no. No, wait, each H on C1 is coupled to the single H on C2. So each would be a doublet, and since there are two equivalent Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. Wait, no, maybe.

Alternatively, the C1 protons would be split into a doublet due to coupling with the C2 proton. Since the two Hs are equivalent, the signal would be a triplet. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The C2 proton in CH2=CHCH2OAc is a CH group with one H. It's adjacent to two CH2 groups. So it would couple with the two Hs on C1 and the two Hs on C3.

Wait, but in a trans configuration, the coupling would be larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the C2 proton in propenyl acetate would be split into a quartet because it's coupled with two Hs on C1 and two on C3. Or perhaps a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the protons on the double bond.

In a trans configuration, the coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be higher. So the C2 proton would be a doublet with J around 16 Hz (trans). But in the given NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. So that could match.

Then, what about the other protons on the double bond, the C1 protons?

In this case, the C1 has two Hs. They are each coupled with the C2 H. So each would be a doublet, but since there are two equivalent Hs, the splitting would be a quartet. Wait, no. Wait, each H on C1 is coupled to one H on C2, so each would be a doublet. But since they're equivalent, their combined signal would be a quartet? No, wait, when two equivalent Hs are coupled to another H, each would be a doublet, but the splitting would be a triplet. Because each H on C1 is coupled to the single H on C2, so each would be a doublet, but with two equivalent Hs, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data again. We have a peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That suggests that this proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant.

So, perhaps this is the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C1 protons (two Hs) and the C3 protons (two Hs). So each coupling would cause a split. So the C2 proton would have two couplings: one with J1 and another with J2, resulting in a doublet of doublets. But the data shows it as a dq (doublet of quadruplets), which suggests four peaks, which would come from coupling with two different sets of protons, each with two Hs.

Wait, perhaps the C2 proton is coupled to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So the C2 proton would have two different coupling constants, leading to a quartet of quartets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a CH group that's coupled to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm doublet is 3H. So that's a methyl group attached to a CH2. The CH2 would be attached to another group, perhaps a double bond.

So if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is on a CH which is attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(OAc)CH2CH3. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)OAc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about the options again.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc with trans configuration. Wait, but in a propenyl group, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH3 and CH2OAc. So in trans, they are opposite each other.

In that case, the C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to the two Hs on C1 (CH2) and the two Hs on C3 (CH2OAc).

So the C2 proton would be a quartet due to coupling with two Hs on each side. But in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which is more complex than a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the C3 proton, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should consider the integration of the peaks. The 7.0 ppm is 1H, and 5.5 ppm is 1H. So the double bond must have two Hs, but each is split into different signals.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, the double bond has two Hs: one on C1 (CH2) and one on C2 (CH). So in the NMR, the C2 H would be split more than the C1 Hs.

Wait, maybe in the structure, the C2 H is coupled to both the C1 Hs and the C3 Hs. So the C2 H would be a quartet (coupled with two Hs on C1 and two on C3), but in the data, it's a doublet of quadruplets, which is a four-line split.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the C2 H, which is coupled to two different sets of protons: one with J= some value and another with a different J. So the splitting would create multiple peaks.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond. So the structure might be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc with a double bond. For example, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. But that would be a different structure.

Wait, but in that case, the methyl group (CH(CH3)) would be adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond. So the methyl's CH would be split due to coupling with the double bond's protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is on the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Each has a double bond, either between carbons 1-2 (propenyl) or 2-3 (butenyl), and the substituents are cis or trans.

The NMR data has a singlet at 2.1 ppm (OAc's CH3), a doublet at 7.0 (J=16 Hz), a dq at 5.5, and a doublet at 1.6 (3H).

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. So the structure could be CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that's a propenyl group with a branch. Wait, but that would change the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, but that's butenyl.

Wait, but butenyl would have four carbons. So in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. Then the CH2CH2OAc would have a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, but then the NMR would show the protons on the double bond as CH2 and CH groups. The CH2 protons would be split by the CH on the double bond, and the CH would be split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps in that structure, the CH2 protons (C1) would be a quartet, and the CH (C2) would be a triplet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the 1.6 ppm peak as the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond and a methyl group. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would make it a substituted propenyl group.

In that case, the CH(CH3) would be adjacent to the double bond. The methyl (CH3) would be on a CH group, which is adjacent to the double bond.

So the CH(CH3) would have a proton that's coupled to the double bond's protons. That proton (on CH(CH3)) would be split into a doublet due to coupling with the double bond's Hs. The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH group.

Wait, but then the 5.5 ppm dq would be the CH group's proton, which is coupled to the double bond's CH2 and perhaps another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc.

In that structure, the CH(CH3) is adjacent to the double bond. So the proton on the CH(CH3) would be coupled to the Hs on the double bond (C2).

So the CH(CH3) proton would be a doublet (coupled with two Hs on C2?), but wait, the C2 in this structure would be CH2, I think.

Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–OAc.

So C1: CH2, C2: CH, C3: CH(CH3), C4: OAc.

Wait, but that would make it a butenyl group with four carbons. So it's butenyl acetate, not propenyl.

Wait, that would make it butenyl. So perhaps the correct structure is butenyl acetate with a substituent, leading to the NMR signals.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc with trans configuration. So the substituents on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be CH2CH2OAc and CH3. In trans, these substituents are on opposite sides.

In this structure, the C2 proton (on the double bond) would be a CH, coupled with the C1 CH2 and the C3 CH2.

So the C2 proton would have coupling with two Hs on C1 and two on C3, leading to a quartet of quartets, which could appear as a doublet of quadruplets.

That would match the 5.5 ppm dq.

The C1 protons (CH2) would be coupled with the C2 CH, so each would be a doublet. But since there are two Hs, they would form a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is 1H, so perhaps that's the C2 proton.

The C1 CH2 would have a triplet around 5.5 or maybe higher. Alternatively, perhaps the C1 CH2 is around 5.5, but that doesn't fit because the 5.5 is a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C1 CH2 being split into a doublet due to coupling with the C2 CH.

But I'm not quite sure.

Another approach: the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which suggests a trans coupling. So that's likely a proton on a trans double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests a proton that's coupled to two different sets of two Hs each.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc (trans configuration). The C2 proton (CH) would be coupled with the CH2 on C1 and the CH2 on C3. So each coupling would be a doublet, but with two different J values, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

The C1 CH2 would be coupled with the C2 CH, so each H would be a doublet, but since there are two Hs, the signal would be a triplet. So the triplet would appear around 5.5 or 6.0 ppm.

But in the data, the 5.5 is a dq, and the 7.0 is a doublet.

Hmm, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH in a trans configuration, which is coupled with the C1 CH2, giving a J of 16 Hz. The C1 CH2 would then be a quartet, but that's not matching the data.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH, which is coupled to the C1 CH2 with J=16 Hz, making it a doublet. Then the C1 CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the C2 CH and perhaps another group.

Wait, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (trans configuration), which is trans-propenyl acetate (option B).

In that case, the C2 CH would be coupled with the C1 CH2, leading to a quartet (since two Hs on C1). But in the NMR, the 5.5 is a dq, which is more complex than a quartet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the integration.

The 7.0 ppm is 1H, the 5.5 is 1H, 2.1 is 3H, and 1.6 is 3H.

So the structure must have two double bond protons, each in different environments. So each is a different signal in the NMR.

In cis-propenyl acetate (option C), the two protons on the double bond would be in different environments because of the cis arrangement, leading to different chemical shifts. So the C1 CH2 would be split into a triplet, and the C2 CH would be a quartet or something else.

Alternatively, in trans configuration, the C2 CH would be a doublet, which could explain the 7.0 ppm peak.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH in trans configuration, coupled with the C1 CH2, and the 5.5 ppm is the C3 CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C1 CH2 in trans configuration, coupled with the C2 CH, giving a doublet with J=16 Hz. Then the C2 CH would have a more complex coupling.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, which is 3H. So perhaps that's a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the structure.

Putting it all together, I'm starting to think that the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, why? Because the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which would be a trans coupling. So the double bond must be in a trans configuration, which would be either option B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If the structure is trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the C2 CH would be coupled with the C1 CH2, resulting in a quartet for the C2 CH. But the NMR shows 5.5 as a dq, which is more splitting than a quartet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have the double bond between C2 and C3, making the protons on C2 and C3 each coupled with two Hs on adjacent CH2 groups.

So the C3 CH would be coupled with the C2 CH and the C4 CH2, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the 1.6 ppm peak again. It's a doublet, 3H. So perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond.

In trans-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2OAc, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2=CH-CH2OAc.

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me correct the structure.

In trans-2-butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2OAc, with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents (CH2 and CH2OAc) on opposite sides.

In that structure, the C3 CH would be adjacent to the C2 CH. So the C3 CH would have protons that are coupled with the C2 CH and perhaps the C4 CH2.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a 1.6 ppm doublet, which is 3H. So maybe the structure has a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would be a substituted propenyl group, which might not be one of the options.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think I should try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, suggesting a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests coupling with two different groups.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, which is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2.

Putting it all together, the structure is likely a trans configuration with a butenyl group, because that would have more CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond, leading to more complex couplings.

So among the options, D is trans-butenyl acetate, which would have the double bond in the middle, leading to the 7.0 ppm as a trans-coupled proton and the 5.5 as a more complex coupling.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but the J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling, so perhaps the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, given that, I think the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because the J=16 Hz is for a trans coupling. So if the structure is cis, the J would be lower.

Wait, that makes sense. So a trans coupling would have higher J, around 16 Hz, while cis would have lower, around 10-12 Hz.

So in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which implies a trans configuration. So the correct answer must be either option B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

Looking at the options, option B is trans-propenyl acetate. If the structure is trans-propenyl, the C2 CH would be a doublet with J=16 Hz, matching the 7.0 ppm peak.

The C1 CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the C2 CH. But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which might fit.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but in trans-propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc in trans configuration. So the C2 CH would be coupled with the C1 CH2, leading to a quartet for C2 and a triplet for C1.

But the data shows 5.5 ppm as a dq, which is more than a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given the J=16 Hz, the structure must be trans. So the options are B and D.

Between those, option B is trans-propenyl, and D is trans-butenyl.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H, which could be a methyl attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond. So in trans-butenyl, the structure would have more CH2 groups, perhaps leading to the 1.6 ppm peak.

Alternatively, the 1.6 ppm could be the CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps in trans-butenyl acetate, the structure is CH2-CH=CH-CH2OAc. So the CH2 groups are on either end of the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 groups would have their protons split by the adjacent CH.

So the CH2 next to the double bond (C3) would have protons that are split into a quartet due to coupling with the C2 CH.

The C2 CH would be split into a triplet due to coupling with C1 CH2 and C3 CH2.

But the NMR data has a 5.5 ppm as a dq, which could correspond to the C2 CH.

The 7.0 ppm would be the C3 CH, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), the two protons on the double bond (C2 and C3) would each be coupled with two CH2 groups.

So the C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH, leading to a quartet of quartets, which could appear as a dq.

The C3 CH would be coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2, leading to another dq.

So in the NMR, both C2 and C3 would show as dq, but in the data, we have only one dq at 5.5 ppm and a doublet at 7.0.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is C3 CH in trans configuration, which is coupled with C2 CH, giving a doublet with J=16 Hz.

Then the C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH, leading to a more complex splitting, like a dq at 5.5 ppm.

The 1.6 ppm would be the C4 CH2 group's CH3.

Wait, but butenyl has four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2OAc.

So the CH2OAc is on C4.

So the C4 is CH2OAc. The C3 is CH, adjacent to the double bond.

The C3 CH would be coupled with C2 CH and the C4 CH2.

So the C3 CH would be a doublet (coupled with C2 CH) and a quartet (coupled with C4 CH2), leading to a doublet of quartets, which would be a dq.

The C4 CH2 would be split into a triplet due to coupling with C3 CH.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a dq (1H), which would correspond to the C3 CH.

The C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH, leading to a quartet of quartets, which would be a dq, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, the 7.0 ppm is the C2 CH, which is coupled with C3 CH (J=16 Hz), making it a doublet.

The C3 CH would be coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2, leading to a dq at 5.5 ppm.

The C1 CH2 would be coupled with C2 CH, giving a quartet.

The C4 CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with C3 CH.

And the 1.6 ppm would be the C4 CH2's CH3, but wait, no, the C4 is CH2OAc, which is a singlet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to map each peak.

In trans-butenyl acetate (option D):

- C1: CH2
- C2: CH
- C3: CH
- C4: CH2-OAc

The NMR would have:

- C4 CH2: adjacent to C3 CH. The CH2 would be split into a triplet (coupled with C3 CH).
- C3 CH: coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2. So it would be a doublet of quartets (dq), around 5.5 ppm.
- C2 CH: coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH. So it would be a quartet of quartets, but perhaps appears as a doublet if only one coupling is significant.
- C1 CH2: coupled with C2 CH, leading to a quartet.

The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz would be the C2 CH, coupled with C3 CH.

The 5.5 ppm dq would be the C3 CH, coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2.

The 1.6 ppm doublet would be the C4 CH2's CH3, but wait, C4 is CH2-OAc, which doesn't have a CH3. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is from another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc (trans configuration), making it trans-1-butenyl acetate. In this case, the C1 CH2 would be coupled with the C2 CH, giving a quartet. The C2 CH would be coupled with C1 CH2 and C3 CH2, leading to a dq. The C3 CH2 would be coupled with C2 CH and C4 CH2OAc, perhaps leading to a triplet.

But I'm not matching the 1.6 ppm doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond, like in CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that would be a branch, which may not be one of the options.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on the J=16 Hz, which indicates a trans coupling, the correct answer is likely either option B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

Given that the NMR has a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl attached to a CH2, perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate, where the CH2 adjacent to the double bond is attached to a methyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with option C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but I'm not confident.

Wait, no. Because the J=16 Hz suggests trans, so option C is cis, which would have lower J. So the correct answer must be either B or D.

Since the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to the double bond, which would fit a butenyl group.

So I'll choose option D) Trans-butenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its ¹H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically cis and trans isomers. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester (-OAc), which is a common feature in esters and appears as a singlet due to the absence of neighboring protons.

2. **The doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a proton coupled to another proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). This suggests a trans configuration in a double bond, as trans couplings typically exhibit larger J values compared to cis couplings.

3. **The doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** suggests a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely from adjacent CH₂ groups. This pattern is consistent with a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to two CH₂ groups.

4. **The doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)** corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH₂ group, which is likely adjacent to a double bond. This is a common feature in allylic or vinyl systems.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate**  
  In a cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between protons on the double bond would be smaller (typically around 10–12 Hz) due to the cis dihedral angle. The observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm contradicts this, making this option unlikely.

- **Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate**  
  The structure of trans-propenyl acetate is CH₂=CHCH₂OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2, with the substituents (CH₃ and CH₂OAc) in a trans configuration. The C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to the C1 CH₂ group, and the C1 CH₂ protons would be coupled to the C2 CH proton. However, the NMR data shows a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm, which is more complex than expected for a simple propenyl system. This makes trans-propenyl acetate less likely.

- **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate**  
  In a cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between protons on the double bond would be smaller (around 10–12 Hz). The observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm is inconsistent with a cis configuration, ruling out this option.

- **Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate**  
  The structure of trans-butenyl acetate is CH₃CH=CHCH₂OAc, with the double bond between C2 and C3 in a trans configuration. The C3 proton (CH) would be coupled to the C2 CH and C4 CH₂ groups, leading to a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. The C2 proton (CH) would be coupled to the C1 CH₂ and C3 CH groups, appearing as a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J = 16 Hz. The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to the CH₃ group on C1, which is adjacent to the CH₂ group. This matches the NMR data well, making trans-butenyl acetate the most likely structure.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data, particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the splitting patterns, strongly support a trans configuration. Among the options, **trans-butenyl acetate** best matches the observed data.
