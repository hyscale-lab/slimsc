Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question says Pi(+) is stationary and it decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options are given as pairs of energies, so I guess each option corresponds to the KE of mu+ and the KE of nu, or vice versa. Wait, but neutrinos are almost massless, right? So maybe that simplifies things.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, their energies and momenta are determined by conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must sum to zero. So the momenta of mu+ and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That makes sense because otherwise, there would be some net momentum, which would violate conservation laws.

So, let me list what I know. The rest mass of Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c², and the rest mass of mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is considered zero for these purposes, I think. So the muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because it's massless.

Wait, but the total energy comes from the pion's rest energy. So the sum of the energies of mu and nu should equal the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. But wait, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, right? So E_total = 139.6 MeV.

Let me denote E_mu as the total energy of the muon, which includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, E_nu = K_nu.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. That's equation one.

Now, for momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So p_mu = -p_nu.

Since both the muon and neutrino are moving, their energies and momenta are related by their respective energy-momentum relations. For the muon, which has mass, E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². For the neutrino, which is massless, E_nu² = (p_nu c)².

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, but opposite direction), let's say p_mu = p and p_nu = p as well but in opposite directions. Wait, no, because p_mu and p_nu are vectors. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite. But for the purpose of algebra, perhaps we can set their magnitudes equal and express the vectors as p and -p.

Wait, but actually, for energy and momentum conservation, the sum of the momenta of the two particles must be zero. So p_mu + p_nu = 0. That implies p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite. So when we take the magnitudes, the magnitudes are equal, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, let me write:

E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 → equation (2)
E_nu² = (p c)^2 → equation (3)

Because for neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = p c.

Also, from energy conservation: E_mu + E_nu = M_pi c² → equation (1), where M_pi is the pion mass.

So substituting E_nu from equation (3) into equation (1), we get:

E_mu + (p c) = M_pi c² → equation (1a)

But E_mu is from equation (2): sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So substituting that into equation (1a):

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = M_pi c²

Let me denote x = p c, and m_mu c^2 = 105.7 MeV, M_pi c^2=139.6 MeV.

Then the equation becomes:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

So I'll set up the equation:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the numbers.

Calculate (139.6)^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that.

139.6 * 100 = 13960
139.6 * 39.6 = let's compute 139.6 * 40 = 5584, minus 139.6 → 5584-139.6=5444.4. So total 13960 + 5444.4 = 19404.4. Wait, but wait, perhaps better to compute 139.6^2 accurately.

Alternatively, 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² → 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16 → 19488.16.

Similarly, (105.7)^2: 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So the equation becomes:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * x

So rearranging:

2 * 139.6 * x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11172.49.

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11000 = 8488.16, then subtract 172.49 → 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2 * 139.6 * x = 8315.67

Compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that. Let's see:

279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's a bit more than 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 → let's compute 279.2 * 30 =8376, subtract 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84 → 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Hmm, 8320.16 is just a bit higher than 8315.67. So let's see:

279.2 * 29.78 → Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, 279.2 * 0.78 = approx 279.2 * 0.7=195.44, 279.2 * 0.08=22.336 → total 195.44+22.336=217.776. So 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576.

That's very close to 8315.67. So x is approximately 29.78.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.78 = 8314.576. The desired is 8315.67, so the difference is 8315.67-8314.576=1.094.

So 1.094 /279.2 ≈ 0.00392.

So x ≈ 29.78 + 0.00392 ≈ 29.7839 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

But wait, x is p c, so p = x / c, but since we're working in units where c=1, p is 29.784 MeV/c * c = 29.784 MeV/c²? Wait, no, wait. No, more accurately, in natural units, c=1, so MeV/c is the same as MeV when multiplied by c. I think I might be getting confused here, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the equations as is.

So x is p c = 29.784 MeV. So p = x / c, but since c is in units that make c=1, p is 29.784 MeV/c²? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating; perhaps it's better to carry on with the numbers.

Now, E_nu is p c, which is x = p c =29.784 MeV. So E_nu = 29.784 MeV, which is the neutrino's total energy, which for a neutrino is all kinetic since its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) → sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute that.

Compute 29.784^2: approximately 887. Maybe more accurately:

29.784 * 29.784.

Well, 30^2 is 900. So 29.784 is 30 - 0.216. So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2.

Which is 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 → 900 -12.96 is 887.04, plus 0.046656 is 887.086656.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 887.086656 + 11172.49 = 12059.576656.

Then sqrt(12059.5767) is about sqrt(12059.5767).

Well, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.5767) is a bit less than 110, perhaps 109.8 something.

Wait, let me compute 109.8^2: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8^2 is 0.64, and 2*109*0.8=174.4. So 109.8^2 = 11881 +174.4 +0.64 = 12056.04.

That's close. The actual value is 12059.576656.

So 109.8^2 is 12056.04. The difference is 12059.576656 -12056.04=3.536656.

So I need to find how much more than 109.8 gives an increase of about 3.536656 when squared.

Let me approximate using linear expansion. Let’s say (109.8 + delta)^2 ≈ 109.8^2 + 2*109.8 * delta.

Set that equal to 12059.576656.

So 12056.04 + 2*109.8 * delta = 12059.576656.

So 219.6 * delta = 3.536656 → delta ≈ 3.536656 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So the square root is approximately 109.8 + 0.0161 = 109.8161.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Wait, but earlier in equation (1a), we have E_mu + x = 139.6 MeV. Because x is 29.784, so E_mu ≈ 139.6 -29.784 = 109.816 MeV. Oh, that's consistent. So that makes sense.

So E_mu is about 109.816 MeV.

Now, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c². Because E_mu is the total energy, which is rest mass plus kinetic.

So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.784 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV. So the option D gives these values. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. So that would correspond to K_mu and K_nu.

Wait, but wait a second. In the problem statement, the decay is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu.

Wait, neutrinos are leptons, but their energy is as calculated. So the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV. So the product particles have those KEs.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → sum would be 29.64, but the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. Wait, but the sum of KEs? No, because the total energy is 139.6 MeV, and the rest masses of the products are 105.7 MeV for muon, and 0 for neutrino. So the muon's total energy is 105.7 + K_mu, and the neutrino's energy is K_nu.

So E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu, E_nu = K_nu.

So E_mu + E_nu = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 → K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

In our calculation, K_mu is 4.12 MeV, K_nu is 29.8 MeV → sum 33.92, which matches.

So option D gives these values.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Wait, in the pion rest frame, the total energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's total energy is about 109.816 MeV, which is 105.7 + 4.116 → that's correct. And the neutrino's energy is 29.784 MeV, which is all kinetic. The sum is 109.816 +29.784 = 139.6 MeV. That's correct.

So the kinetic energies are K_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV, K_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 and 29.8. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the π⁺ is 139.6 MeV/c², and the rest mass of the μ⁺ is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy of the system is the rest energy of the π⁺, which is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy of the μ⁺ is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}.
\]

The total energy of the neutrino is purely kinetic since its rest mass is zero:

\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]

From conservation of energy:

\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the π⁺ is initially at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must sum to zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and neutrino are equal, but their directions are opposite:

\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the μ⁺ (which has mass), the energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
\]

For the neutrino (which is massless), the energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
\]

Since \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \), we denote \( p_{\mu} c = p_{\nu} c = x \). Substituting into the equations:

1. For the μ⁺:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]

2. For the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = x.
   \]

From conservation of energy:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \( x \)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2.
\]

Canceling \( x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x.
\]

Substituting numerical values:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]

\[
279.2x = 8315.67.
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus:
\[
E_{\nu} = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the μ⁺:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Calculating:
\[
E_{\mu} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.816 - 105.7 \approx 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Result
The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question says Pi(+) is stationary and it decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options are given as pairs of energies, so I guess each option corresponds to the KE of mu+ and the KE of nu, or vice versa. Wait, but neutrinos are almost massless, right? So maybe that simplifies things.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, their energies and momenta are determined by conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must sum to zero. So the momenta of mu+ and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That makes sense because otherwise, there would be some net momentum, which would violate conservation laws.

So, let me list what I know. The rest mass of Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c², and the rest mass of mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is considered zero for these purposes, I think. So the muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because it's massless.

Wait, but the total energy comes from the pion's rest energy. So the sum of the energies of mu and nu should equal the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. But wait, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, right? So E_total = 139.6 MeV.

Let me denote E_mu as the total energy of the muon, which includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, E_nu = K_nu.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. That's equation one.

Now, for momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So p_mu = -p_nu.

Since both the muon and neutrino are moving, their energies and momenta are related by their respective energy-momentum relations. For the muon, which has mass, E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². For the neutrino, which is massless, E_nu² = (p_nu c)².

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, but opposite direction), let's say p_mu = p and p_nu = p as well but in opposite directions. Wait, no, because p_mu and p_nu are vectors. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite. But for the purpose of algebra, perhaps we can set their magnitudes equal and express the vectors as p and -p.

Wait, but actually, for energy and momentum conservation, the sum of the momenta of the two particles must be zero. So p_mu + p_nu = 0. That implies p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite. So when we take the magnitudes, the magnitudes are equal, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, let me write:

E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 → equation (2)
E_nu² = (p c)^2 → equation (3)

Because for neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = p c.

Also, from energy conservation: E_mu + E_nu = M_pi c² → equation (1), where M_pi is the pion mass.

So substituting E_nu from equation (3) into equation (1), we get:

E_mu + (p c) = M_pi c² → equation (1a)

But E_mu is from equation (2): sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So substituting that into equation (1a):

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = M_pi c²

Let me denote x = p c, and m_mu c^2 = 105.7 MeV, M_pi c^2=139.6 MeV.

Then the equation becomes:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

So I'll set up the equation:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the numbers.

Calculate (139.6)^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that.

139.6 * 100 = 13960
139.6 * 39.6 = let's compute 139.6 * 40 = 5584, minus 139.6 → 5584-139.6=5444.4. So total 13960 + 5444.4 = 19404.4. Wait, but wait, perhaps better to compute 139.6^2 accurately.

Alternatively, 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² → 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16 → 19488.16.

Similarly, (105.7)^2: 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So the equation becomes:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * x

So rearranging:

2 * 139.6 * x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11172.49.

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11000 = 8488.16, then subtract 172.49 → 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2 * 139.6 * x = 8315.67

Compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that. Let's see:

279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's a bit more than 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 → let's compute 279.2 * 30 =8376, subtract 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84 → 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Hmm, 8320.16 is just a bit higher than 8315.67. So let's see:

279.2 * 29.78 → Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, 279.2 * 0.78 = approx 279.2 * 0.7=195.44, 279.2 * 0.08=22.336 → total 195.44+22.336=217.776. So 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576.

That's very close to 8315.67. So x is approximately 29.78.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.78 = 8314.576. The desired is 8315.67, so the difference is 8315.67-8314.576=1.094.

So 1.094 /279.2 ≈ 0.00392.

So x ≈ 29.78 + 0.00392 ≈ 29.7839 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

But wait, x is p c, so p = x / c, but since we're working in units where c=1, p is 29.784 MeV/c * c = 29.784 MeV/c²? Wait, no, wait. No, more accurately, in natural units, c=1, so MeV/c is the same as MeV when multiplied by c. I think I might be getting confused here, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the equations as is.

So x is p c = 29.784 MeV. So p = x / c, but since c is in units that make c=1, p is 29.784 MeV/c²? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating; perhaps it's better to carry on with the numbers.

Now, E_nu is p c, which is x = p c =29.784 MeV. So E_nu = 29.784 MeV, which is the neutrino's total energy, which for a neutrino is all kinetic since its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) → sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute that.

Compute 29.784^2: approximately 887. Maybe more accurately:

29.784 * 29.784.

Well, 30^2 is 900. So 29.784 is 30 - 0.216. So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2.

Which is 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 → 900 -12.96 is 887.04, plus 0.046656 is 887.086656.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 887.086656 + 11172.49 = 12059.576656.

Then sqrt(12059.5767) is about sqrt(12059.5767).

Well, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.5767) is a bit less than 110, perhaps 109.8 something.

Wait, let me compute 109.8^2: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8^2 is 0.64, and 2*109*0.8=174.4. So 109.8^2 = 11881 +174.4 +0.64 = 12056.04.

That's close. The actual value is 12059.576656.

So 109.8^2 is 12056.04. The difference is 12059.576656 -12056.04=3.536656.

So I need to find how much more than 109.8 gives an increase of about 3.536656 when squared.

Let me approximate using linear expansion. Let’s say (109.8 + delta)^2 ≈ 109.8^2 + 2*109.8 * delta.

Set that equal to 12059.576656.

So 12056.04 + 2*109.8 * delta = 12059.576656.

So 219.6 * delta = 3.536656 → delta ≈ 3.536656 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So the square root is approximately 109.8 + 0.0161 = 109.8161.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Wait, but earlier in equation (1a), we have E_mu + x = 139.6 MeV. Because x is 29.784, so E_mu ≈ 139.6 -29.784 = 109.816 MeV. Oh, that's consistent. So that makes sense.

So E_mu is about 109.816 MeV.

Now, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c². Because E_mu is the total energy, which is rest mass plus kinetic.

So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.784 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV. So the option D gives these values. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. So that would correspond to K_mu and K_nu.

Wait, but wait a second. In the problem statement, the decay is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu.

Wait, neutrinos are leptons, but their energy is as calculated. So the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV. So the product particles have those KEs.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → sum would be 29.64, but the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. Wait, but the sum of KEs? No, because the total energy is 139.6 MeV, and the rest masses of the products are 105.7 MeV for muon, and 0 for neutrino. So the muon's total energy is 105.7 + K_mu, and the neutrino's energy is K_nu.

So E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu, E_nu = K_nu.

So E_mu + E_nu = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 → K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

In our calculation, K_mu is 4.12 MeV, K_nu is 29.8 MeV → sum 33.92, which matches.

So option D gives these values.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Wait, in the pion rest frame, the total energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's total energy is about 109.816 MeV, which is 105.7 + 4.116 → that's correct. And the neutrino's energy is 29.784 MeV, which is all kinetic. The sum is 109.816 +29.784 = 139.6 MeV. That's correct.

So the kinetic energies are K_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV, K_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 and 29.8. So the correct answer is D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the π⁺ is 139.6 MeV/c², and the rest mass of the μ⁺ is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy of the system is the rest energy of the π⁺, which is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy of the μ⁺ is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}.
\]

The total energy of the neutrino is purely kinetic since its rest mass is zero:

\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]

From conservation of energy:

\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the π⁺ is initially at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must sum to zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and neutrino are equal, but their directions are opposite:

\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the μ⁺ (which has mass), the energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
\]

For the neutrino (which is massless), the energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
\]

Since \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \), we denote \( p_{\mu} c = p_{\nu} c = x \). Substituting into the equations:

1. For the μ⁺:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]

2. For the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = x.
   \]

From conservation of energy:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \( x \)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2.
\]

Canceling \( x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x.
\]

Substituting numerical values:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]

\[
279.2x = 8315.67.
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus:
\[
E_{\nu} = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the μ⁺:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Calculating:
\[
E_{\mu} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.816 - 105.7 \approx 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Result
The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
