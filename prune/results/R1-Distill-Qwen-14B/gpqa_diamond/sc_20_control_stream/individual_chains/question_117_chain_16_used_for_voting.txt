Hmm, okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four different compounds, and the choices are combinations of them.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has such centers, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers would rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, hence causing optical isomerism.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
Okay, this name is a bit complex. Let me parse it. It's a biphenyl compound, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Specifically, each ring has a nitro group and a carbonyl ester group.

Wait, the structure is dimethyl, so the ester groups are OMe. The arrangement is at 2 and 2' positions on each ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and 6', and a carbonyl-OCH3 at 2 and 2'.

Biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if the two rings are connected in such a way that rotation around the central bond is restricted. But wait, in biphenyls, the rotation around the central bond usually allows for free rotation unless there are bulky groups that prevent it. Here, there are nitro groups and ester groups. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group, and the ester is an electron-withdrawing group too. But do these groups make the rotation around the central bond rigid?

Wait, if the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let's imagine: the two rings each have a nitro at 6 and a carbonyl ester at 2. So if the rings are connected 1,1', then the substituents are in positions that are across. Hmm, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, then the two substituents on each ring might give rise to identical environments, making it impossible to have enantiomers.

Wait, but if the substituents are on the same side of the biphenyl axis, that could lead to different isomers. Wait, no, because biphenyls can have cis and trans arrangements. But in this case, the substituents are on positions that are across, which might lead to different configurations.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion. If so, it wouldn't be chiral. But if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center or a chiral axis. The biphenyl system can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that's not symmetrical. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical, it could have optical isomers. 

In this case, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6 of each ring. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a ester at 2. So the two substituents on each ring are at opposite positions. Wait, that might make the molecule symmetric across the central axis. So maybe it's identical on both sides, making it achiral. Then it wouldn't have optical isomers. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates axial chirality. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each ring has a chiral center. But wait, the carbonyl groups are esters, which are O-C-O. So the carbon attached to the oxygen is connected to four groups: two from the benzene rings, the oxygen from the ester, and the methyl group. Wait, but in esters, the carbonyl is O-C-O, so the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. That carbon (in the ester) is connected to three other groups: the benzene ring, the oxygen (from the ester), and the methyl. No, wait, the structure is O-C-O, so the carbonyl is part of the ester group. So the carbon in the ester is the carbonyl, which is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center because it only has three substituents (the two from the benzene and the OMe group, but wait, the structure is (O-C-O) attached to the benzene. No, I think each ester substituent is a OMe group attached via a carbonyl. So the carbon in the carbonyl is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. So the only way this molecule could have optical isomerism is if the biphenyl system itself is chiral due to axial chirality.

Wait, axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on each phenyl ring are on the same or opposite sides of the central bond. If the substituents on each ring are on the same face, that could lead to a chiral axis. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of a plane of symmetry.

In this compound, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. Let me think about the biphenyl structure. The positions 2 and 6 on each benzene would be across when looking at the rings. Wait, so on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta positions relative to each other. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So the two substituents on each ring are at opposite ends. So when you have the two rings connected, the substituents could be arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, but their positions relative to the central bond could be on the same side or opposite sides.

If the substituents on each ring are on the same side, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides, then the molecule could lack symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, but the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So if one ring's substituents are arranged in a certain way, the other ring's would be opposite. So perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Then it wouldn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. For example, if the two rings each have substituents in positions that are on the same face relative to the central bond. Then the molecule would have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should move on to the next compound and come back.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The formula is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol.

The structure is OMe-O-C-O with the acid part being 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let me structure it. The acid is CH2(COOH)CH2OH? Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid has the structure HOCH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is OMe-O-C-O-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3CH(OH)COO-) when it's the acid. So as an ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, more accurately, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think about the structure:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

      O
      ||
CH2(OH)CH2-C-O-CH3

The carbonyl is in the center, with the ester oxygen. So looking at the hydroxyl group: it's on the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

So the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers here. The central carbon (the one connected to the OH) is the second carbon in the chain.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3

Wait, wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally.

The carbon chain is:

HO-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, no, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

HO-CH2-C(=O)-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Propane has three carbons: CH3CH2CH2-, but propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2C(OH)COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I got it wrong. Let me think about the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOH, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH

So the carbonyl is at the center. The carbon next to the carbonyl (the second carbon) is connected to two CH2 groups, one on each side. Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

The carbonyl group is in the middle. The left side is CH2CH2OH, and the right side is OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the carbons. The ester group is on the first carbon. So:

Carbon 1: O from ester (OCH3)
Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 via carbonyl (C=O)
Carbon 3: connected to Carbon 2, with an OH group
Carbon 4: connected to Carbon 3, another CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the molecule:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the carbonyl is at the end. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, no. The ester group is OCOOCH3. So the structure is:

The carboxylic acid part is CH2CH2COOH, so the ester is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

The central carbon is the one connected to the hydroxyl. Let me imagine the structure:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, and the ester is on the third. So the central carbon is the CH2 connected to the hydroxyl. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the groups attached to that carbon are:

- OH
- CH2 (connected to the next carbon)
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

The central carbon (second carbon) has:

- OH
- CH2- (connected to the first carbon, which is CH3)
- CH2- (connected to the third carbon, which is COOCH3)
- And the fourth group is the other CH2?

Wait, no. The second carbon is CH2, connected to:

- First carbon: CH3
- Third carbon: CH2 (which is connected to the COOCH3)
- And two hydrogens?

Wait, no, because if the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, then the hydroxyl is on the first CH2, the second CH2 is connected to the COOCH3. So the second CH2 is connected to:

- First CH2 (which has the OH)
- Third carbon (COOCH3)
- Two hydrogens.

So the second CH2 is connected to four different groups? Let me see: 

- The first group is the first CH2 (which has the OH)
- The second group is the third carbon (COOCH3)
- The third and fourth groups are two Hs.

Wait, no, because in reality, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to the first CH2 (which is CH2OH), the third CH2 (which is connected to the COOCH3), and two Hs. So the groups are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So the second carbon is connected to two identical Hs. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents.

Wait, that's right. Because the second CH2 has two Hs attached, so it's not a chiral center.

What about other carbons? The third carbon is the COOCH3, which is a carbonyl carbon. It's double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. The first carbon is CH2OH, which is CH2 attached to OH and another CH2. So the groups are:

- OH
- CH2- (connected to the second CH2)
- Two Hs.

So the first carbon has two Hs, so it's not a chiral center.

So, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Did I make a mistake in the structure?

Alternatively, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate part is the acid, so methyl ester. 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3CH(OH)COO-) as the acid, so the ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Ah, wait, that's different. Because 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the acid with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOH, which as an ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So now, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the CH(OH). Let's look at the substituents:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- OH (on the same carbon)
- And what's the fourth group? The central carbon is connected to two CH3 groups? No, wait.

Wait, no. The central carbon is CH, connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH (as a substituent)
- And one more substituent: the hydrogen?

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure:

It's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH) is connected to:

1. A methyl group (CH3) on the left.

2. A carbonyl group (COOCH3) on the right.

3. A hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the same carbon.

4. And a hydrogen atom.

So the four substituents are:

- CH3

- COOCH3

- OH

- H

So yes, all four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Thus, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 can have optical isomers.

So that's compound 2 done. It shows optical isomerism.

3. **benzophenone**  
Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. It has two phenyl groups attached to a ketone.

Structure: Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Looking for chiral centers. The central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl. It can't be a chiral center because it's double-bonded, so it's connected to only three groups (two phenyl and one O). So no chiral centers.

Also, the molecule is symmetrical because both phenyl groups are identical. So any substitution would be symmetrical, so no possibility of enantiomers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**  
Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the diester, so dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester.

Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)- but that's not right. Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, wait. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, so each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, looking for stereoisomerism. Since the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each side, it can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans). But the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chirality.

Wait, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let me see. Each ester group is OMe attached to the carbonyl. The central double bond is between the two carbonyls.

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-OCH3  
   \  
C=C  
   /  
O=C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration.

Wait, but each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two OCOOCH3 groups and two H's? No, in fumarate, the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Structure: HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, wait no, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the substituents in the trans configuration.

So the structure is:

      O
      ||
CH3O-C - C - COOCH3
      ||
      O

Wait, no. Wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of those carbons is connected to two ester groups. So each of those carbons is connected to two OCOOCH3 groups, two methyl groups (from the ester), and perhaps some hydrogens.

Wait, no. Each of the central carbons is connected to one OCOOCH3 group and one CH3O group? No, wait, fumarate is OOC-CH2-CH2-COO- but with a double bond. No, wait again.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So each of the central carbons is connected to one COOH group and one H.

So when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, looking for chiral centers. Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups, a hydrogen, and another carbon (the double bond). But wait, in the double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents: the ester group and the other carbon.

Wait, but the double bond is between the two carbons that each have an ester group and a hydrogen. So each of those carbons is bonded to:

- One ester group (OOCCH3)
- One hydrogen
- Two other carbons (the other end of the double bond and the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
||          ||
O          O

No, wait, no. The correct structure is:

O=C-OCH3  
   \  
    C=C  
   /  
O=C-OCH3

But this is in the trans configuration. Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- OCOOCH3 group on one side
- H on the other side
- And the two adjacent carbons (the other double bond carbon and the next in the chain? No, wait, no. Wait, each of the central carbons is part of the double bond.

Wait, each of the central carbons is connected to:

- One OCOOCH3 group (from the ester)
- One H (if the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, each CH is connected to one OCOOCH3 and one H, and the other two bonds are to the adjacent CH.)

So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- OCOOCH3
- H
- Double bond to the other central carbon.

So each central carbon is connected to two substituents: OCOOCH3 and H, with the other two bonds being the double bond. So each of those carbons has a double bond, so they're sp² hybridized. Therefore, each carbon in the double bond is trigonal planar and not a chiral center.

But wait, how about the other carbons? Are there any other chiral centers in the molecule?

The ester groups are OCOOCH3. Each ester group's carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbons attached are not chiral centers.

So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? I don't think so because all the carbons are either sp³ (with four substituents) but not in a chiral arrangement, or sp².

Wait, wait another thought. Fumarate is a trans diastereomer of maleate. But maleate is the cis isomer. However, the question is about optical isomerism, not geometric isomerism.

So, does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, and the structure is symmetric. So the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe not. Wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, in the trans configuration, each of the substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's achiral. So it cannot show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. But if they were on the same side (cis), would that lead to a chiral center?

Wait, no. Because if the substituents are on the same side, the molecule would still have a plane of symmetry. For example, in the cis case, each substituent is on the same side, so the molecule is still symmetrical. So both cis and trans dimethyl fumarate are achiral, meaning they don't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because I remember that some diesters can have optical isomerism if they are not symmetrical. For example, if the groups on either side of the double bond are different, then the molecule can have a chiral axis.

Wait, no. Wait, another possibility: if the substituents are different on each side of the double bond, then the molecule could be chiral. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same: each is a OCOOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because fumarate is a trans isomer and maleate is cis. But both are diastereomers, but not enantiomers because they're not chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think of another approach. If a molecule has a double bond with substituents that make it asymmetrical, does that lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: Each of the substituents on the double bond is an ester group. The molecule has a plane of symmetry because the two substituents are identical. So it can't be chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: Not sure yet. Let's revisit.

Compound 2: Yes, has a chiral center, so yes.

Compound 3: No, no chiral centers.

Compound 4: No, no chiral centers.

Wait, but I'm not confident about compound 1. Let me think again.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro group and a carboxylate ester (OCH3) group.

So each ring has:

- At position 2: OMeCOO-
- At position 6: NO2

The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring.

Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or axial chirality.

Each ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carbonyl ester at 2. So each substituent is in a meta position relative to each other on the ring.

But the arrangement around the central bond could lead to axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on each phenyl ring are on opposite faces relative to the central bond.

If the substituents on each ring are on the same face, the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if they are on opposite faces, it might be achiral.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the central bond is between position 1 of each ring, then the substituents at 2 and 6 are in positions that are in different orientations relative to the central bond.

I think this molecule could have axial chirality. Because the substituents are in positions that are not symmetric across the central bond, so their arrangement (cis or trans) around the central bond would determine if the molecule is chiral.

So, for example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face, the molecule would have a non-symmetrical arrangement, leading to axial chirality and thus optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if they are on opposite faces, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

But whether the substituents can be arranged in a way that leads to axial chirality depends on their positions.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, on each ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 are meta to each other. So, their positions relative to the central bond might allow for different configurations, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, another approach: if the two substituents on each ring are in positions that do not mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule could lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. If on each ring, the substituents are on the same side of the ring relative to the central bond, the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if they're on opposite sides, it might be achiral.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of the structure.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the central bond is between the 1 positions, then the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other on the ring.

So, the substituents on each ring are across from each other, which might make the molecule symmetrical across the central bond, leading to achirality.

Wait, but the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions. So, if the two substituents on each ring are both on the same side of the central bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, since each substituent is on a different ring, their positions could create a chiral axis.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, some sources suggest that biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can exhibit axial chirality. For example, in the case of 1,1'-binaphthyl derivatives, substituents in specific positions can lead to axial chirality.

In this case, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring of a biphenyl. Since these positions are meta to each other on each ring, their arrangement around the central bond could lead to axial chirality.

Thus, compound 1 may exhibit axial chirality and hence optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: Yes (axial chirality)

Compound 2: Yes (chiral center)

Compound 3: No

Compound 4: No

Now, looking at the options:

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → our analysis says 1 and 2, so this is incorrect.

B) 3 and 4 → no, both are incorrect.

C) 2 and 3 → no, 3 is incorrect.

D) 1 and 2 → yes, both show optical isomerism.

So the correct answer would be option A) if 4 is also correct, but in our analysis, 4 is not. So the correct option is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 doesn't show optical isomerism, so the correct answer would be options 1 and 2, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (a carbon bonded to four different groups) or exhibits axial chirality (asymmetric arrangement around a central bond).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents include nitro groups and ester groups. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. Since the substituents at positions 2 and 6 are not symmetrical across the central bond, the molecule can lack a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality and optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group (second carbon) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups, making it achiral and unable to exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical, as the substituents on both sides of the double bond are identical (two ester groups). This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits axial chirality and optical isomerism.
- Compound 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.
- Compound 3 is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.
- Compound 4 is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

The compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.

**Answer: D**
