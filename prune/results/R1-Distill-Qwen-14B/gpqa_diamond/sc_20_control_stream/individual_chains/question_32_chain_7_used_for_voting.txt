Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I remember RHIC is used for colliding heavy ions, right? The question is about finding the energy when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. 

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Okay, so the nucleus is Li-6.

So the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. I think I need to use relativistic equations here. Right, because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m_0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that. So v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let's calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

Wait, so 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then the denominator in gamma is sqrt(0.0784). What's the square root of 0.0784? Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 which is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me make sure: 25 divided by 7 is around 3.5714, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1 / 0.28. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98. So 3.5 times 0.28 is 0.98. So 1 - 0.98 is 0.02, so 3.57 times 0.28: 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 0.57 is about 0.16. 0.84 + 0.16 = 1. So yeah, 3.5714 is correct.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. Since it's Li-6, the molar mass is about 6 g/mol. Let's find the rest mass energy, m_0 c². 

Wait, but in particle physics, energies are often given in GeV, and the mass is in terms of u (atomic mass units). So I need to convert the mass of Li-6 into energy in GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So first, find the mass of Li-6 in u.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512 u. Wait, I think the exact value is around 6.01512 atomic mass units. I might need to look up or calculate more accurately, but for now, I'll proceed with that.

So, m = 6.01512 u. Then, m c² is 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.01512 * 931.5 is approximately 14.06 MeV. So adding them gives 5589 + 14.06 = approximately 5603.06 MeV. Which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, let me compute it precisely: 6.01512 * 931.5.

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589. Then 0.01512 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315; 0.005*931.5=4.6575; 0.00012 *931.5≈0.1118. So adding 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.1118=≈14.0843.

So total is 5589 + 14.0843 = 5603.0843 MeV → 5.6030843 GeV.

So m_0 c² is approximately 5.6031 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m_0 c². So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3 *5.6031 is 16.8093, 0.5714 *5.6031 is approximately:

0.5 *5.6031=2.80155; 0.0714 *5.6031 ≈ 0.401. So total 2.80155 +0.401≈3.20255.

So 16.8093 +3.20255=20.01185 GeV.

Wait, but I can compute it more accurately. Let's do 3.5714 *5.6031.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857

3.5714 *0.6031: let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284; 3.5714 *0.0031≈0.01107. So total 2.14284 +0.01107≈2.15391.

So total E is 17.857 +2.15391=20.01091 GeV. Approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069, option D is 21.419, and A is 18.475.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3.5714 multiplied by 5.6031.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.5714 *5.6031:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 *0.0031 = approx 0.01107.

Wait, but maybe that's not the right breakdown. Alternatively, 5.6031 is 5 + 0.6 +0.0031.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me write it as (3.5714) * (5.6031) = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6031:

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.8570
3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 *0.0031=0.01107134
So adding: 17.8570 +2.14284=20.0, then 20.0 +0.01107134=20.01107 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because 5.6031 is 5 + 0.6031, not 5+0.6+0.0031. Oh wait, no: 5.6031 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.0031. So yeah, the approach is correct.

Wait, but 3.5714 *5.6031 is exactly 3.5714 *5 +3.5714 *0.6 +3.5714 *0.0031. So that's correct.

Wait, but 3.5714 multiplied by 5.6031 would be 3.5714*(5 +0.6 +0.0031) = 3.5714*5 + 3.5714*0.6 +3.5714*0.0031.

So 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0031 = 0.01107134.

Adding them: 17.857 +2.14284 =20.0, then 20.0 +0.01107134=20.01107 GeV.

So the energy is approximately 20.011 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is higher than our calculation. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

v=0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857..., so approximately 3.5714. That seems correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, right? Because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428... So that's correct.

So the gamma is correct. Then, the mass calculation: the mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u. Each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.01512 *931.5 MeV is 6.01512 *931.5 = let's compute this accurately.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01512 *931.5: Let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005*931.5=4.6575, 0.00012*931.5=0.11178.

Adding 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.11178=14.08428.

So total is 5589 +14.08428=5603.08428 MeV, which is 5.60308428 GeV.

So m_0 c² is 5.60308428 GeV.

So E = gamma * m_0 c² =3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Let's compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Let me calculate 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00308428.

Wait, 5.60308428 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.00308428.

So 3.57142857 *0.00308428 ≈ let's compute it.

0.00308428 *3 = 0.00925284.

0.00308428 *0.57142857 ≈ 0.00308428 * 0.5 =0.00154214, and 0.00308428 *0.07142857≈0.00022068. So total ≈0.00154214 +0.00022068=0.00176282.

So adding all parts: 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 =20.0, then 20.0 +0.00925284=20.00925284, plus 0.00176282 gives 20.01091566 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass of Li-6. Wait, perhaps the actual mass is 6.01512 u? Or maybe it's a different isotope.

Wait, Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.01512 u. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using the atomic mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512234 u. So that's precise. So 6.01512234 u.

So m_0 c² is 6.01512234 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.01512234 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.5 = let's compute more accurately.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00012234*931.5= approximately 0.1137.

So 0.01512234 *931.5 =9.315 +4.6575 +0.1137 =14.0862 MeV.

So total is 5589 MeV +14.0862 MeV =5603.0862 MeV, which is 5.6030862 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857, so E=3.57142857 *5.6030862 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0030862 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0030862 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.01107.

So adding 17.85714285 +2.14285714 =20.0.

Then 20.0 +0.01107 ≈20.01107 GeV.

So around 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the gamma or the mass.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of its constituent protons and neutrons, considering their individual rest masses. But that's more complicated, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the average of the binding energy, but in reality, the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass. So I think using the exact mass of the nucleus is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But since the binding energy is much smaller than the rest mass (like a few MeV for Li-6), maybe it's negligible. But to be precise, perhaps I should compute it.

Let me think: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So for 3 protons: 3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u.

3 neutrons:3 *1.008665=3.025995 u.

Total:3.021828 +3.025995=6.047823 u.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. So the difference is 6.047823 -6.015122=0.032701 u. This is the binding energy, which when converted to energy is about 0.032701 u *931.5 MeV/u =30.48 MeV.

So the binding energy is about 30.48 MeV, which is much smaller than the rest mass of 5.6 GeV. So the initial approach of taking the nuclear mass as 6.01512 u is correct because the binding energy is negligible for this calculation.

So back to the calculation: the energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking again at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

So none of the options match exactly, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher than our 20.011. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)).

Let me compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me compute 6.01512234 *931.5.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.5= let's compute using exact multiplication.

0.01512234 *931.5:

= (0.01 + 0.005 + 0.00012234) *931.5

= 0.01*931.5=9.315,

0.005*931.5=4.6575,

0.00012234 *931.5≈0.1137.

Adding: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.1137=14.0862 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.0862=5603.0862 MeV → 5.6030862 GeV.

Now, 3.57142857 *5.6030862:

Let me compute using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 *5.6030862:

= (3 + 0.57142857) * (5 + 0.6030862)

But perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

3.57142857 *5.6030862:

= (3.57142857) *5.6030862

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862 = ?

Hmm, perhaps a more precise way:

Calculate 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Break it into parts:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.0030862 = ?

Compute 0.0030862 *3.57142857:

0.003 *3.57142857=0.01071428571

0.0000862 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.0003075.

Adding them: 0.01071428571 +0.0003075 ≈0.0110218.

So adding all parts:17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0, then +0.0110218=20.0110218 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but it's about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the gamma factor more accurately. Let me compute beta as 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a calculator for more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me recheck.

The mass of Li-6 is 6.01512234 u.

So 6.01512234 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 931.5 MeV/u is 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6.01512234 u *0.9315 GeV/u = ?

6 u *0.9315=5.589 GeV.

0.01512234 u *0.9315 GeV/u.

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315 GeV.

0.005 *0.9315=0.0046575 GeV.

0.00012234 *0.9315=0.0001137 GeV.

Adding: 0.009315 +0.0046575 = 0.0139725 +0.0001137=0.0140862 GeV.

So total m_0 c² is 5.589 +0.0140862=5.6030862 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that in RHIC, the energy is given per nucleon, but no, the question says the energy of the nucleus.

Wait, no, the question states the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So the nucleus is moving at that speed, so the total energy is gamma times m_0 c².

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the mass is 6.01512 u. Maybe the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, so perhaps the mass is taken as A * (mass of a nucleon).

Wait, the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1.007276 u. So for Li-6, A=6, so 6 *1.007276 u =6.043656 u. But this doesn't match the actual mass of Li-6, which is about 6.01512 u. So the initial approach of using the exact mass is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma to more decimal places.

Wait, gamma is 3.57142857, but perhaps in reality, when computing with higher precision, it affects the result.

Wait, but in our calculation, gamma is exactly 3.57142857, so when multiplied by exactly 5.6030862 GeV, it's 20.011 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy (K.E.) instead of the total energy. Because sometimes in such questions, people confuse between K.E. and total energy.

The question says, "What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed...". The RHIC provides the kinetic energy, perhaps. Or maybe the total energy.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: the energy of the RHIC is the energy imparted to the nucleus. So it's the total energy, E = gamma m c².

But perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy, which is E - m c².

So let's compute the kinetic energy: KE = (gamma - 1) m c².

In our case, gamma is 3.5714, so KE= (2.5714) *5.6030862 GeV.

2.5714 *5.6030862.

Compute 2*5.6030862=11.2061724.

0.5714 *5.6030862.

0.5 *5.6030862=2.8015431.

0.0714 *5.6030862 ≈0.4015.

So 2.8015431 +0.4015≈3.2030.

So total KE is 11.2061724 +3.2030≈14.40917 GeV.

But the options don't have 14 GeV, so perhaps that's not the case. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy.

Hmm. So I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 20.011 GeV. But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the mass is taken as 6 nucleons, each of 1 GeV/c². But that's unlikely, as 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 *0.9315 GeV/c². Let's see: 6 *0.9315=5.589 GeV, which is close to our earlier calculation.

So gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 *5.589=?

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589≈3.198.

So about 16.767 +3.198=20.065 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.065 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132). Hmm.

But wait, using the exact mass, we have E=20.011 GeV, which is about 20.01.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, beta is 0.96. Let me compute gamma accurately using the exact formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

So correct.

Hmm, maybe I should use a more precise calculation for the product 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Let me compute this using a more precise method.

3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Let me compute this as (3 + 0.57142857) * (5 + 0.6030862).

= 3*5 +3*0.6030862 +0.57142857*5 +0.57142857 *0.6030862.

Compute each term:

3*5 =15.

3*0.6030862 =1.8092586.

0.57142857 *5 =2.85714285.

0.57142857 *0.6030862 = compute this.

Let me approximate 0.57142857 *0.6030862.

0.5 *0.6030862 =0.3015431.

0.07142857 *0.6030862 ≈0.04311.

So total is approximately 0.3015431 +0.04311 =0.3446531.

Now, sum all terms:

15 +1.8092586=16.8092586,

16.8092586 +2.85714285=19.66640145,

19.66640145 +0.3446531=20.01105455 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV.

So the correct energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, but it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a more precise calculation, leading to a value around 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862 with more precise decimal places.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

3.57142857 ×5.6030862.

Let me write this as:

3.57142857  
×5.6030862  
____________  
We'll compute digit by digit.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: 

3.57142857 ×5.6030862 = ?

Well, perhaps using a calculator:

3.57142857 ×5.6030862.

I can use the fact that 3.57142857 ×5.6030862 = ?

Well, 3.57142857 = 25/7.

And 5.6030862 is approximately 5.603086.

So 25/7 ×5.603086 = (25 ×5.603086)/7.

Compute 25 ×5.603086=140.07715.

Divide by 7:140.07715 /7 ≈20.0110214 GeV.

So yes, approximately 20.011 GeV.

So the correct answer isn't among the options. Wait, but the options include option C: 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the mass of Li-6 again.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512234 u.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy more accurately.

Wait, 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

More precisely, let's compute 3.57142857 ×5.6030862.

Breaking it down:

Let me compute each digit's contribution.

3.57142857 ×5.6030862:

= 3 ×5 =15.

3 ×0.6 =1.8.

3 ×0.0030862 =0.0092586.

0.5 ×5=2.5.

0.5 ×0.6=0.3.

0.5 ×0.0030862=0.0015431.

0.07142857 ×5=0.35714285.

0.07142857 ×0.6=0.042857142.

0.07142857 ×0.0030862 ≈0.0002204.

Adding these:

15 +1.8 +0.0092586 =16.8092586.

Adding 2.5 +0.3 +0.0015431 =2.8015431.

Adding 0.35714285 +0.042857142 =0.4.

Adding 0.0002204.

So total:

16.8092586 +2.8015431 =19.6108017.

19.6108017 +0.4 =20.0108017.

20.0108017 +0.0002204 =20.0110221 GeV.

Hmm, so it's 20.0110221 GeV.

So, none of the options match precisely. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher by about 0.12 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another possibility is that the problem is considering the speed of the nucleons within the nucleus, but no, the question states the speed of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking per nucleon energy, but no, the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic momentum, but the question is about energy, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c. But in particle physics, c is taken as 1 in units where c=1, but when converting to GeV, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps my calculation is missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects to calculate using beta=0.96, and using gamma = (1-beta^2)^(-1/2).

But perhaps I should compute it with more precise decimal places.

Wait, beta is exactly 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216, and 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, perhaps it's 931.52 MeV/u, a more precise value.

So 6.01512234 u *931.52 MeV/u = ?

6.01512234 *931.52 = let me compute.

6 *931.52 =5589.12 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.52 = ?

0.01 *931.52=9.3152.

0.005 *931.52=4.6576.

0.00012234 *931.52≈0.1137.

So adding: 9.3152 +4.6576=13.9728 +0.1137=14.0865 MeV.

So total is 5589.12 +14.0865=5603.2065 MeV → 5.6032065 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6032065.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6032065.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6032065.

Again, breaking it down:

3*5.6032065=16.8096195.

0.57142857 *5.6032065.

Compute 0.5 *5.6032065=2.80160325.

0.07142857 *5.6032065 ≈0.401718.

So total 2.80160325 +0.401718=3.20332125.

Add to 16.8096195:16.8096195 +3.20332125=20.01294075 GeV.

Hmm, now it's 20.0129 GeV.

Still, the option closest is C:20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in the format of four decimal places, but in the options, some are given to three decimal places. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6032065 with higher precision.

3.57142857 ×5.6032065:

= (3 + 0.57142857) × (5 + 0.6032065)

= 3×5 +3×0.6032065 +0.57142857×5 +0.57142857 ×0.6032065.

Compute each term:

3×5=15.

3×0.6032065=1.8096195.

0.57142857×5=2.85714285.

0.57142857×0.6032065.

Compute this part precisely:

0.57142857 ×0.6032065.

=0.5×0.6032065 +0.07142857×0.6032065.

0.5×0.6032065=0.30160325.

0.07142857×0.6032065.

Compute 0.07 ×0.6032065=0.042224455.

0.00142857 ×0.6032065≈0.0008625.

So total around 0.042224455 +0.0008625 ≈0.043086955.

So 0.30160325 +0.043086955≈0.344690205.

Now, summing all terms:

15 +1.8096195=16.8096195.

16.8096195 +2.85714285=19.66676235.

19.66676235 +0.344690205=20.01145255 GeV.

So approximately 20.01145 GeV.

Hmm. So the precise calculation gives about 20.011 GeV, but none of the options match. The closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the mass is 6.01512234 u. Maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, looking up the exact mass of Li-6: it's 6.01512234 u. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for c. For example, sometimes c is taken as 3e8 m/s, but in units where c=1, it's already accounted for.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation seems to give approximately 20.011 GeV, but the options don't have that. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is calculated as gamma * m c², where m is the mass of the nucleus in kg, and then converted to GeV. But that's the same as using m c² in GeV.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for 931.5 MeV/u. Let me use 931.52 MeV/u.

So m c²=6.01512234 *931.52 MeV = ?

Let me compute 6.01512234 ×931.52.

= (6 + 0.01512234) ×931.52.

=6×931.52=5589.12 MeV.

0.01512234 ×931.52= let's compute.

0.01 ×931.52=9.3152.

0.005 ×931.52=4.6576.

0.00012234 ×931.52≈0.1137.

Adding:9.3152 +4.6576=13.9728 +0.1137=14.0865 MeV.

So total m c²=5589.12 +14.0865=5603.2065 MeV=5.6032065 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 ×5.6032065.

Again, 3.57142857 ×5.6032065.

As before, it comes to about 20.011 GeV.

So I'm confident that the correct energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the problem is using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

The kinetic energy (KE) is E - m c² = gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma-1) m c².

So KE = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6032065 GeV.

=2.57142857 *5.6032065.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.6032065.

=2 ×5.6032065=11.206413.

0.57142857 ×5.6032065 ≈3.203321.

So KE≈11.206413 +3.203321=14.409734 GeV.

So if the problem is asking for KE, the answer is about 14.41 GeV. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. However, I'm not sure why the calculation isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is not moving at 0.96c, but each nucleon is moving at 0.96c. But that's not the case; the nucleus as a whole moves at that speed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass used is the mass per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. But that would give a larger mass, leading to a higher energy.

For example, Li-6 has 6 nucleons. Mass per nucleon is approximately 1.007276 u. So 6 ×1.007276=6.043656 u. Then m c²=6.043656 ×931.5 MeV=6.043656 ×0.9315 GeV=5.636 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 ×5.636=20.138 GeV.

Ah! So that would give approximately 20.138 GeV, which matches option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the rest mass I used earlier was the exact mass of Li-6, which is 6.01512 u. But perhaps the problem is assuming each nucleon has a mass of about 1 GeV/c², so 6 ×1 GeV=6 GeV, leading to E=3.5714 ×6=21.428 GeV, which would be option D:21.419 GeV. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons without considering binding energy. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: ~1.007276 u each, neutron: ~1.008665 u each.

3×1.007276=3.021828 u.

3×1.008665=3.025995 u.

Total:6.047823 u.

So m c²=6.047823 u ×931.5 MeV/u=6.047823 ×0.9315 GeV=5.6435 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714, so E=3.5714 ×5.6435=?

3.5714 ×5=17.857.

3.5714 ×0.6435=?

0.6 ×3.5714=2.14284.

0.0435 ×3.5714≈0.1553.

So total 2.14284 +0.1553≈2.29814.

So E=17.857 +2.29814≈20.155 GeV.

Which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using this approach, leading to approximately 20.155 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV as option C.

But wait, the exact calculation using the actual nuclear mass gives 20.011 GeV, but using the sum of individual nucleon masses gives around 20.155 GeV. So perhaps the problem expects the latter approach.

But why would the problem do that? Because in reality, the nuclear mass is less than the sum of the individual nucleon masses due to binding energy. So the correct approach is to use the nuclear mass.

But perhaps the problem is not considering binding energy and just uses the sum of nucleon masses. In that case, the answer would be option C:20.132 GeV.

So, given that, the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6.01512 u. The rest energy of the nucleus is calculated as:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.01512 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor, \(\gamma\), is determined from the velocity \(v = 0.96c\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
\]

The total energy of the relativistic nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6031 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This calculation assumes the exact nuclear mass of Li-6 (6.01512 u) and does not account for binding energy corrections. However, none of the provided options exactly match this result. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which may arise if the problem assumes the sum of individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without considering binding energy. Using this approach:

- Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
- The mass of a proton is approximately \(1.007276 \, \text{u}\), and the mass of a neutron is approximately \(1.008665 \, \text{u}\).
- Total mass of the nucleus: \(3 \times 1.007276 + 3 \times 1.008665 = 6.047823 \, \text{u}\).
- Rest energy: \(6.047823 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.6435 \, \text{GeV}\).
- Total energy: \(\gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6435 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.155 \, \text{GeV}\).

This result is close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. Given the discrepancy between the exact nuclear mass and the sum of nucleon masses, the problem likely assumes the latter approach. Thus, the best answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I remember RHIC is used for colliding heavy ions, right? The question is about finding the energy when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. 

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Okay, so the nucleus is Li-6.

So the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. I think I need to use relativistic equations here. Right, because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m_0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that. So v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let's calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

Wait, so 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then the denominator in gamma is sqrt(0.0784). What's the square root of 0.0784? Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 which is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me make sure: 25 divided by 7 is around 3.5714, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1 / 0.28. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98. So 3.5 times 0.28 is 0.98. So 1 - 0.98 is 0.02, so 3.57 times 0.28: 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 0.57 is about 0.16. 0.84 + 0.16 = 1. So yeah, 3.5714 is correct.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. Since it's Li-6, the molar mass is about 6 g/mol. Let's find the rest mass energy, m_0 c². 

Wait, but in particle physics, energies are often given in GeV, and the mass is in terms of u (atomic mass units). So I need to convert the mass of Li-6 into energy in GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So first, find the mass of Li-6 in u.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512 u. Wait, I think the exact value is around 6.01512 atomic mass units. I might need to look up or calculate more accurately, but for now, I'll proceed with that.

So, m = 6.01512 u. Then, m c² is 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.01512 * 931.5 is approximately 14.06 MeV. So adding them gives 5589 + 14.06 = approximately 5603.06 MeV. Which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, let me compute it precisely: 6.01512 * 931.5.

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589. Then 0.01512 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315; 0.005*931.5=4.6575; 0.00012 *931.5≈0.1118. So adding 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.1118=≈14.0843.

So total is 5589 + 14.0843 = 5603.0843 MeV → 5.6030843 GeV.

So m_0 c² is approximately 5.6031 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m_0 c². So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3 *5.6031 is 16.8093, 0.5714 *5.6031 is approximately:

0.5 *5.6031=2.80155; 0.0714 *5.6031 ≈ 0.401. So total 2.80155 +0.401≈3.20255.

So 16.8093 +3.20255=20.01185 GeV.

Wait, but I can compute it more accurately. Let's do 3.5714 *5.6031.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857

3.5714 *0.6031: let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284; 3.5714 *0.0031≈0.01107. So total 2.14284 +0.01107≈2.15391.

So total E is 17.857 +2.15391=20.01091 GeV. Approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069, option D is 21.419, and A is 18.475.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3.5714 multiplied by 5.6031.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.5714 *5.6031:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 *0.0031 = approx 0.01107.

Wait, but maybe that's not the right breakdown. Alternatively, 5.6031 is 5 + 0.6 +0.0031.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me write it as (3.5714) * (5.6031) = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6031:

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.8570
3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 *0.0031=0.01107134
So adding: 17.8570 +2.14284=20.0, then 20.0 +0.01107134=20.01107 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because 5.6031 is 5 + 0.6031, not 5+0.6+0.0031. Oh wait, no: 5.6031 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.0031. So yeah, the approach is correct.

Wait, but 3.5714 *5.6031 is exactly 3.5714 *5 +3.5714 *0.6 +3.5714 *0.0031. So that's correct.

Wait, but 3.5714 multiplied by 5.6031 would be 3.5714*(5 +0.6 +0.0031) = 3.5714*5 + 3.5714*0.6 +3.5714*0.0031.

So 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0031 = 0.01107134.

Adding them: 17.857 +2.14284 =20.0, then 20.0 +0.01107134=20.01107 GeV.

So the energy is approximately 20.011 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is higher than our calculation. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

v=0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857..., so approximately 3.5714. That seems correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, right? Because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428... So that's correct.

So the gamma is correct. Then, the mass calculation: the mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u. Each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.01512 *931.5 MeV is 6.01512 *931.5 = let's compute this accurately.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01512 *931.5: Let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005*931.5=4.6575, 0.00012*931.5=0.11178.

Adding 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.11178=14.08428.

So total is 5589 +14.08428=5603.08428 MeV, which is 5.60308428 GeV.

So m_0 c² is 5.60308428 GeV.

So E = gamma * m_0 c² =3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Let's compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Let me calculate 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00308428.

Wait, 5.60308428 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.00308428.

So 3.57142857 *0.00308428 ≈ let's compute it.

0.00308428 *3 = 0.00925284.

0.00308428 *0.57142857 ≈ 0.00308428 * 0.5 =0.00154214, and 0.00308428 *0.07142857≈0.00022068. So total ≈0.00154214 +0.00022068=0.00176282.

So adding all parts: 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 =20.0, then 20.0 +0.00925284=20.00925284, plus 0.00176282 gives 20.01091566 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass of Li-6. Wait, perhaps the actual mass is 6.01512 u? Or maybe it's a different isotope.

Wait, Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.01512 u. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using the atomic mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512234 u. So that's precise. So 6.01512234 u.

So m_0 c² is 6.01512234 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.01512234 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.5 = let's compute more accurately.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00012234*931.5= approximately 0.1137.

So 0.01512234 *931.5 =9.315 +4.6575 +0.1137 =14.0862 MeV.

So total is 5589 MeV +14.0862 MeV =5603.0862 MeV, which is 5.6030862 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857, so E=3.57142857 *5.6030862 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0030862 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0030862 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.01107.

So adding 17.85714285 +2.14285714 =20.0.

Then 20.0 +0.01107 ≈20.01107 GeV.

So around 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the gamma or the mass.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of its constituent protons and neutrons, considering their individual rest masses. But that's more complicated, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the average of the binding energy, but in reality, the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass. So I think using the exact mass of the nucleus is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But since the binding energy is much smaller than the rest mass (like a few MeV for Li-6), maybe it's negligible. But to be precise, perhaps I should compute it.

Let me think: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So for 3 protons: 3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u.

3 neutrons:3 *1.008665=3.025995 u.

Total:3.021828 +3.025995=6.047823 u.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. So the difference is 6.047823 -6.015122=0.032701 u. This is the binding energy, which when converted to energy is about 0.032701 u *931.5 MeV/u =30.48 MeV.

So the binding energy is about 30.48 MeV, which is much smaller than the rest mass of 5.6 GeV. So the initial approach of taking the nuclear mass as 6.01512 u is correct because the binding energy is negligible for this calculation.

So back to the calculation: the energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking again at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

So none of the options match exactly, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher than our 20.011. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)).

Let me compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me compute 6.01512234 *931.5.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.5= let's compute using exact multiplication.

0.01512234 *931.5:

= (0.01 + 0.005 + 0.00012234) *931.5

= 0.01*931.5=9.315,

0.005*931.5=4.6575,

0.00012234 *931.5≈0.1137.

Adding: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.1137=14.0862 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.0862=5603.0862 MeV → 5.6030862 GeV.

Now, 3.57142857 *5.6030862:

Let me compute using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 *5.6030862:

= (3 + 0.57142857) * (5 + 0.6030862)

But perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

3.57142857 *5.6030862:

= (3.57142857) *5.6030862

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862 = ?

Hmm, perhaps a more precise way:

Calculate 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Break it into parts:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.0030862 = ?

Compute 0.0030862 *3.57142857:

0.003 *3.57142857=0.01071428571

0.0000862 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.0003075.

Adding them: 0.01071428571 +0.0003075 ≈0.0110218.

So adding all parts:17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0, then +0.0110218=20.0110218 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but it's about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the gamma factor more accurately. Let me compute beta as 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a calculator for more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me recheck.

The mass of Li-6 is 6.01512234 u.

So 6.01512234 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 931.5 MeV/u is 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6.01512234 u *0.9315 GeV/u = ?

6 u *0.9315=5.589 GeV.

0.01512234 u *0.9315 GeV/u.

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315 GeV.

0.005 *0.9315=0.0046575 GeV.

0.00012234 *0.9315=0.0001137 GeV.

Adding: 0.009315 +0.0046575 = 0.0139725 +0.0001137=0.0140862 GeV.

So total m_0 c² is 5.589 +0.0140862=5.6030862 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that in RHIC, the energy is given per nucleon, but no, the question says the energy of the nucleus.

Wait, no, the question states the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So the nucleus is moving at that speed, so the total energy is gamma times m_0 c².

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the mass is 6.01512 u. Maybe the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, so perhaps the mass is taken as A * (mass of a nucleon).

Wait, the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1.007276 u. So for Li-6, A=6, so 6 *1.007276 u =6.043656 u. But this doesn't match the actual mass of Li-6, which is about 6.01512 u. So the initial approach of using the exact mass is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma to more decimal places.

Wait, gamma is 3.57142857, but perhaps in reality, when computing with higher precision, it affects the result.

Wait, but in our calculation, gamma is exactly 3.57142857, so when multiplied by exactly 5.6030862 GeV, it's 20.011 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy (K.E.) instead of the total energy. Because sometimes in such questions, people confuse between K.E. and total energy.

The question says, "What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed...". The RHIC provides the kinetic energy, perhaps. Or maybe the total energy.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: the energy of the RHIC is the energy imparted to the nucleus. So it's the total energy, E = gamma m c².

But perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy, which is E - m c².

So let's compute the kinetic energy: KE = (gamma - 1) m c².

In our case, gamma is 3.5714, so KE= (2.5714) *5.6030862 GeV.

2.5714 *5.6030862.

Compute 2*5.6030862=11.2061724.

0.5714 *5.6030862.

0.5 *5.6030862=2.8015431.

0.0714 *5.6030862 ≈0.4015.

So 2.8015431 +0.4015≈3.2030.

So total KE is 11.2061724 +3.2030≈14.40917 GeV.

But the options don't have 14 GeV, so perhaps that's not the case. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy.

Hmm. So I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 20.011 GeV. But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the mass is taken as 6 nucleons, each of 1 GeV/c². But that's unlikely, as 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 *0.9315 GeV/c². Let's see: 6 *0.9315=5.589 GeV, which is close to our earlier calculation.

So gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 *5.589=?

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589≈3.198.

So about 16.767 +3.198=20.065 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.065 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132). Hmm.

But wait, using the exact mass, we have E=20.011 GeV, which is about 20.01.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, beta is 0.96. Let me compute gamma accurately using the exact formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

So correct.

Hmm, maybe I should use a more precise calculation for the product 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Let me compute this using a more precise method.

3.57142857 *5.6030862.

Let me compute this as (3 + 0.57142857) * (5 + 0.6030862).

= 3*5 +3*0.6030862 +0.57142857*5 +0.57142857 *0.6030862.

Compute each term:

3*5 =15.

3*0.6030862 =1.8092586.

0.57142857 *5 =2.85714285.

0.57142857 *0.6030862 = compute this.

Let me approximate 0.57142857 *0.6030862.

0.5 *0.6030862 =0.3015431.

0.07142857 *0.6030862 ≈0.04311.

So total is approximately 0.3015431 +0.04311 =0.3446531.

Now, sum all terms:

15 +1.8092586=16.8092586,

16.8092586 +2.85714285=19.66640145,

19.66640145 +0.3446531=20.01105455 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV.

So the correct energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, but it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a more precise calculation, leading to a value around 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862 with more precise decimal places.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

3.57142857 ×5.6030862.

Let me write this as:

3.57142857  
×5.6030862  
____________  
We'll compute digit by digit.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: 

3.57142857 ×5.6030862 = ?

Well, perhaps using a calculator:

3.57142857 ×5.6030862.

I can use the fact that 3.57142857 ×5.6030862 = ?

Well, 3.57142857 = 25/7.

And 5.6030862 is approximately 5.603086.

So 25/7 ×5.603086 = (25 ×5.603086)/7.

Compute 25 ×5.603086=140.07715.

Divide by 7:140.07715 /7 ≈20.0110214 GeV.

So yes, approximately 20.011 GeV.

So the correct answer isn't among the options. Wait, but the options include option C: 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the mass of Li-6 again.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512234 u.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy more accurately.

Wait, 3.57142857 *5.6030862.

More precisely, let's compute 3.57142857 ×5.6030862.

Breaking it down:

Let me compute each digit's contribution.

3.57142857 ×5.6030862:

= 3 ×5 =15.

3 ×0.6 =1.8.

3 ×0.0030862 =0.0092586.

0.5 ×5=2.5.

0.5 ×0.6=0.3.

0.5 ×0.0030862=0.0015431.

0.07142857 ×5=0.35714285.

0.07142857 ×0.6=0.042857142.

0.07142857 ×0.0030862 ≈0.0002204.

Adding these:

15 +1.8 +0.0092586 =16.8092586.

Adding 2.5 +0.3 +0.0015431 =2.8015431.

Adding 0.35714285 +0.042857142 =0.4.

Adding 0.0002204.

So total:

16.8092586 +2.8015431 =19.6108017.

19.6108017 +0.4 =20.0108017.

20.0108017 +0.0002204 =20.0110221 GeV.

Hmm, so it's 20.0110221 GeV.

So, none of the options match precisely. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher by about 0.12 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another possibility is that the problem is considering the speed of the nucleons within the nucleus, but no, the question states the speed of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking per nucleon energy, but no, the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic momentum, but the question is about energy, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c. But in particle physics, c is taken as 1 in units where c=1, but when converting to GeV, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps my calculation is missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects to calculate using beta=0.96, and using gamma = (1-beta^2)^(-1/2).

But perhaps I should compute it with more precise decimal places.

Wait, beta is exactly 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216, and 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, perhaps it's 931.52 MeV/u, a more precise value.

So 6.01512234 u *931.52 MeV/u = ?

6.01512234 *931.52 = let me compute.

6 *931.52 =5589.12 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.52 = ?

0.01 *931.52=9.3152.

0.005 *931.52=4.6576.

0.00012234 *931.52≈0.1137.

So adding: 9.3152 +4.6576=13.9728 +0.1137=14.0865 MeV.

So total is 5589.12 +14.0865=5603.2065 MeV → 5.6032065 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6032065.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6032065.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6032065.

Again, breaking it down:

3*5.6032065=16.8096195.

0.57142857 *5.6032065.

Compute 0.5 *5.6032065=2.80160325.

0.07142857 *5.6032065 ≈0.401718.

So total 2.80160325 +0.401718=3.20332125.

Add to 16.8096195:16.8096195 +3.20332125=20.01294075 GeV.

Hmm, now it's 20.0129 GeV.

Still, the option closest is C:20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in the format of four decimal places, but in the options, some are given to three decimal places. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6032065 with higher precision.

3.57142857 ×5.6032065:

= (3 + 0.57142857) × (5 + 0.6032065)

= 3×5 +3×0.6032065 +0.57142857×5 +0.57142857 ×0.6032065.

Compute each term:

3×5=15.

3×0.6032065=1.8096195.

0.57142857×5=2.85714285.

0.57142857×0.6032065.

Compute this part precisely:

0.57142857 ×0.6032065.

=0.5×0.6032065 +0.07142857×0.6032065.

0.5×0.6032065=0.30160325.

0.07142857×0.6032065.

Compute 0.07 ×0.6032065=0.042224455.

0.00142857 ×0.6032065≈0.0008625.

So total around 0.042224455 +0.0008625 ≈0.043086955.

So 0.30160325 +0.043086955≈0.344690205.

Now, summing all terms:

15 +1.8096195=16.8096195.

16.8096195 +2.85714285=19.66676235.

19.66676235 +0.344690205=20.01145255 GeV.

So approximately 20.01145 GeV.

Hmm. So the precise calculation gives about 20.011 GeV, but none of the options match. The closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the mass is 6.01512234 u. Maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, looking up the exact mass of Li-6: it's 6.01512234 u. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for c. For example, sometimes c is taken as 3e8 m/s, but in units where c=1, it's already accounted for.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation seems to give approximately 20.011 GeV, but the options don't have that. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is calculated as gamma * m c², where m is the mass of the nucleus in kg, and then converted to GeV. But that's the same as using m c² in GeV.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for 931.5 MeV/u. Let me use 931.52 MeV/u.

So m c²=6.01512234 *931.52 MeV = ?

Let me compute 6.01512234 ×931.52.

= (6 + 0.01512234) ×931.52.

=6×931.52=5589.12 MeV.

0.01512234 ×931.52= let's compute.

0.01 ×931.52=9.3152.

0.005 ×931.52=4.6576.

0.00012234 ×931.52≈0.1137.

Adding:9.3152 +4.6576=13.9728 +0.1137=14.0865 MeV.

So total m c²=5589.12 +14.0865=5603.2065 MeV=5.6032065 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 ×5.6032065.

Again, 3.57142857 ×5.6032065.

As before, it comes to about 20.011 GeV.

So I'm confident that the correct energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the problem is using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

The kinetic energy (KE) is E - m c² = gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma-1) m c².

So KE = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6032065 GeV.

=2.57142857 *5.6032065.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.6032065.

=2 ×5.6032065=11.206413.

0.57142857 ×5.6032065 ≈3.203321.

So KE≈11.206413 +3.203321=14.409734 GeV.

So if the problem is asking for KE, the answer is about 14.41 GeV. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. However, I'm not sure why the calculation isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is not moving at 0.96c, but each nucleon is moving at 0.96c. But that's not the case; the nucleus as a whole moves at that speed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass used is the mass per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. But that would give a larger mass, leading to a higher energy.

For example, Li-6 has 6 nucleons. Mass per nucleon is approximately 1.007276 u. So 6 ×1.007276=6.043656 u. Then m c²=6.043656 ×931.5 MeV=6.043656 ×0.9315 GeV=5.636 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, so E=3.5714 ×5.636=20.138 GeV.

Ah! So that would give approximately 20.138 GeV, which matches option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the rest mass I used earlier was the exact mass of Li-6, which is 6.01512 u. But perhaps the problem is assuming each nucleon has a mass of about 1 GeV/c², so 6 ×1 GeV=6 GeV, leading to E=3.5714 ×6=21.428 GeV, which would be option D:21.419 GeV. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons without considering binding energy. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: ~1.007276 u each, neutron: ~1.008665 u each.

3×1.007276=3.021828 u.

3×1.008665=3.025995 u.

Total:6.047823 u.

So m c²=6.047823 u ×931.5 MeV/u=6.047823 ×0.9315 GeV=5.6435 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714, so E=3.5714 ×5.6435=?

3.5714 ×5=17.857.

3.5714 ×0.6435=?

0.6 ×3.5714=2.14284.

0.0435 ×3.5714≈0.1553.

So total 2.14284 +0.1553≈2.29814.

So E=17.857 +2.29814≈20.155 GeV.

Which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using this approach, leading to approximately 20.155 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV as option C.

But wait, the exact calculation using the actual nuclear mass gives 20.011 GeV, but using the sum of individual nucleon masses gives around 20.155 GeV. So perhaps the problem expects the latter approach.

But why would the problem do that? Because in reality, the nuclear mass is less than the sum of the individual nucleon masses due to binding energy. So the correct approach is to use the nuclear mass.

But perhaps the problem is not considering binding energy and just uses the sum of nucleon masses. In that case, the answer would be option C:20.132 GeV.

So, given that, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6.01512 u. The rest energy of the nucleus is calculated as:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.01512 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor, \(\gamma\), is determined from the velocity \(v = 0.96c\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
\]

The total energy of the relativistic nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6031 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This calculation assumes the exact nuclear mass of Li-6 (6.01512 u) and does not account for binding energy corrections. However, none of the provided options exactly match this result. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which may arise if the problem assumes the sum of individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without considering binding energy. Using this approach:

- Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
- The mass of a proton is approximately \(1.007276 \, \text{u}\), and the mass of a neutron is approximately \(1.008665 \, \text{u}\).
- Total mass of the nucleus: \(3 \times 1.007276 + 3 \times 1.008665 = 6.047823 \, \text{u}\).
- Rest energy: \(6.047823 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.6435 \, \text{GeV}\).
- Total energy: \(\gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6435 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.155 \, \text{GeV}\).

This result is close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. Given the discrepancy between the exact nuclear mass and the sum of nucleon masses, the problem likely assumes the latter approach. Thus, the best answer is:

**Answer: C**
