Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to understand what's going on.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I know that C3H6 could be either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane. But since the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride, which is a solvent used in bromination. Wait, wait, no, carbon tetrachloride is actually the solvent for bromination when using Br2. So, bromination of alkenes is typically an addition reaction, right? So that suggests that compound A is an alkene.

So, if A is propene, its structure is CH2=CH2CH3. Then, when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, it would add bromine across the double bond. The product would be 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, no, adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add across the double bond. So it would become CH2BrCHBrCH3, I think. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and if B is a dibromide, this reaction is probably an elimination reaction. So, B is a vicinal dibromide (two adjacent Br atoms). When treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation, an E2 elimination. So, each Br would be removed, and a double bond would form. The product C would be an alkene again. But wait, propene is an alkene. If we eliminate two Br atoms, where would the double bond form? Let me think. The initial structure after addition was CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When we eliminate HBr, which H would it take? Probably the adjacent H to each Br.

So, eliminating H from each adjacent carbon, so the double bond would form between carbons 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Let me visualize it. The structure after bromination is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH (alcoholic) is added, each Br is a leaving group. So, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the possible products would be 1,2 elimination, giving either 1-propene (propene) or maybe 2-propene (which is the same as propene, since propene is CH2=CHCH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is propene, so after bromination and elimination, we might get back propene, but perhaps more substituted? Or maybe some rearrangement occurs?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the starting material. Compound A is C3H6, so it's either propene or cyclopropane. But if it's cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4? I think bromination of cyclopropane would be more about ring-opening. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I'm more confident that A is propene because that's a more straightforward scenario. So after elimination, it would form propene again, maybe with some isomerism. Wait, but propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Alternatively, if the elimination leads to a different structure, like if the double bond shifts.

Wait, maybe the dibromide could form another alkene. Let me think: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When we eliminate HBr from each end, we could get either CH2=CHCH3 (which is propene) or maybe CH3CH2CH2Br? No, that's not possible because that would require a single elimination, but we have two Br atoms.

Wait, perhaps the elimination would form 1,2-dibromide into propene. So, maybe compound C is propene, same as A.

Then, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, red-hot iron tube. I think that's a setup for a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but wait, if C is propene, then passing through red-hot iron might not make sense. Wait, another possibility—maybe it's a reaction where an alkene is dehydrohalogenated further. Or perhaps, it's a way to form an alkyne via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but propene is an alkene. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the reaction is more about breaking the double bond. Oh, wait, maybe I'm wrong about compound C.

Wait, let's backtrack. If A is propene, and B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then when B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming an alkyne. Because when you have a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs), elimination of two molecules of HBr can form an alkyne. Oh, right! So, the reaction would be dehydrohalogenation twice, forming an alkyne. So, compound C would be propyne (CH≡CCH3).

Wait, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you brominate it, you'd get 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CHBrCH3. Then, eliminating two HBr from adjacent Brs would form CH≡CCH3, which is propyne. So, compound C is propyne.

Then, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a setup for dehydrohalogenation, but wait, propyne is an alkyne. Alternatively, maybe the iron is for hydrogenation? No, because the question says the tube is red-hot. Oh, wait, I think another reaction: maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a diene? Hmm, not sure. Wait, another thought: when an alkyne is heated with a metal like iron, maybe it's hydrogenated to an alkane. But that wouldn't make sense here. Alternatively, maybe it's converting the alkyne into an alkyne again but in a different position.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound C. Let me reevaluate. So, when B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and treated with alcoholic KOH, what happens? Vicinal dihalide with KOH (alcohol) leads to elimination of two HBr's, forming an alkyne. So, you get propyne (CH≡CH2CH3?), wait, no, propyne is CH3C≡CH. Wait, wait, the structure of propyne is actually CH≡C-CH3. So when 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3) is treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr and form CH≡C-CH3. So, compound C is propyne.

Now, passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, what does that do? I think that when alkynes are passed through a red-hot iron tube, they might undergo a process called dehydrohalogenation, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to produce an alkyne again. Wait, perhaps the iron is used for another elimination? Or maybe the alkyne is being converted into something else. Wait, perhaps the alkyne is being hydrogenated into an alkane? But I don't think that's the case here, because the next step involves treating with strong acids.

Alternatively, maybe the propyne is being converted into a different alkyne. Wait, perhaps the propyne is reacting with something else. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Wait, but propyne is already an alkyne; I'm not sure. Maybe the reaction is forming an alkyne from an alkene? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a step. Let's think: after getting propyne (C), then passing through a red-hot iron tube. What reaction happens when you pass an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube? Maybe it's a way to form a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form an aromatic compound, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go through the steps again.

Compound A: C3H6. Let's say it's propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in CCl4 would add Br2 across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3). Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH (a strong base), it eliminates two HBr molecules. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a triple bond. Hence, compound C is propyne (CH≡CCH3).

Then, compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, propyne is an alkyne. Wait, another thought: maybe the iron tube is for hydrogenation? But that would require H2 as well. If the alkyne is hydrogenated, it would form an alkane, but that doesn't fit with the next steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a diene. Wait, but how? Maybe via a reaction with O2 or another reagent. Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated, but that's usually done with a strong base, not a red-hot iron.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a way to produce an alkyne from an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps to see where I'm going. After compound D, it reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric acid, which together form a nitration mixture. So, perhaps compound D is undergoing nitration.

Then, compound E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. That sounds like a reduction reaction. The presence of Fe and HCl usually leads to the formation of H2 gas, but in this case, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation or some other reduction.

Compound F then reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. So if F is an aromatic amine, then G would be a diazonium salt.

Then, when G reacts with NaOH, it forms H. That might be a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps forming a phenol or a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

Wait, let's try to track each step again:

1. A (C3H6) → B (dibromide) via bromination in CCl4.
2. B → C via alcoholic KOH, which is elimination → alkyne (propyne).
3. C → D via red-hot iron. Maybe D is a diene? Or maybe it's an alkane. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong here.

Wait, maybe the reaction in step 3 is dehydrohalogenation again, but from an alkyne. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being hydrogenated to an alkene. So, propyne (CH≡CCH3) would become cis or trans propene?

Wait, but then what would happen next. Let's try that. If D is a propene, then reacting with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) would nitrate the alkene. So D would be an alkene, and E would be a nitro compound.

Wait, but let me try to think of each step again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider that compound A is cyclopropane (C3H6). But cyclopropane is less likely because bromination under such conditions might not proceed as an addition. Alternatively, if A is cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4 might lead to a ring-opening. For example, cyclopropane could react with Br2 to form 1-bromopropane? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the bromine adds across one of the ring bonds, opening the ring and adding two Br atoms. So, if cyclopropane (C3H6) reacts with Br2, it could form 1,2-dibromopropane again. Then, same as before, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would form an alkyne (propyne), and so on. But that leads to the same pathway as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm wrong about the product when B is treated with alcoholic KOH. Let's recheck: B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr's, forming an alkyne. So, yes, compound C is propyne (CH≡CCH3).

Then, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm. Wait, I think I've read that when an alkyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it can cause a reaction that converts the alkyne into an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's hydrogenation, but that requires H2. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated, but that usually requires a strong base like BuLi or something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being heated with the iron to cause some kind of rearrangement or isomerization. For example, propyne (CH3-C≡CH) is an alkyne. When heated with iron, perhaps it forms a different alkyne. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a trans-alkene via some mechanism. Or maybe it's a way to produce a different compound altogether. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next step. After D, which is the product of C through the iron tube, it reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. The two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3, which is a typical nitrating mixture. So, D must be something that can undergo nitration, like an aromatic compound or an alkene.

Wait, but if D is an alkene, nitration would occur on the double bond. For example, propene could undergo nitration to form nitropropene. But then, when F is formed by reacting E with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a reduction. For example, nitroalkane could be reduced to an amine.

Wait, let's outline the possible structures again:

A: propene → CH2=CHCH3.

B: 1,2-dibromopropane → BrCH2CHBrCH3.

C: propyne → CH≡CCH3.

D: ? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying D. If C is propyne, and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I don't think that's applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, but that would be CH3CH2CH3. But then, reacting an alkane with strong acids doesn't make sense for nitration. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe D is benzene? No, how would propyne become benzene? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction here.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's think about the entire sequence. The final steps involve nitrous acid and sodium hydroxide. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is involved in diazotization, which usually occurs with aromatic amines. So, if F is an aromatic amine, then G would be a diazonium salt. Then, H would be the product of diazonium salt hydrolysis, which could be a phenol or a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

So, let's try to see:

If F is an aromatic amine, then G is its diazonium salt, and H is phenol or something similar.

So, working backwards, E must be an amine when reacted with Fe and HCl. But wait, E is the product of D reacting with two strong acids. So, perhaps D is a benzene ring with a substituent, and E is a nitro compound. Then, E is reduced to form F, which is an amine.

Wait, but how do we get from C to D to E being a nitro compound?

Let me try to think of each step. So, from C (propyne) → D via red-hot iron. Then D is perhaps benzene? Because one of the options suggests that H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride, which implies phenolphthalein or something indicating a phenol. Wait, no, phenol would give a color with FeCl3. Alternatively, if H is benzene sulfonic acid or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with the red-hot iron is a way to form a benzene ring. How? Maybe through a dehydrohalogenation forming a benzene ring. But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne (C) is being converted into a benzene ring via a cyclization reaction. But I don't see how CH≡CCH3 would form benzene.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let me list each compound and possible structures.

A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3) → B is 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3).

C: elimination from B → propyne (CH3-C≡CH).

D: passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube → perhaps propene (CH2=CHCH3) is formed. Wait, but how? Because heating an alkyne might cause decomposition.

Wait, another possibility: when an alkyne is treated with a red-hot iron, perhaps it's hydrogenated to an alkane. So, propyne becomes propane (CH3CH2CH3). But then, D is propane, which is an alkane. Reacting an alkane with strong acids like H2SO4 and HNO3 wouldn't typically lead to anything. So that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkene. So, propyne → propene. How? Maybe via hydrogenation, but again, that would need H2 and a catalyst. But the question says red-hot iron, not hydrogenation conditions. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options given and see if that helps.

The options are about the correctness of statements A to D.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is an aromatic amine, then yes, because many dyes are synthesized using aromatic amines (like aniline derivatives).

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is a phenol, then phenol would react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color (the phenol-FeCl3 complex). So B would be correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is an alkyne, like propyne, then in NMR, the protons on either end of the triple bond would be split. Wait, the structure of propyne is CH3-C≡C-H. The CH3 group would show up as a singlet, and the H on the other end would also be a singlet. So, the NMR would have two singlets: one for the CH3 and one for the H. So C would be correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. Propyne is a gas, but is it flammable? Yes, alkynes are flammable. So D would be correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the incorrect statement. So which one is incorrect?

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, all the options A to D are correct statements. But the question is about the incorrect statement, so one of them is wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Let me consider each option.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. From earlier, C is propyne, which is a gas. Alkynes are indeed flammable, so D is correct.

Wait, but the options are about the products. Maybe I got some steps wrong. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that A is propene is wrong. Let me consider that A is cyclopropane (C3H6). So, cyclopropane brominating in CCl4. Wait, bromine adds to cyclopropane, but how? I think cyclopropane has a very strained ring, so bromine might add across one of the bonds, opening the ring. So, cyclopropane + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (same as before). Then, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs to form propyne. So, same as before.

Then, propyne through red-hot iron. Hmm. Maybe the alkyne is being converted into something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne (propyne) undergoes a reaction to form a different alkyne. For example, maybe it's a way to form an internal alkyne from a terminal one. But I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a benzene ring. Wait, that's not chemically feasible without some kind of aromatic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing the alkyne to polymerize, forming some carbon chain. But that's probably not leading to anything useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product after the red-hot iron. Let's think about D: if D is propane, then E would be the product of propane reacting with two strong acids, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps D is propene.

Wait, if D is propene, then E would be a nitro compound. So, propene would undergo nitration to form nitropropene. Then, E is nitropropene.

Then, E is treated with Fe and HCl to form F. Nitropropene would reduce to propylamine. So, F would be CH2CH2CH3NH2, but that's not possible as it's a primary amine. Wait, no, wait. Nitroalkane would reduce to an amine. So, nitropropene (CH2=CHCH2NO2) would reduce to CH2=CHCH2NH2.

Then, F (CH2=CHCH2NH2) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Diazotization occurs under cold, acidic conditions. So, G would be the diazonium salt: CH2=CHCH2N2+Cl^-.

Then, G is treated with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. Since this is aqueous NaOH and perhaps heat, it might form a carboxylic acid. Wait, the diazonium salt of a primary amine would typically decompose to form an acid.

Wait, CH2=CHCH2NH2 → diazonium salt → decomposition would form CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid).

So, H would be propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH). Then, option B says H gives yellow color with ferric chloride. Propenoic acid has a carboxylic group and a double bond. It would react with FeCl3, but would it give a yellow color? Phenols give a reddish-brown color with FeCl3. Carboxylic acids might not show such a color, unless they are aromatic. So, if H is propenoic acid, it might not give a yellow color with FeCl3. Therefore, option B would be incorrect.

But wait, the options are about the products. Let me check each option again.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. If H is propenoic acid, it's a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So, it wouldn't give the yellow color. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Wait, but then I have to see which product is H. H is the product of G (diazonium salt) reacting with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis: if the amine was primary, the hydrolysis would produce a carboxylic acid. So, H is propenoic acid.

So, propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH) is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids don't react with FeCl3 to give colors. Phenols do, giving a reddish-brown color. So, H would not give a yellow color with FeCl3 solution. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH₂CHBrCH₃) as Compound B. When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a vicinal dihalide elimination occurs, resulting in the formation of propyne (CH≡CCH₃) as Compound C.

Compound C (propyne) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube. This step likely involves the conversion of the terminal alkyne (propyne) into an internal alkyne, but the exact mechanism is unclear. For the purposes of this analysis, Compound D is assumed to be an alkene, likely propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), based on the subsequent reaction steps.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely sulfuric and nitric acids), leading to the nitration of the alkene. This forms a nitroalkane, such as nitropropene (CH₂=CHCH₂NO₂), as Compound E. When Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, it undergoes reduction, converting the nitro group into an amine. This forms a primary amine, such as propylamine (CH₂=CHCH₂NH₂), as Compound F.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), leading to the formation of a diazonium salt (CH₂=CHCH₂N₂⁺Cl⁻) as Compound G. Finally, when Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it undergoes hydrolysis, forming a carboxylic acid, specifically propenoic acid (CH₂=CHCOOH), as Compound H.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is an aromatic amine, this statement would be correct. However, in this sequence, F is a primary amine (propylamine), which is not typically used for dye synthesis. This makes the statement incorrect.
- **Option B:** H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. H is propenoic acid, a carboxylic acid, which does not react with ferric chloride to give a yellow color. Phenols, not carboxylic acids, give a yellow or reddish-brown color with ferric chloride. This makes the statement incorrect.
- **Option C:** D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. If D is propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), the protons on the double-bonded carbons (CH₂ and CH) would each appear as singlets in the NMR spectrum. This makes the statement correct.
- **Option D:** C is a flammable gas. C is propyne (CH≡CCH₃), which is a flammable gas. This makes the statement correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since only one option can be chosen, the most relevant incorrect statement is **B**, as it directly contradicts the properties of Compound H.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to understand what's going on.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I know that C3H6 could be either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane. But since the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride, which is a solvent used in bromination. Wait, wait, no, carbon tetrachloride is actually the solvent for bromination when using Br2. So, bromination of alkenes is typically an addition reaction, right? So that suggests that compound A is an alkene.

So, if A is propene, its structure is CH2=CH2CH3. Then, when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, it would add bromine across the double bond. The product would be 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, no, adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add across the double bond. So it would become CH2BrCHBrCH3, I think. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and if B is a dibromide, this reaction is probably an elimination reaction. So, B is a vicinal dibromide (two adjacent Br atoms). When treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation, an E2 elimination. So, each Br would be removed, and a double bond would form. The product C would be an alkene again. But wait, propene is an alkene. If we eliminate two Br atoms, where would the double bond form? Let me think. The initial structure after addition was CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When we eliminate HBr, which H would it take? Probably the adjacent H to each Br.

So, eliminating H from each adjacent carbon, so the double bond would form between carbons 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Let me visualize it. The structure after bromination is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH (alcoholic) is added, each Br is a leaving group. So, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the possible products would be 1,2 elimination, giving either 1-propene (propene) or maybe 2-propene (which is the same as propene, since propene is CH2=CHCH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is propene, so after bromination and elimination, we might get back propene, but perhaps more substituted? Or maybe some rearrangement occurs?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the starting material. Compound A is C3H6, so it's either propene or cyclopropane. But if it's cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4? I think bromination of cyclopropane would be more about ring-opening. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I'm more confident that A is propene because that's a more straightforward scenario. So after elimination, it would form propene again, maybe with some isomerism. Wait, but propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Alternatively, if the elimination leads to a different structure, like if the double bond shifts.

Wait, maybe the dibromide could form another alkene. Let me think: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When we eliminate HBr from each end, we could get either CH2=CHCH3 (which is propene) or maybe CH3CH2CH2Br? No, that's not possible because that would require a single elimination, but we have two Br atoms.

Wait, perhaps the elimination would form 1,2-dibromide into propene. So, maybe compound C is propene, same as A.

Then, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, red-hot iron tube. I think that's a setup for a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but wait, if C is propene, then passing through red-hot iron might not make sense. Wait, another possibility—maybe it's a reaction where an alkene is dehydrohalogenated further. Or perhaps, it's a way to form an alkyne via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but propene is an alkene. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the reaction is more about breaking the double bond. Oh, wait, maybe I'm wrong about compound C.

Wait, let's backtrack. If A is propene, and B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then when B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming an alkyne. Because when you have a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs), elimination of two molecules of HBr can form an alkyne. Oh, right! So, the reaction would be dehydrohalogenation twice, forming an alkyne. So, compound C would be propyne (CH≡CCH3).

Wait, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you brominate it, you'd get 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CHBrCH3. Then, eliminating two HBr from adjacent Brs would form CH≡CCH3, which is propyne. So, compound C is propyne.

Then, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a setup for dehydrohalogenation, but wait, propyne is an alkyne. Alternatively, maybe the iron is for hydrogenation? No, because the question says the tube is red-hot. Oh, wait, I think another reaction: maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a diene? Hmm, not sure. Wait, another thought: when an alkyne is heated with a metal like iron, maybe it's hydrogenated to an alkane. But that wouldn't make sense here. Alternatively, maybe it's converting the alkyne into an alkyne again but in a different position.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound C. Let me reevaluate. So, when B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and treated with alcoholic KOH, what happens? Vicinal dihalide with KOH (alcohol) leads to elimination of two HBr's, forming an alkyne. So, you get propyne (CH≡CH2CH3?), wait, no, propyne is CH3C≡CH. Wait, wait, the structure of propyne is actually CH≡C-CH3. So when 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3) is treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr and form CH≡C-CH3. So, compound C is propyne.

Now, passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, what does that do? I think that when alkynes are passed through a red-hot iron tube, they might undergo a process called dehydrohalogenation, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to produce an alkyne again. Wait, perhaps the iron is used for another elimination? Or maybe the alkyne is being converted into something else. Wait, perhaps the alkyne is being hydrogenated into an alkane? But I don't think that's the case here, because the next step involves treating with strong acids.

Alternatively, maybe the propyne is being converted into a different alkyne. Wait, perhaps the propyne is reacting with something else. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Wait, but propyne is already an alkyne; I'm not sure. Maybe the reaction is forming an alkyne from an alkene? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a step. Let's think: after getting propyne (C), then passing through a red-hot iron tube. What reaction happens when you pass an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube? Maybe it's a way to form a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form an aromatic compound, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go through the steps again.

Compound A: C3H6. Let's say it's propene (CH2=CHCH3). Bromination in CCl4 would add Br2 across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3). Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH (a strong base), it eliminates two HBr molecules. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a triple bond. Hence, compound C is propyne (CH≡CCH3).

Then, compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, propyne is an alkyne. Wait, another thought: maybe the iron tube is for hydrogenation? But that would require H2 as well. If the alkyne is hydrogenated, it would form an alkane, but that doesn't fit with the next steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a diene. Wait, but how? Maybe via a reaction with O2 or another reagent. Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated, but that's usually done with a strong base, not a red-hot iron.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a way to produce an alkyne from an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps to see where I'm going. After compound D, it reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric acid, which together form a nitration mixture. So, perhaps compound D is undergoing nitration.

Then, compound E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. That sounds like a reduction reaction. The presence of Fe and HCl usually leads to the formation of H2 gas, but in this case, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation or some other reduction.

Compound F then reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. So if F is an aromatic amine, then G would be a diazonium salt.

Then, when G reacts with NaOH, it forms H. That might be a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps forming a phenol or a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

Wait, let's try to track each step again:

1. A (C3H6) → B (dibromide) via bromination in CCl4.
2. B → C via alcoholic KOH, which is elimination → alkyne (propyne).
3. C → D via red-hot iron. Maybe D is a diene? Or maybe it's an alkane. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong here.

Wait, maybe the reaction in step 3 is dehydrohalogenation again, but from an alkyne. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being hydrogenated to an alkene. So, propyne (CH≡CCH3) would become cis or trans propene?

Wait, but then what would happen next. Let's try that. If D is a propene, then reacting with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) would nitrate the alkene. So D would be an alkene, and E would be a nitro compound.

Wait, but let me try to think of each step again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider that compound A is cyclopropane (C3H6). But cyclopropane is less likely because bromination under such conditions might not proceed as an addition. Alternatively, if A is cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4 might lead to a ring-opening. For example, cyclopropane could react with Br2 to form 1-bromopropane? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the bromine adds across one of the ring bonds, opening the ring and adding two Br atoms. So, if cyclopropane (C3H6) reacts with Br2, it could form 1,2-dibromopropane again. Then, same as before, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would form an alkyne (propyne), and so on. But that leads to the same pathway as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm wrong about the product when B is treated with alcoholic KOH. Let's recheck: B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr's, forming an alkyne. So, yes, compound C is propyne (CH≡CCH3).

Then, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm. Wait, I think I've read that when an alkyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it can cause a reaction that converts the alkyne into an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's hydrogenation, but that requires H2. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated, but that usually requires a strong base like BuLi or something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being heated with the iron to cause some kind of rearrangement or isomerization. For example, propyne (CH3-C≡CH) is an alkyne. When heated with iron, perhaps it forms a different alkyne. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a trans-alkene via some mechanism. Or maybe it's a way to produce a different compound altogether. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next step. After D, which is the product of C through the iron tube, it reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. The two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3, which is a typical nitrating mixture. So, D must be something that can undergo nitration, like an aromatic compound or an alkene.

Wait, but if D is an alkene, nitration would occur on the double bond. For example, propene could undergo nitration to form nitropropene. But then, when F is formed by reacting E with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a reduction. For example, nitroalkane could be reduced to an amine.

Wait, let's outline the possible structures again:

A: propene → CH2=CHCH3.

B: 1,2-dibromopropane → BrCH2CHBrCH3.

C: propyne → CH≡CCH3.

D: ? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying D. If C is propyne, and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I don't think that's applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, but that would be CH3CH2CH3. But then, reacting an alkane with strong acids doesn't make sense for nitration. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe D is benzene? No, how would propyne become benzene? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction here.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's think about the entire sequence. The final steps involve nitrous acid and sodium hydroxide. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is involved in diazotization, which usually occurs with aromatic amines. So, if F is an aromatic amine, then G would be a diazonium salt. Then, H would be the product of diazonium salt hydrolysis, which could be a phenol or a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

So, let's try to see:

If F is an aromatic amine, then G is its diazonium salt, and H is phenol or something similar.

So, working backwards, E must be an amine when reacted with Fe and HCl. But wait, E is the product of D reacting with two strong acids. So, perhaps D is a benzene ring with a substituent, and E is a nitro compound. Then, E is reduced to form F, which is an amine.

Wait, but how do we get from C to D to E being a nitro compound?

Let me try to think of each step. So, from C (propyne) → D via red-hot iron. Then D is perhaps benzene? Because one of the options suggests that H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride, which implies phenolphthalein or something indicating a phenol. Wait, no, phenol would give a color with FeCl3. Alternatively, if H is benzene sulfonic acid or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with the red-hot iron is a way to form a benzene ring. How? Maybe through a dehydrohalogenation forming a benzene ring. But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne (C) is being converted into a benzene ring via a cyclization reaction. But I don't see how CH≡CCH3 would form benzene.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let me list each compound and possible structures.

A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3) → B is 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3).

C: elimination from B → propyne (CH3-C≡CH).

D: passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube → perhaps propene (CH2=CHCH3) is formed. Wait, but how? Because heating an alkyne might cause decomposition.

Wait, another possibility: when an alkyne is treated with a red-hot iron, perhaps it's hydrogenated to an alkane. So, propyne becomes propane (CH3CH2CH3). But then, D is propane, which is an alkane. Reacting an alkane with strong acids like H2SO4 and HNO3 wouldn't typically lead to anything. So that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkene. So, propyne → propene. How? Maybe via hydrogenation, but again, that would need H2 and a catalyst. But the question says red-hot iron, not hydrogenation conditions. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options given and see if that helps.

The options are about the correctness of statements A to D.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is an aromatic amine, then yes, because many dyes are synthesized using aromatic amines (like aniline derivatives).

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is a phenol, then phenol would react with FeCl3 to give a yellow color (the phenol-FeCl3 complex). So B would be correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is an alkyne, like propyne, then in NMR, the protons on either end of the triple bond would be split. Wait, the structure of propyne is CH3-C≡C-H. The CH3 group would show up as a singlet, and the H on the other end would also be a singlet. So, the NMR would have two singlets: one for the CH3 and one for the H. So C would be correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. Propyne is a gas, but is it flammable? Yes, alkynes are flammable. So D would be correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the incorrect statement. So which one is incorrect?

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, all the options A to D are correct statements. But the question is about the incorrect statement, so one of them is wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Let me consider each option.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. From earlier, C is propyne, which is a gas. Alkynes are indeed flammable, so D is correct.

Wait, but the options are about the products. Maybe I got some steps wrong. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that A is propene is wrong. Let me consider that A is cyclopropane (C3H6). So, cyclopropane brominating in CCl4. Wait, bromine adds to cyclopropane, but how? I think cyclopropane has a very strained ring, so bromine might add across one of the bonds, opening the ring. So, cyclopropane + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (same as before). Then, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs to form propyne. So, same as before.

Then, propyne through red-hot iron. Hmm. Maybe the alkyne is being converted into something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne (propyne) undergoes a reaction to form a different alkyne. For example, maybe it's a way to form an internal alkyne from a terminal one. But I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a benzene ring. Wait, that's not chemically feasible without some kind of aromatic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing the alkyne to polymerize, forming some carbon chain. But that's probably not leading to anything useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product after the red-hot iron. Let's think about D: if D is propane, then E would be the product of propane reacting with two strong acids, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps D is propene.

Wait, if D is propene, then E would be a nitro compound. So, propene would undergo nitration to form nitropropene. Then, E is nitropropene.

Then, E is treated with Fe and HCl to form F. Nitropropene would reduce to propylamine. So, F would be CH2CH2CH3NH2, but that's not possible as it's a primary amine. Wait, no, wait. Nitroalkane would reduce to an amine. So, nitropropene (CH2=CHCH2NO2) would reduce to CH2=CHCH2NH2.

Then, F (CH2=CHCH2NH2) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Diazotization occurs under cold, acidic conditions. So, G would be the diazonium salt: CH2=CHCH2N2+Cl^-.

Then, G is treated with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. Since this is aqueous NaOH and perhaps heat, it might form a carboxylic acid. Wait, the diazonium salt of a primary amine would typically decompose to form an acid.

Wait, CH2=CHCH2NH2 → diazonium salt → decomposition would form CH2=CHCOOH (propenoic acid).

So, H would be propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH). Then, option B says H gives yellow color with ferric chloride. Propenoic acid has a carboxylic group and a double bond. It would react with FeCl3, but would it give a yellow color? Phenols give a reddish-brown color with FeCl3. Carboxylic acids might not show such a color, unless they are aromatic. So, if H is propenoic acid, it might not give a yellow color with FeCl3. Therefore, option B would be incorrect.

But wait, the options are about the products. Let me check each option again.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. If H is propenoic acid, it's a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So, it wouldn't give the yellow color. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Wait, but then I have to see which product is H. H is the product of G (diazonium salt) reacting with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis: if the amine was primary, the hydrolysis would produce a carboxylic acid. So, H is propenoic acid.

So, propenoic acid (CH2=CHCOOH) is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids don't react with FeCl3 to give colors. Phenols do, giving a reddish-brown color. So, H would not give a yellow color with FeCl3 solution. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is option B.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH₂CHBrCH₃) as Compound B. When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a vicinal dihalide elimination occurs, resulting in the formation of propyne (CH≡CCH₃) as Compound C.

Compound C (propyne) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube. This step likely involves the conversion of the terminal alkyne (propyne) into an internal alkyne, but the exact mechanism is unclear. For the purposes of this analysis, Compound D is assumed to be an alkene, likely propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), based on the subsequent reaction steps.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely sulfuric and nitric acids), leading to the nitration of the alkene. This forms a nitroalkane, such as nitropropene (CH₂=CHCH₂NO₂), as Compound E. When Compound E is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, it undergoes reduction, converting the nitro group into an amine. This forms a primary amine, such as propylamine (CH₂=CHCH₂NH₂), as Compound F.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), leading to the formation of a diazonium salt (CH₂=CHCH₂N₂⁺Cl⁻) as Compound G. Finally, when Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it undergoes hydrolysis, forming a carboxylic acid, specifically propenoic acid (CH₂=CHCOOH), as Compound H.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is an aromatic amine, this statement would be correct. However, in this sequence, F is a primary amine (propylamine), which is not typically used for dye synthesis. This makes the statement incorrect.
- **Option B:** H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. H is propenoic acid, a carboxylic acid, which does not react with ferric chloride to give a yellow color. Phenols, not carboxylic acids, give a yellow or reddish-brown color with ferric chloride. This makes the statement incorrect.
- **Option C:** D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. If D is propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), the protons on the double-bonded carbons (CH₂ and CH) would each appear as singlets in the NMR spectrum. This makes the statement correct.
- **Option D:** C is a flammable gas. C is propyne (CH≡CCH₃), which is a flammable gas. This makes the statement correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since only one option can be chosen, the most relevant incorrect statement is **B**, as it directly contradicts the properties of Compound H.

**Answer: B**
