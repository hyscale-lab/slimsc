Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's talking about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. So this is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator, right?

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, each state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, and for the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized.

So first, I need to figure out the energy of the third excited state. In the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, which are the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, I think it's more accurate to consider the energy in terms of the radial part. Because in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no—actually, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three directions. Or wait, maybe it's E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is actually the radial quantum number? No, wait, I might be mixing it up with the hydrogen atom model.

Wait, no, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. Each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number, say nx, ny, nz, which are non-negative integers. The total energy is E = ħω(nx + ny + nz + 3/2). Or wait, maybe it's (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) times ħω. Because each direction contributes (n + 1/2) ħω, and adding all three gives (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, no, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so when you add them together, you get (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy levels are quantized in multiples of ħω, and each state is labeled by the sum of the quantum numbers.

But the question is about the third excited state. Wait, wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, and each excited state is higher than that. So the ground state is the first state, then the first excited, second excited, etc. So the third excited state would be the fourth level in order.

Wait, let me think. The ground state is the state with the lowest energy. Then the first excited state is the next higher, second, third, etc. So the third excited state is the fourth state when counting from zero.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. The energy levels are E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = nx + ny + nz, and nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers.

So the ground state is n=0, E = (3/2) ħω. Then n=1: E = (5/2) ħω. n=2: E=(7/2) ħω. n=3: E=(9/2) ħω. Wait, so n is the sum of the quantum numbers. Each time you increase n by 1, the energy increases by ħω. So the energy levels are spaced by ħω each, with each level having multiple states (degeneracy).

So the ground state is n=0: E=(3/2)ħω.

First excited state is n=1: E=(5/2) ħω.

Second excited state is n=2: E=(7/2) ħω.

Third excited state is n=3: E=(9/2) ħω.

So the third excited state's energy is (9/2) ħω. That's one part of the answer.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy, i.e., the degeneracy. So for each n, how many states are there with that n?

The number of states (degeneracy) for a given n is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers (nx, ny, nz), considering that the order matters because each quantum number is for a different direction.

So for n=3, how many triplets (nx, ny, nz) are there such that nx + ny + nz =3?

This is a combinatorial problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz =3 is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the harmonic oscillator has energy levels which depend on the sum of the quantum numbers, but in 3D, each direction is independent. So for each (nx, ny, nz), you have a unique state, but the energies might be the same for different triplets if their sums are the same.

Yes, so for n=3, the number of states is the combination with repetition formula, which is (n + k -1 choose k-1), where k is the number of variables (here, 3 directions). So for n=3, it's (3+3-1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 states.

Alternatively, you can list them:

Possible triplets (nx, ny, nz) where sum is 3.

They include:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 states.

(2,1,0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2) → 6 states.

(1,1,1) → 1 state.

Wait, adding them up: 3 +6 +1 =10. Yep, that's correct.

So the degeneracy is 10.

So looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10 functions. Option C says (9/2) ħω and 3 functions. So between A and C. Since the degeneracy is 10, the answer must be A.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) (9/2) ħω, 10 → yes.

Option B and D have the second term as something with pi and r, which doesn't make sense for the energy levels here because the harmonic oscillator's energy doesn't depend on r. So B and D can be eliminated.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass \( m \) in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which are non-negative integers. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right),
\]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways to distribute \( n \) quanta among the three directions, which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy of that state. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Among the given options, only option A matches these results. Options B and D are incorrect because they include terms involving \( \pi \) and \( r \), which are not relevant to the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator. Option C incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3 instead of 10.
