Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of it, one hemisphere, is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When we observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation look like they could be from an exoplanet. The question is asking, if there were a planet causing the same brightness dip, what would its radius be relative to the star?

So, the key here is to compare the brightness change caused by the spots to the brightness change caused by a planet. I remember that the transit method for exoplanets works because when a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness is what we detect. On the other hand, the spots cause a variation because when the spotted area is facing us, it's dimmer, making the overall star appear a bit dimmer, and when it rotates away, it gets brighter again.

Wait, but in this case, the star's brightness variation due to spots is being compared to the dip from a planet. So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude from a planet transit.

First, I should find the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the side facing us, the star's overall brightness is lower. But the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness variations.

The formula for the brightness change (ΔF) when a spot is present is related to the area of the spot and the temperature difference. I remember that the flux from a star is proportional to the area and the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4). So, the change in flux would be the area of the spot multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area (ΔF = A * (F_spot - F_star)).

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so F_spot is less than F_star. Let me think about this. The star's total flux without spots is F_star_total = σT_eff^4 * (4π R_star^2). When there are spots, part of the surface is emitting less. So the total flux when the spots are facing us is F_total = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted) + (Area_spotted * F_spotted).

But wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the entire hemisphere is 2π R² (since a hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere). The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, meaning the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². Wait, no, wait. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total spotted area would be (filling factor) * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R², so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². 

Wait, but when the star rotates, only half of the spots (since it's one hemisphere) are visible at any one time. Or no, wait, if the entire hemisphere is covered, then when the star rotates such that the other hemisphere comes into view, the spots are no longer visible. But the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots; when it's rotated away, the spots are not visible. So the variation is due to the spots coming into and out of view as the star rotates.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots' visibility changes. The brightness variation would be periodic with the star's rotation period. The maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us.

So the change in brightness when the spots are visible is the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are in view.

Let me compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4π R^2.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are covering 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². The flux from the unspotted part is (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * σ T_eff^4. The flux from the spots is 0.4π R² * σ (T_eff - ΔT)^4. Wait, no, the spots are cooler. So T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = [ (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * σ T_eff^4 ) ] + [ 0.4π R² * σ T_spot^4 ].

But wait, when the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, the entire 2π R² (the front) is either spotted or not. Wait, no: the spotted area is 0.4π R² on that hemisphere. So the total area of the front is 2π R², of which 0.4π R² is spots (so 1.6π R² is unspotted). So the flux is:

F = (1.6π R²) σ T_eff^4 + (0.4π R²) σ T_spot^4.

The normal flux (no spots visible) is when the other hemisphere is facing us, which has no spots. So F0 = 2π R² σ T_eff^4.

So the flux when the spots are visible is F = [ (1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ] * π R² σ T_eff^4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the difference as a fraction.

The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:

ΔF = (F - F0) / F0.

F0 = 2π R² σ Teff^4.

F = (1.6 π R² σ Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (Teff - 1000)^4 )

So F = π R² σ [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff -1000)^4 ]

So ΔF = [ F - F0 ] / F0 

= [ π R² σ (1.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 ) - 2π R² σ T^4 ) ] / (2π R² σ T^4 )

Simplify numerator:

= π R² σ [1.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 - 2 T^4 ] 

= π R² σ [ -0.4 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 ]

Factor out 0.4:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ] 

So ΔF = [0.4 π R² σ ( (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ) ] / [ 2 π R² σ T^4 ]

The R², π, σ terms cancel.

= 0.4 ( (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ) / (2 T^4 )

= [0.4 / 2 ] * [ ( (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ) / T^4 ]

= 0.2 * [ ( (Teff -1000)^4 / Teff^4 - 1 ) ]

= 0.2 * [ ( ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 - 1 ) ]

Since Teff is 6000 K, (Teff -1000) =5000 K.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Compute that: 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So (0.482253 - 1 ) = -0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * (-0.517747) ≈ -0.10355.

So the fractional change is about -0.10355, which is a 10.35% decrease in brightness when the spots are visible.

Wait, but that's the amplitude of the dip. Because when the spots are facing us, the brightness is lower than normal.

But the star's brightness variation would have a maximum when no spots are visible (F0) and a minimum when the spots are visible (F). So the amplitude is the difference between F0 and F, which is 0.1035 or about 10.35% dip.

Now, the planet transit scenario. The dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2. So the fractional dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, but wait. When a planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2 because it blocks that area. So the amplitude is (R_p / R_star)^2.

So if the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rs)^2, and the dip from the spots is 0.1035, then set (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. The dip is (R_p^2)/(R_star^2), because area is proportional to R squared. So the fractional change is (Rp/Rs)^2.

So 0.1035 is (Rp/Rs)^2. Taking square root: Rp/Rs ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32.

So the planet would have a radius about 0.32 times the star's radius to produce the same dip.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the star's brightness variation is being mistaken for an exoplanet. So the amplitude from the spots is similar to the amplitude from a planet. So the planet's radius would need to produce the same dip, which is 0.1035 in fractional brightness.

So sqrt(0.1035) is approximately 0.3217, so about 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

So the correct answer should be D.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, when the star is not covered by spots, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. So if the dip from the spots is 0.1035, which is the same as the dip from the planet, then Rp/Rs is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, so ~0.32.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness dip as the star's spotted hemisphere, we compare the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots to the dip caused by a planet.

### Step 1: Fractional brightness change due to spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's ($R_\text{star}$) and an effective temperature of $T_\text{eff} = 6000 \, \text{K}$. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, with a temperature difference of $\Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K}$, making the spot temperature $T_\text{spot} = 5000 \, \text{K}$. The total surface area of the star is $4\pi R_\text{star}^2$, and the spotted area is $0.2 \times 2\pi R_\text{star}^2 = 0.4\pi R_\text{star}^2$.

The total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
\[
F = (1.6\pi R_\text{star}^2 \cdot \sigma T_\text{eff}^4) + (0.4\pi R_\text{star}^2 \cdot \sigma T_\text{spot}^4),
\]
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The normal flux (no spots visible) is:
\[
F_0 = 2\pi R_\text{star}^2 \cdot \sigma T_\text{eff}^4.
\]

The fractional brightness change is:
\[
\Delta F = \frac{F - F_0}{F_0}.
\]

Substituting the expressions for $F$ and $F_0$:
\[
\Delta F = \frac{\pi R_\text{star}^2 \sigma \left[1.6 T_\text{eff}^4 + 0.4 T_\text{spot}^4 - 2 T_\text{eff}^4\right]}{2\pi R_\text{star}^2 \sigma T_\text{eff}^4}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\Delta F = 0.2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_\text{spot}^4 - T_\text{eff}^4}{T_\text{eff}^4}\right).
\]

Using $T_\text{spot} = 5000 \, \text{K}$ and $T_\text{eff} = 6000 \, \text{K}$:
\[
\frac{T_\text{spot}^4}{T_\text{eff}^4} = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
\]

Thus:
\[
\Delta F = 0.2 \cdot (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 \cdot (-0.5177) \approx -0.1035.
\]

The fractional brightness change is approximately $-0.1035$ or a 10.35% decrease in brightness when the spots are visible.

### Step 2: Brightness dip caused by a planet
The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
\[
\text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}}\right)^2.
\]

To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
\[
\left(\frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}}\right)^2 = 0.1035.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_\text{planet}}{R_\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately $0.32$. Comparing this to the options:

- **A)** ~0.39
- **B)** ~0.07
- **C)** ~0.11
- **D)** ~0.32

The correct answer is **D**.
