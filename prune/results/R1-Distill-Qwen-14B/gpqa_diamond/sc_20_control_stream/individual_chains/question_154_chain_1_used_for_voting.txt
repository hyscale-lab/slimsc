Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which structure corresponds to the spectral data given. Let me take it step by step.

The question describes an unknown white solid with some spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the spectral clues to one of them.

First, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156, which suggests the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak is just 2 mass units higher. That makes me think of something like a chlorine atom, since Cl is about 35, but wait, 156 + 2 is 158. Oh wait, Cl has an isotope at about 37, which is +2 from the more abundant 35Cl. So if the molecular ion is at 156, maybe the molecular formula has a Cl atom. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight. C is 12, H 1, Cl ~35, O 16. So 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35, 2*16=32. Total is 84+5=89 +35=124 +32=156. Oh, that's matching the molecular ion. So the molecular weight is 156 for option A.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its formula is C7H5ClO2 as well. Same molecular weight, so same as A. So the molecular ion would be 156 for B too.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. Formula is C8H7ClO2. Let's compute molecular weight: 8*12=96, 7*1=7, 35, 2*16=32. Total 96+7=103 +35=138 +32=170. So molecular ion would be 170, but the data shows 156. So option C is probably out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as A and B. So same molecular weight 156.

So A, B, D are possible; C is out because of higher molecular weight.

Next, the IR data. Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1, but sometimes a bit lower. For esters or aldehydes, it's around 1720. Wait, aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720, but an aldehyde would have a peak at around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch as well. But maybe the broad peak is due to an -OH group.

Looking at the options, A, B, D are either aldehydes with OH, or carboxylic acids.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl and Cl substituents. So it has a carbonyl (benzaldehyde), an OH group, and a Cl.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid with Cl. So the O-H would be in the IR as a broad peak, and the carbonyl (COOH) would be around 1700. But the IR here has 1720, which is a bit higher, more like an ester or aldehyde.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B in functional groups—a carboxylic acid. So same reasoning as B.

So the IR's strong sharp peak at 1720. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak is usually around 1680-1720. Wait, but sometimes if it's an acid, the carbonyl is a bit lower than an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone. But the other options don't have that.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The sharp peak at 1720 could be an ester or aldehyde. If it's an aldehyde, the O-H would be from where? Let's see option A: it's a hydroxybenzaldehyde. So it has both an aldehyde (which gives the 1720 peak) and an -OH (which gives the broad peak in IR). That fits.

In contrast, if the compound is a carboxylic acid (like B or D), the IR would show a very broad O-H peak (like a broad peak around 2500-3500 cm^-1, which is what the data shows), and the carbonyl would be around 1700. But the given data is 1720, higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. So maybe that suggests it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe a deprotonated form or something else. Or perhaps it's an ester.

Looking back, option C is phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. The carbonyl in an ester is around 1720-1750 cm^-1, which matches the IR data. But earlier, the molecular ion suggested it's too heavy, so C is out.

So, the IR data suggests either an aldehyde or an ester. But since the molecular weight is 156, and C is 170, it can't be C.

So back to the other options. So if the IR's 1720 is from an aldehyde, options A could fit. Because A is a benzaldehyde with a Cl and OH.

Now, the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

The peak at 11 ppm is a singlet. That's very downfield, which suggests an aldehyde proton or an -OH (but -OH protons are usually broad and might not appear sharp, unless in a deprotonated state or under certain conditions). Wait, but in the NMR, the 11ppm is a singlet. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but wait, 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, an -OH could be in that region, but again, it's a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, a singlet at 11 ppm for one proton. Could that be an aldehyde? Or maybe a phenolic OH? Let me think.

In option A, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the structure is o-hydroxy, chloro, and aldehyde. So the aldehyde proton would be at around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows 11.0 ppm. Hmm, that's a bit higher than typical aldehyde protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH, but that's usually broad, but here it's a singlet. Could it be a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to something else?

Wait, in the case of an aldehyde, the proton is usually around 9.5-10.5 ppm. If it's an acidic proton, like in a phenol, that's around 10-12 ppm, but that would be an -OH. But in the NMR, the peak is a singlet. Phenolic OHs are usually broad, but sometimes in certain conditions, like in DMSO, they can appear as sharp signals. But in this case, the solvent isn't mentioned, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the singlet at 11 ppm could be an acidic proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in that case, the -COOH would have a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the NMR peaks.

The 11 ppm (s, 1H) probably corresponds to what? Let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

In this compound, there's an aldehyde proton (probably around 9-10 ppm) and a hydroxyl proton (phenolic OH), which is acidic and can appear around 10-12 ppm. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0, which might be the OH. Alternatively, the aldehyde's proton might be a singlet at 11, but that's a bit high. Let me think about typical chemical shifts. Benzaldehyde's aldehyde proton is around 9.8-10.2 ppm. If it's substituted, perhaps in this case, the aldehyde is more deshielded and appears at 11.0. Alternatively, the OH could be at 11.0. However, the OH in phenol is usually around 5 ppm in the NMR, unless it's deprotonated. Wait, no. Wait, in the case of an aromatic alcohol (like phenol), the -OH proton can be around 4-7 ppm if it's an alcohol, but when it's conjugated (like in salicylic acid or derivatives), it can be more downfield. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR integration. The 11 ppm is 1H, which could be a single proton. The other peaks are for 2H each.

In option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The structure would have an aldehyde (CHO) group, which gives a singlet at around 10 ppm. Then, there's a hydroxyl (OH) group, which could be exchanging and maybe appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet. Another possibility is that the OH is split into a broad peak, but in the data provided, it's a singlet.

Alternatively, looking at the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those look like a pair of doublets, which suggests para substitution on the aromatic ring. Because two doublets with the same number of protons (each 2H) and same coupling would suggest a para-substituted benzene.

Wait, so the aromatic region in NMR: for a para-substituted benzene ring, you typically get two doublets. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the adjacent protons are each next to one substituent and couple with each other. So, in the case of para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps one substituent is at position 2 and 4, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, no. Let's think about 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure is Cl at position 4, and COOH at position 1. So the ring is substituted at position 4 (Cl) and position 1 (COOH). So the ring would have substituents in the para positions relative to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern.

But wait, in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.02 and 7.72. Each is a doublet for 2H. So let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions.

Alternatively, another scenario: the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of two equivalent protons each, leading to two doublets.

Hmm, perhaps in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has a Cl at position 4 and a COOH at position 1. The ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The protons adjacent to COOH would be in position 2 and 6, each adjacent to COOH. Then, the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl.

Wait, that might not result in two doublets. Let me think. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring is:

Positions:

1: COOH

2: H

3: H

4: Cl

5: H

6: H

Wait, no, that's not right. Benzoic acid has the COOH group at position 1. Then, the Cl is at position 4. So the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. So the ring is 1-COOH, 4-Cl. Then, the H in position 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

So for the aromatic protons:

The H in position 2 would be next to COOH and have a substituent in position 1. Similarly, position 6 is equivalent to 2. They would each be adjacent to substituents. So their chemical shifts would be similar. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are each adjacent to Cl. So each pair would be equivalent.

In that scenario, the H at positions 2 and 6 would be a pair, each as doublets. Similarly, H at positions 3 and 5 would be another pair of doublets. But wait, the NMR only shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but in the NMR, the higher ppm is 8.02, which is downfield, suggesting deshielded protons. Those would be the protons closer to electron-withdrawing groups. The Cl is electron-withdrawing, so the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be next to Cl. But wait, Cl is an EWG, so the para and ortho positions would have their protons deshielded, leading to higher ppm.

Wait, the COOH group is a strong EWG. So the protons next to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, so they would appear upfield or downfield? EWGs deactivate the ring and make the adjacent protons more deshielded, so higher ppm. So the H in positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear at higher ppm. Similarly, H in positions 3 and 5 would be near Cl, which is also EWG, so they would also be deshielded, but perhaps not as much as those near COOH.

Wait, but in the NMR, the higher ppm is 8.02, which is a doublet of 2H, and 7.72 is another doublet of 2H. So perhaps the higher ppm (8.02) corresponds to the protons adjacent to the COOH group, and the lower (7.72) could be the ones adjacent to Cl.

But let me think about each option:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The structure is benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4.

So the ring would have H at 2,3,5,6 positions.

H-2 and H-6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl.

H-3 and H-5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

So H-2 and H-6 would be more deshielded due to COOH, so they'd appear at higher ppm. H-3 and H-5 are near Cl, so also deshielded but perhaps not as much.

In the NMR, the two doublets are 8.02 (d,2H) and 7.72 (d,2H). Let's see which would be higher. The H closer to COOH are likely at a higher ppm. So perhaps 8.02 is H-2 and H-6, and 7.72 is H-3 and H-5.

Alternatively, in option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Then, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. Then, the H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

H-3 and H-6 are adjacent to Cl (position 2) and H-4 is between H-3 and H-5.

Wait, let me visualize this. The substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So H-3 and H-6 are ortho to Cl, and meta to COOH. H-4 and H-5 are in positions that are more distant.

In that case, the H-3 and H-6 would be next to Cl, which is EWG, so their protons would be downfield (higher ppm). H-4 and H-5 would be more shielded, perhaps, but not sure.

In the NMR, the two doublets are 8.02 (d,2H) and 7.72 (d,2H). So if the Cl is in position 2, the adjacent protons (at 3 and 6) would be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm. So they could be the 8.02 ppm doublet. The other doublet would be H-4 and H-5, which are in positions less deshielded, so 7.72 ppm.

But I'm not confident about this. Let me think about the correct NMR pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: looking at the NMR and the substitution pattern.

In the NMR, the two doublets could correspond to a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So for example, in a benzene ring where each substituent is opposite each other, such as two substituents at 1 and 3 positions, but that would give more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if one substituent is at position 1 and another at position 4, making it para, then the adjacent protons would be split into two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's see how that would look in the NMR.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. The ring protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. They would be more deshielded, so higher ppm. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Cl is EWG, so those protons would be deshielded but perhaps not as much as those next to COOH.

So for the NMR, the two doublets would be 8.02 (for the 2 and 6 H, each as a doublet) and 7.72 (3 and 5 H, each as a doublet). The coupling would be between adjacent H's; for a para-substituted benzene, the coupling between ortho H's would be around 8-9 Hz, which is typical.

But then, what about the 1H at 11.0 ppm? In benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak due to exchange with water, but in the NMR data, it's a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is deprotonated, so the COO^- wouldn't have a proton. But then, the molecular ion would change, but the molecular weight is 156, which is the same as the acid. So that's confusing.

Wait, another possibility: the 11.0 ppm peak could be the aldehyde proton. So if the structure is option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

In that case, the aldehyde proton is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet. The phenol OH could be exchanged and perhaps not appearing as a peak, or it's integrated into the 1H count. Wait, but the NMR only shows three peaks: 11 (1H), 8.02 (2H), 7.72 (2H). So the total is 5H. The molecule has 7 carbons (from the formula C7H5ClO2). Let's count the H in each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzene ring with CHO at position 2, OH at position 3, Cl at position 5 (wait, wait, perhaps numbering is different). Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxy, 3-chloro, and aldehyde at position 1. So the structure would be:

Positions:

1: CHO

2: OH

3: Cl

So the ring positions 4,5,6 would have H's.

But wait, let me imagine the ring. Positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). Then, the positions 4 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 3), and position 5 is adjacent to OH (position 2) and Cl (position 3).

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR again.

In option A, the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the benzene ring has CHO at position 2, OH at position 3, Cl at position 5. Wait, maybe that's not the right way to number it. Alternatively, the structure could have the aldehyde group at position 1, the hydroxyl at position 2, and Cl at position 3. So numbering:

1: CHO

2: OH

3: Cl

In that case, the remaining positions (4,5,6) would have H's.

But in any case, the aromatic protons would be in such a way that the NMR shows two doublets of 2H each, and a singlet at 11 ppm for the aldehyde proton.

So the aromatic region would have protons that are split into two doublets. For such a substitution pattern (CHO at 1, Cl at 3, OH at 2), the adjacent H's would be in positions 4,5,6.

But perhaps I'm getting too stuck on this. Let's think about the other data.

The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which could be due to an -OH group. So in option A, there's both an OH and a CHO group. So the IR would show both the O-H stretch (broad) and the C=O stretch of the aldehyde (sharp around 1720).

In the NMR, the 11.0 ppm would be the aldehyde proton (CHO), and the broad peak in IR is from the OH. But why is the OH appearing as a singlet? Well, perhaps in the NMR, the OH is exchanging quickly and might appear as a broad peak, but in the data given, it's a singlet. So that could be an issue.

Wait, but in the NMR data, there's only a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is 1H. Another possibility is that the singlet is an aldehyde proton. So the aldehyde would be the 11 ppm peak. Then, the OH group would be in the structure, but maybe it's not showing up as a separate peak, or it's integrated as part of the aromatic protons. But the NMR shows three distinct signals: 11.0 (1H), 8.02 (2H), 7.72 (2H). That adds up to 5 H. The molecular formula for options A, B, D is C7H5ClO2, which has 5 H (7 carbons, 5 H). So the NMR accounts for all the H's. So the 11.0 ppm must be either the aldehyde proton or the OH.

Wait, but in option B and D, which are benzoic acids, the COOH group would have an OH. So in their NMR, the COOH proton would be a broad peak, possibly not integrated or perhaps a singlet. But if the sample is in D2O or under certain conditions, maybe the -OH is exchanged and doesn't show up. But in the data provided, the 11.0 is a singlet, so it's a proton that's not exchanging. So perhaps that's the aldehyde proton.

So if the 11.0 is an aldehyde, then option A or C. But C has a higher molecular weight, so it's out.

So back to A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

In this structure, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet at 11.0 ppm. The OH is part of the aromatic ring and would appear as a peak in the NMR, but perhaps it's not in the data. Alternatively, maybe the OH is exchanged and not showing up as a peak, but in that case, why is the IR showing a broad O-H peak? Because the OH is present, so the IR would show that. So the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is consistent with an -OH group.

Putting that together, the aldehyde's proton is at 11.0, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets because of the substituents on the ring causing the coupling.

Another point: the molecular ion at m/z 156. Let's compute the exact mass for each option's molecular ion.

Assuming the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

The exact mass can be calculated.

Carbon: 12.01 *7 = 84.07

Hydrogen: 1.008 *5 = 5.04

Cl: 34.97 = approx 34.97

O: 16.00 *2 =32.00

Total: 84.07 +5.04 =89.11 +34.97=124.08 +32.00=156.08.

So the molecular ion is at m/z 156, and the next peak is at 158, which is 2 mass units higher, suggesting Cl isotopic peak.

So the molecular formula matches, so all options A, B, D fit.

But then, the NMR data must help us differentiate.

In option B and D, which are benzoic acids, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. In the NMR, the two doublets suggest a para-disubstituted ring, but for benzoic acid, the substituents are at position 1 (COOH) and another position (either 2 or 4).

Wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the aromatic ring would have substituents in para positions. The H's at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H's at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In that case, the H's at 2 and 6 would be more deshielded (higher ppm) and appear as a doublet. The H's at 3 and 5 would be less deshielded (lower ppm), also as a doublet. So in the NMR, the two doublets would reflect this.

The higher ppm (8.02) would be H-2 and H-6, and the lower (7.72) would be H-3 and H-5.

In that case, how would the coupling look? For a para-substituted benzene, the coupling between adjacent protons is typically around 8 Hz. So each pair would be a doublet with a coupling constant J around 8 Hz.

In the NMR data, each doublet is 2H, which fits this scenario.

So for option B, the COOH is at 1, Cl at 4. So the aromatic H's would split into two doublets as described.

But what about the 11.0 ppm peak? In benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, which might not appear as a singlet. Unless the sample is in a deprotonated form, but then the molecular weight would change.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, which includes the COOH group. If the sample were deprotonated (COO^-), the mass would be 155. But the data shows 156 as the molecular ion, so it's likely that the COOH is protonated. So the H on COOH would be a broad peak. But in the NMR data provided, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet, not a broad peak. So that's a problem for option B.

In option A, the 11.0 ppm is the aldehyde proton, which would be a sharp singlet. The OH would be on the aromatic ring, and would be a phenolic OH, which could appear as a broad peak in the IR. But in the NMR, the OH proton may not appear as a separate peak because it's exchanging, or perhaps it's integrated into the aromatic region as a broad peak. Alternatively, it's not showing up because it's in D2O or something, but the data provided doesn't include a peak for it, which is confusing.

Wait, but in the NMR, the sum of H's is 1+2+2=5. The molecular formula for options A, B, D has 5 H's. So all H's are accounted for. So the 11.0 is the aldehyde, and the OH must be elsewhere. Wait, but the molecular formula includes an OH, which would contribute a proton. Oh wait, the formula for option A is C7H5ClO2: 7 C, 5 H, 1 Cl, 2 O. So yes, 5 H's.

So the 5 H's include the aldehyde (1H), the aromatic H's (4H), and the OH (1H). But wait, 1+4+1=6 H's. Wait, no, that can't be. Because 5 H's in total.

Ah, wait, perhaps the OH is part of the aromatic H's. No, the OH is an -OH group, not an aromatic H.

Hmm, perhaps in option A, the structure is 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. So the aldehyde is at position 1, the OH at position 2, Cl at position 3. Then, the aromatic H's would be at positions 4,5,6.

But wait, that would give three aromatic H's, but the NMR shows four (2+2). So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure in option A is such that the ring has two substituents adjacent to each other, leading to equivalent H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to two sets of two equivalent H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in positions 2 and 4, making the ring have two sets of two equivalent H's.

Wait, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let's try to summarize:

The NMR data shows 5 H's in total, two sets of 2H each as doublets, and a singlet at 11 ppm. The possible structures are A, B, D.

In option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid), the aromatic H's would be two doublets, each for 2H. The 11.0 ppm would need to be the COOH proton, but that would be a broad peak, not a singlet. So unless the sample is deprotonated, which it's not (molecular ion is 156), this doesn't fit.

In option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), the aromatic H's would be in a different pattern. Let's think: COOH at 1, Cl at 2. So the ring has substituents at 1 and 2. The H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

In this case, the H's at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl, so more deshielded (higher ppm), and the H's at 4 and 5 would be more shielded (lower ppm). So the NMR would show a doublet at higher ppm (say, 8.02) for H-3 and H-6, and a doublet at lower ppm (7.72) for H-4 and H-5. That matches the NMR data.

But then, the 11.0 ppm would have to be the COOH proton, which would be a broad peak, not a singlet. So again, it's a problem.

Wait, but option A has an aldehyde and an OH. So the 11.0 is an aldehyde proton. The OH would be in the structure, and its proton would be part of the 5 H's. But earlier, I thought that the structure's aromatic H's would have four H's, but option A has five H's in total, so that would require the aromatic H's to be four.

Wait, perhaps the structure has the aldehyde (CHO) at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3. Then, the ring has H's at positions 4,5,6.

But that would give three aromatic H's, which doesn't match the NMR's four H's.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure. Maybe the substituents are arranged such that two pairs of H's are on the ring, making the NMR show two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 2-chloro-3-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (Cl), 3 (OH). Then, the ring would have H's at positions 4,5,6. But that's only three aromatic H's, which doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 3 (Cl), and 2 (OH). Then, the ring would have H's at positions 4,5,6.

But again, that doesn't give enough aromatic H's.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let's think of the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) – likely aldehyde or OH.

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) – perhaps H's adjacent to an EWG.

7.72 ppm (d, 2H) – perhaps H's adjacent to another EWG.

If the two doublets of 2H each are on the aromatic ring, and are each adjacent to substituents, then perhaps the substituents are at positions that make the adjacent H's split into two doublets.

In this case, perhaps the substituents are in para positions, so each substituent is at 1 and 3 positions? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, making the H's in positions 2,3,5,6. Then, positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to substituent 1) would have one set of doublets, and positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to substituent 4) another set.

Ah, perhaps in option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the H's at 2 and 6 would each be adjacent to substituent 1 (COOH), giving a higher ppm. The H's at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent 4 (Cl), giving a lower ppm. So the NMR would show two doublets, each for 2H. But then, what about the 11.0 ppm?

If the 11.0 is the COOH proton, then the NMR would have a singlet at 11.0, but in benzoic acid, the COOH proton is a broad peak, not a singlet. So that's a problem. Alternatively, if the sample is deprotonated, but then the molecular weight would be 155, which doesn't match the data.

So perhaps option A is correct. Let's think about the structure again.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

So the ring has CHO at position 1, Cl at position 3, OH at position 2.

The aromatic H's would be at positions 4,5,6.

But that's three H's. But the NMR has four H's in the aromatic region (two doublets of 2H each). So that doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps option A isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 2-chloro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, substituents are CHO at 1, Cl at 2, OH at 4. Then, the ring has H's at positions 3,5,6.

But that's three H's again. Not matching the NMR.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of another approach. The 1H NMR has two doublets of 2H each. That suggests that the ring has four H's, which is possible only if the substituents are in such a way that two pairs of equivalent H's exist.

Wait, if the ring has two substituents, each at positions that cause the remaining H's to split into two sets of two equivalent H's each. For example, if substituents are para to each other, each substituent causing two equivalent H's.

So, for example, if substituent X is at position 1 and substituent Y is at position 3. Then, the H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the H's at positions 4 and 5 are equivalent. But that would require the substituents to be in a certain arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are para (positions 1 and 4), making the H's at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 equivalent.

Yes, that's the scenario in option B. So substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Then, the H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and at 3 and 5 are equivalent.

In that case, the NMR would show two doublets, each for 2H. The higher ppm would be from H's adjacent to COOH, and the lower ppm from H's adjacent to Cl.

So, in option B, the NMR would look like:

11.0 ppm (broad, 1H) for COOH (but this doesn't fit the data as it's a singlet).

But the data shows 11.0 as a singlet, which doesn't fit unless it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but if the 11.0 is an aldehyde, then option A or C must be correct. But option C has a higher molecular ion.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure because the NMR doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the 158 peak in the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156, and the next peak is at 158 (32%). So that's the Cl isotope, M+2. So the molecular formula must include Cl.

So, all the options A, B, D have Cl, so that's correct.

The IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. For benzoic acid, that's a bit high. Aldehydes and esters have higher peaks. So perhaps the correct structure has an aldehyde.

So, the IR peak suggests an aldehyde. Then, the 11.0 ppm must be the aldehyde proton.

So, back to option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

In that case, the aldehyde proton is at 11.0 ppm (singlet), and the aromatic H's are in two doublets.

But as I thought earlier, the aromatic H's would have three H's, which doesn't fit the NMR. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the substituent positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ring has four H's. For example, substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. No, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, substituents at positions 1 and 3. Then, the ring would have H's at 2,4,5,6.

Wait, but with substituents at 1 and 3, the H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry, and H's at 4 and 5 are equivalent?

No, perhaps substituents at 1 and 3 would make the H's at 2 and 6 equivalent, but H's at 4 and 5 would not necessarily be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps substituents are at 1 and 4, making the H's at 2 and 6 equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 equivalent.

In that case, substituents at 1 and 4 would be para, which is the case in option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).

So in option B, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the H's at 2 and 6 are each ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In the NMR, each pair would be a doublet. The H's at 2 and 6 would be more deshielded (higher ppm) because they're next to the COOH group, which is a strong EWG. The H's at 3 and 5 would be less deshielded but still next to Cl, which is EWG. So their chemical shifts would be lower.

So, the 8.02 ppm would be H-2 and H-6, each as a doublet. The 7.72 ppm would be H-3 and H-5, each as a doublet.

That fits the NMR data.

But the problem is the 11.0 ppm. In option B, that would have to be the COOH proton. But in the data, it's a singlet, not a broad peak. But if the sample is in D2O, the COOH proton may have exchanged and not show up. Alternatively, the data might not have recorded it, but the integral adds up to 5H, so that must be accounted for.

Wait, but the NMR data shows 5 H's in total. COOH would contribute one H, the aromatic H's four (2+2), and the aldehyde would contribute one H. But in option B, there's no aldehyde.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, option A includes an aldehyde (CHO), so the 11.0 ppm is its proton. The aromatic H's would be at positions 4,5,6, but that's only three H's, so the NMR data must account for four. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps in option A, the substituents are arranged such that two aromatic H's are equivalent, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 2-chloro-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (Cl), and 5 (OH). Then, the ring has H's at positions 3,4,6.

But that's only three H's, which doesn't match the NMR's four.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the NMR.

The aromatic protons are 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. So the substituents are in para positions, each causing the adjacent H's to split into doublets.

In such a case, the substituents would be in positions 1 and 3 (if the ring is numbered that way), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are in para positions, but the ring has more than two substituents. But that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an aldehyde and a Cl, making the ring have two substituents in para positions. For example, substituents at positions 1 (CHO) and 4 (Cl). Then, the ring would have H's at 2,3,5,6.

H-2 and H-6 would be ortho to CHO and meta to Cl. H-3 and H-5 would be meta to CHO and ortho to Cl.

In that case, H-2 and H-6 would be split into a doublet, and H-3 and H-5 into another doublet.

That would fit the NMR data: two doublets of 2H each.

So the molecular structure would be 4-chlorobenzaldehyde. But wait, the options don't include that. The options are 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (A), 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B), phenyl chloroformate (C), and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (D).

Hmm, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So substituents are at 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). Wait, that would make substituents at 1,2,3, which would make the ring have fewer than four aromatic H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-chlorobenzaldehyde. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, but then the 11.0 ppm is the COOH proton, which doesn't fit because the data shows a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is deprotonated, but then the molecular ion would be different.

I think I'm stuck here and need to make a decision.

Based on the NMR data matching the para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the IR indicating an O-H and a carbonyl, and the mass spec showing Cl, the most likely structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B). But the problem is the 11.0 ppm peak, which should be a singlet for the aldehyde, but option B doesn't have an aldehyde.

Alternatively, option A has an aldehyde, which matches the 11.0 ppm, but the aromatic protons don't add up in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic H's in option A are such that there are four H's. Let me imagine the structure again.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). Then, the H's would be at positions 4,5,6.

That's three H's, which doesn't fit the NMR. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the substituents are arranged differently. Maybe the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (Cl), and 5 (OH). Then the ring would have H's at 1,4,6.

But that's three H's again.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 2-chloro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (Cl), 4 (OH). Then, the H's are at 3,5,6.

That's three H's, which again doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the substituents. Let me think of the structure for option A again.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The substituents are CHO at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3.

The ring would have H's at 4,5,6.

So three H's. But the NMR has four H's, which doesn't fit. So either I'm missing something or the structure is different.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H), which is indicative of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So the substituents are in para positions.

So the substituents must be at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Wait, no. Para substituents are 1 and 4. So substituents in 1 and 4. Then, the aromatic H's would be at 2,3,5,6.

Wait, but that's four H's, which matches the NMR. So substituents at 1 and 4. So one substituent is at 1, another at 4.

But in such a case, what would the substituents be?

In option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Then, the H's at 2,3,5,6 are as discussed.

So in that case, the NMR would show two doublets, each for 2H. The 11.0 ppm would be the COOH proton.

But why is the 11.0 a singlet?

Alternatively, perhaps the sample is a sodium salt of benzoic acid, but then the molecular weight would be different.

Hmm. I think I've spent a lot of time on this and need to make a decision. Based on the NMR data, the structure must have an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions, leading to two doublets of 2H each. The 11.0 ppm is a singlet, likely an aldehyde proton, which would point to option A. But the issue is the aromatic H's don't add up. Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct, and the 11.0 is the COOH proton, but that doesn't fit the singlet.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 11.0 ppm is not an aldehyde, but an -OH group. Let me think. Phenolic -OH protons can appear around 10-12 ppm as a singlet, especially if the solution is concentrated or if the proton is exchanging and appears as a sharp peak. So perhaps in option B, the COOH is deprotonated, but that would change the molecular ion.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11.0 ppm is the COOH proton, but it's a singlet. But in reality, COOH protons are broad. So that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let's think about option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Structure: COOH at 1, Cl at 2. So substituents are at 1 and 2.

The aromatic H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

H-3 and H-6 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. H-4 and H-5 are between H-3 and H-5 (if that makes sense). So the H-3 and H-6 would be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm as a doublet. H-4 and H-5 would be in a less deshielded environment, appearing as a doublet at lower ppm.

So the NMR would show 8.02 (d,2H) for H-3 and H-6, and 7.72 (d,2H) for H-4 and H-5. That matches the data.

But what about the 11.0 ppm? It would have to be the COOH proton, which is a broad peak, not a singlet. So unless the sample is deprotonated, which changes the molecular ion, which it isn't, this is a problem.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156, which includes the COOH group. So the sample is protonated, so the COOH is present as -COOH, not -COO^-.

So, the 11.0 ppm cannot be the COOH proton as it's a singlet. Therefore, this doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, despite the NMR inconsistency.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier, and the 11.0 ppm is the aldehyde proton, which would point to option A, even though the aromatic H's don't add up.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO) and 3 (Cl), making the ring have two substituents, leading to four aromatic H's. Let me imagine this structure: 3-chloro-1-phenylpropanal? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-chlorobenzaldehyde. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are limited to the four given. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, despite the 11.0 ppm issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11.0 ppm is not from the COOH but another group. Wait, but option B doesn't have an aldehyde.

Wait, someone else's perspective: the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or aldehyde. The broad peak from 3500-2700 suggests O-H, such as in a carboxylic acid, phenol, or alcohol.

Looking back, option B is a benzoic acid, which has both a COOH and Cl. The IR would show the O-H (broad) from the acid and the C=O (sharp) from the acid, which is around 1700 cm^-1. But the IR here is at 1720, which is higher, more like an ester or aldehyde.

So perhaps the correct structure has an aldehyde group. Hence, option A or C. But C is out because of the mass.

So, option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (from phenol) and C=O (from aldehyde) peaks. The NMR would show the aldehyde proton at 11.0 ppm (singlet), the aromatic H's as two doublets of 2H each, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring in option A has substituents that make two pairs of equivalent H's.

If the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), then the H's at positions 4,5,6 would have a certain symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ring has two doublets. For example, if substituents are in such a way that two H's are equivalent and another two are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (Cl), and 4 (OH). Then, the aromatic H's would be at 3,5,6. But that's three H's, which doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck again. Based on the data, the presence of an aldehyde (from the 11.0 ppm singlet and 1720 IR peak) points to option A. The molecular formula matches, and the NMR aromatic region could fit if the substituents are arranged correctly to create two doublets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the 1H NMR shows two doublets, which suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. This is common in para-disubstituted rings. So the substituents must be para.

In option A, the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), which are adjacent, not para. So that doesn't create a para substituent arrangement.

In option B, substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), which are para. So the aromatic H's would split into two doublets.

But then the 11.0 ppm would have to be the COOH proton, which contradicts the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), which are adjacent. Then, the aromatic H's would be in such a way that two doublets are observed.

But again, the 11.0 ppm doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 11.0 ppm is not the COOH, but an aldehyde. So the structure must have both an aldehyde and a COOH group. But looking at the options, none of them have both.

So, that can't be. So perhaps I'm stuck again.

I think I'll have to go with option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, despite the 11.0 ppm discrepancy. Because the NMR aromatic data fits, and the IR and mass data fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol, and the **m/z = 158** peak indicates the presence of a chlorine atom due to its isotopic contribution. The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, consistent with an O-H group, and a **sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, indicative of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data includes **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**, **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)**, and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
- **Molecular formula**: C₇H₅ClO₂.
- **Molecular weight**: 156 g/mol, matching the molecular ion peak.
- **IR**: The broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the phenolic O-H group, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the aldehyde carbonyl group.
- **¹H NMR**: The **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** corresponds to the aldehyde proton. However, the aromatic protons would be split into specific patterns depending on the substituents. The **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, but the substituents in this compound (CHO, OH, Cl) do not create a para-disubstituted pattern. This makes the NMR data inconsistent with the structure.

#### **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- **Molecular formula**: C₇H₅ClO₂.
- **Molecular weight**: 156 g/mol, matching the molecular ion peak.
- **IR**: The broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H group, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carboxylic acid carbonyl group.
- **¹H NMR**: The **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons of a para-disubstituted benzene ring (COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4). However, the **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** does not fit the expected broad peak for the carboxylic acid proton, which is typically not a sharp singlet. This creates some inconsistency in the data.

#### **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**
- **Molecular formula**: C₈H₇ClO₂.
- **Molecular weight**: 170 g/mol, which is inconsistent with the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**. This option is eliminated.

#### **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- **Molecular formula**: C₇H₅ClO₂.
- **Molecular weight**: 156 g/mol, matching the molecular ion peak.
- **IR**: The broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H group, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carboxylic acid carbonyl group.
- **¹H NMR**: The **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons of a disubstituted benzene ring (COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2). However, the **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** does not fit the expected broad peak for the carboxylic acid proton, similar to Option B. This creates inconsistency in the data.

### Conclusion:
The molecular weight and spectral data (IR and NMR) are most consistent with **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**. While the **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** does not perfectly align with the expected broad peak for the carboxylic acid proton, it is the best match among the given options. 

Answer: B
