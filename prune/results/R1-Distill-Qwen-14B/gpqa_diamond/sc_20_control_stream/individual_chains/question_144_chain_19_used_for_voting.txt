Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. The question is about the mean decay distance of this meson X. Oh wait, mean decay distance—so that's like how far the particle travels before it decays, right?

The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Oh, and the options are all in meters, pretty small numbers.

Wait, I think decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. Like, the longer it lives, the further it can travel before decaying. The formula I remember is something like c times the lifetime, where c is the speed of light. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the particle's width. But wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the lifetime via τ = ħ/(Γ), but wait I'm a bit confused about the exact relation. Let me think.

Oh wait, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). And the mean decay distance L is then c multiplied by τ, because distance is speed multiplied by time. So L = c * τ = c * (ħ / Γ). That makes sense.

But wait, particle physics often uses natural units where ħ = c = 1, but when converting to meters, we need to bring back the actual units. So I'll have to compute it using the actual values of ħ and c.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Multiply by the speed of light c to get the decay length L = c * τ.
3. Convert all the units properly.

Wait, but what about the production energy and mass given? Oh, wait, I think that's a red herring because the decay width is already given. So the production energy might not factor into this particular calculation since the problem gives Γ directly. So maybe I don't need to worry about E_X and m_X for this question. But wait, sometimes particles have energies that affect their lifetime as seen in the lab frame. Oh, right, time dilation! Because particles moving at high speeds (relativistic speeds) experience time differently. So the lifetime we calculate using τ is the proper time, but in the lab frame, it's longer due to gamma factor.

Right, so the decay length isn't just c times τ. It's actually c times gamma times tau, because from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). Because E is the total energy of the particle.

So, putting it together: the mean decay distance L is c * gamma * tau. And gamma is E/(m c²). Let me write that formula:

L = c * (E / (m c²)) * (ħ / Γ)

Simplify that a bit. Because c in numerator and denominator cancels one c. So:

L = (E * ħ) / (m c Γ )

Wait, let me make sure. Gamma is E/(m c²), so substituting into L:

L = c * (E/(m c²)) * (ħ/Γ) = (E ħ) / (m c Γ )

Yes, that looks right.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, but I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's convert everything into SI units.

Given:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² (since for particles, mass is often expressed as E/c²)
Γ_X = 320 MeV

But wait, in SI units, we need to convert GeV to Joules and MeV to Joules.

We know that 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.
1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 8 GeV is 8e9 eV.
Similarly, 320 MeV is 320e6 eV.

So, let's compute each term.

E = 8 GeV = 8e9 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8e9 * 1.60218e-19 J.
Let me calculate that:

8e9 = 8,000,000,000
8e9 * 1.60218e-19 = (8 * 1.60218) * 1e-10 = 12.81744e-10 J? Wait, no, 8e9 * 1e-19 is 8e-10, so 8e9 *1.60218e-19 = 8 *1.60218 * 1e-10 = approximately 12.81744e-10 J. Wait, that's 1.281744e-9 J.

Wait, better to compute it accurately:

E = 8e9 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8e9 *1.60218e-19 = (8 * 1.60218) * 1e9 * 1e-19 = 12.81744 * 1e-10 = 1.281744e-9 J.

Similarly, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². To convert to kg, we need to remember that 1 GeV/c² is approximately 1.7827e-27 kg.

So m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1.2 * 1.7827e-27 kg = 2.13924e-27 kg.

Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 320e6 eV. So:

Γ = 320e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 320 * 1.60218e-13 = 512.6976e-13 J. So that's 5.126976e-11 J.

Wait, let me compute that again.

320e6 eV = 3.2e8 eV. Wait, no, wait 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 *1.60218e-19 J/eV = (320e6) * (1.60218e-19) = 320 * 1.60218e-13 = 512.6976e-13 J → 5.126976e-11 J.

Wait, 320e6 is 3.2e8? No, 320 million is 3.2e8? Wait, no, 320 million is 320,000,000 which is 3.2e8? Wait, 320 million is 320 * 1e6 → 3.2e8. Oh wait, no, 320 million is 320,000,000 → 3.2e8? No, wait 1e6 is a million, so 320 million is 3.2e8? That can't be right. Wait, 1e8 is 100,000,000. So 3.2e8 is 320,000,000. So yes, 320 million is 3.2e8. So 320e6 is 3.2e8.

But wait, 320e6 is 320 * 1e6 = 3.2e8, correct.

So 3.2e8 eV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J/eV → 320e6 = 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = (3.2 * 1.60218) * 1e-11 = 5.126976e-11 J.

Okay, so now, let's plug into the formula:

L = (E * ħ ) / (m c Γ )

Wait, no, earlier I thought the formula is L = (E * ħ ) / ( m c Γ )

Wait, let me recap. The formula is L = (E * ħ ) / ( m c Γ )

Wait, but let me make sure about the units. Because I'm going to plug everything in SI units, so let's see:

E is in Joules, m in kg, Γ in J (since it's the decay width, which has units of energy), and ħ is in J·s, and c is in m/s.

So, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: E * ħ

E = 1.281744e-9 J
ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So E * ħ = 1.281744e-9 * 1.0545718e-34 ≈ (1.281744 * 1.0545718) * 1e-43 ≈ approximately 1.353e-43 J²·s?

Wait, not sure, but moving on.

Denominator: m c Γ

m = 2.13924e-27 kg
c = 3e8 m/s
Γ = 5.126976e-11 J

So m c Γ = 2.13924e-27 kg * 3e8 m/s * 5.126976e-11 J

Wait, let's compute each part:

2.13924e-27 kg * 3e8 m/s = 6.41772e-19 kg·m/s

Then multiply by Γ (5.126976e-11 J). So 6.41772e-19 * 5.126976e-11 = ?

Let me compute 6.41772e-19 *5.126976e-11:

Multiply 6.41772 *5.126976 ≈ let's see. 6 *5=30. 0.41772 *5≈2.0886. 6 *0.126976≈0.761856. 0.41772 *0.126976≈0.053.

So approximates to around 30 + 2.0886 + 0.761856 + 0.053 ≈ 32.903? But I should compute accurately.

Alternatively, 6.41772 *5.126976.

Let me compute:

5 *6.41772 =32.0886

0.126976 *6.41772 ≈ 0.126976 *6=0.761856, 0.126976 *0.41772≈0.05306. So total ≈ 0.761856 +0.05306=0.814916.

So total is 32.0886 +0.814916≈32.9035.

So 32.9035e-30 (since 1e-19 *1e-11 =1e-30).

So denominator is 3.29035e-29 kg·m²/s².

Wait, because J is kg·m²/s².

So numerator: 1.353e-43 J²·s.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J² is kg²·m^4/s^4. Hmm, but I'm more concerned about the exponents.

So numerator is E * ħ = (J) * (J·s) )= J²·s.

Denominator is (kg·m/s) * J → kg·m/s * kg·m²/s² → kg²·m³/s³.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too detailed, but perhaps I should just compute the values.

So L = (1.353e-43 J²·s) / (3.29035e-29 kg m³/s³ )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Maybe it's easier to just compute the numerical value and the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

So L = (E * ħ) / (m c Γ )

Plug in numbers:

E = 1.281744e-9 J

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s

m = 2.13924e-27 kg

c= 3e8 m/s

Γ=5.126976e-11 J

So,

Numerator: 1.281744e-9 * 1.0545718e-34 = (1.281744 * 1.0545718 ) * 1e-43 ≈ 1.353 * 1e-43 = 1.353e-43

Denominator: 2.13924e-27 *3e8 *5.126976e-11

Compute each step:

First, 2.13924e-27 *3e8 = 6.41772e-19

Then, 6.41772e-19 *5.126976e-11 = 3.29035e-29

So denominator is 3.29035e-29.

So L = (1.353e-43) / (3.29035e-29) ) → 1.353 /3.29035 ≈ 0.4107, and exponents: 1e-43 /1e-29 =1e-14.

So L ≈ 0.4107e-14 m → which is 4.107e-15 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, so my initial calculation gives around 4.1e-15 m, which is close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E * ħ.

Let me compute E * ħ again. E is 8 GeV, which is 8e9 eV. Each eV is 1.60218e-19 J.

So E = 8e9 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8e9 *1.60218e-19 = (8 *1.60218) * 1e-10 = 12.81744e-10 J → 1.281744e-9 J. That's correct.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So E * ħ is 1.281744e-9 * 1.0545718e-34.

1.281744e-9 * 1.0545718e-34 = 1.281744 *1.0545718 * 1e-43.

Let me compute 1.281744 *1.0545718: let's compute 1.281744 *1.05.

1.281744 *1 =1.281744

1.281744 *0.05=0.0640872

Total ≈1.345831. But wait, 1.0545718 is approximately 1.05457. So 1.281744 *1.05457.

Let me compute 1.281744 *1 =1.281744

1.281744 *0.05 =0.0640872

1.281744 *0.00457 ≈ let me compute 1.281744 *0.004 =0.005126976, 1.281744 *0.00057≈0.000730866 → total≈0.005857842.

Adding everything: 1.281744 +0.0640872=1.3458312 +0.005857842≈1.351689.

So E * ħ ≈1.351689e-43.

Denominator: m c Γ.

m=1.2 GeV/c² =1.2 * 1.7827e-27 kg=2.13924e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

Γ=320 MeV=320e6 eV *1.60218e-19 J/eV=5.126976e-11 J.

So m c Γ = 2.13924e-27 *3e8 *5.126976e-11.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 2.13924e-27 *3e8 = 6.41772e-19.

Then, 6.41772e-19 *5.126976e-11 = ?

Compute 6.41772e-19 *5.126976e-11.

Multiply 6.41772 *5.126976 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

Compute 6 *5=30.

6 *0.126976≈0.761856.

0.41772 *5=2.0886.

0.41772 *0.126976≈approx 0.05306.

So adding these up: 30 +0.761856=30.761856 + 2.0886=32.850456 +0.05306≈32.9035.

So 6.41772 *5.126976 ≈32.9035.

Now, the exponents: 1e-19 *1e-11=1e-30.

So m c Γ =32.9035e-30 → 3.29035e-29.

So now, L = (1.351689e-43) / (3.29035e-29) ) = (1.351689 /3.29035) ) * 1e-14.

Compute 1.351689 /3.29035 ≈ 0.4107.

So L ≈ 0.4107e-14 m → 4.107e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the formula.

Alternative approach: since the decay width Γ is given, the mean lifetime τ is ħ/(Γ). And the decay length is c * gamma * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, E/(m c^2).

So L = c * (E/(m c^2)) * (ħ/Γ )

Simplify that:

L = (c E ħ ) / ( m c^2 Γ )

The c in numerator and denominator cancels one c, so:

L = (E ħ) / (m c Γ )

Which is the same formula as before. So I think I didn't make any mistake in the formula.

Hmm, so why is the calculated value about 4.1e-15, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close, maybe due to more precise constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me recompute using more precise values.

Constants:

Planck constant ħ = 1.054571817e-34 J·s (exact value as per SI).

Speed of light c = 299792458 m/s (exact value).

Electron charge e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So, using these accurate values.

Compute E: 8 GeV = 8e9 eV → 8e9 *1.602176634e-19 J = 8e9 *1.602176634e-19 = (8 *1.602176634) * 1e-10 → 12.817413072e-10 J → 1.2817413072e-9 J.

m = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1.2 * (1.7827e-27 kg) → let me compute 1 GeV/c² exact value.

Wait, 1 GeV/c² is (1e9 eV) / (c²). Since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so 1 GeV =1.602176634e-10 J.

So energy E = mc² → m = E/(c²) in kg.

Thus, m_X = (1.2 GeV) / (c²) = 1.2e9 eV / ( (3e8 m/s)^2 )

But wait, let's compute m_X accurately.

m_X = (1.2e9 eV) / (c²) * (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) / ( (m/s)^2 )

Wait, perhaps better to use the conversion factor.

1 GeV/c² = 1.7827e-27 kg (exact value is 1.782769029e-27 kg).

So m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1.2 * 1.782769029e-27 kg = 2.139322835e-27 kg.

Γ = 320 MeV =320e6 eV → 320e6 *1.602176634e-19 J = 320e6 *1.602176634e-19 → 320e6 =3.2e8, so 3.2e8 *1.602176634e-19 =5.1269652288e-11 J.

Now, compute numerator: E * ħ.

E =1.2817413072e-9 J.

ħ =1.054571817e-34 J·s.

So E * ħ =1.2817413072e-9 *1.054571817e-34 = let's compute this accurately.

1.2817413072e-9 * 1.054571817e-34 = (1.2817413072 * 1.054571817) * 1e-43.

Calculate 1.2817413072 *1.054571817.

Compute 1.2817413072 *1.054571817.

Let me compute:

1.2817413 * 1.0545718.

= (1 *1.0545718) + (0.2817413 *1.0545718)

=1.0545718 + 0.2968706 ≈1.3514424.

So E * ħ ≈1.3514424e-43 J·s.

Denominator: m c Γ.

m =2.139322835e-27 kg.

c=299792458 m/s.

Γ=5.1269652288e-11 J.

Compute m c Γ.

First, m * c =2.139322835e-27 kg *299792458 m/s = ?

2.139322835e-27 *2.99792458e8 = multiply 2.139322835 *2.99792458 ≈ let's compute that.

Approximate 2.1393 *3=6.4179, but more accurately:

2.139322835 *2.99792458 → let's compute.

2 *2.99792458=5.99584916; 0.139322835 *2.99792458≈0.4177.

So total ≈5.99584916 +0.4177 ≈6.4135.

So m * c ≈6.4135e-19 kg·m/s.

Then multiply by Γ: 6.4135e-19 kg·m/s *5.1269652288e-11 J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so kg·m/s * kg·m²/s² = kg²·m³/s^3.

But perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Compute 6.4135e-19 *5.1269652288e-11.

6.4135 *5.1269652288 ≈ let's compute.

6 *5=30; 6 *0.126965≈0.76179; 0.4135 *5=2.0675; 0.4135 *0.126965≈0.0525.

Adding up:30 +0.76179=30.76179 +2.0675=32.82929 +0.0525≈32.88179.

So 6.4135 *5.1269652288 ≈32.88179.

Exponents: 1e-19 *1e-11=1e-30.

So denominator is 32.88179e-30 → 3.288179e-29.

Now, L = numerator / denominator = (1.3514424e-43) / (3.288179e-29) )

= (1.3514424 /3.288179 ) * 1e-14.

Compute 1.3514424 /3.288179.

1.35 /3.288 ≈0.4107.

But let me compute more accurately.

3.288179 * 0.41 =1.34815.

Which is very close to 1.3514424.

So 0.41 *3.288179=1.34815. The numerator is 1.3514424, which is 1.3514424 -1.34815=0.0032924 higher.

So 0.0032924 /3.288179 ≈0.001001.

So total is approximately 0.4101.

So L ≈0.4101e-14 m →4.101e-15 m.

Which is about 4.101e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, option C is5.0223e-15.

Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Lorentz factor.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). Let me compute that to check.

E =8 GeV.

m c² =1.2 GeV.

So gamma =8 GeV /1.2 GeV =8/1.2=6.6666667.

Wait, that's a big factor.

So gamma is 6.6666667.

So, the lifetime τ is ħ/Γ.

So, τ= ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1269652288e-11 J) →1.0545718e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = approx 2.057e-24 seconds.

Then, the proper lifetime τ is 2.057e-24 s.

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau, so 6.6666667 *2.057e-24 s ≈1.371e-23 s.

Then, the decay length is c * lifetime.

So L = c * gamma * tau = c * (E/(m c²)) * (ħ/Γ )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it this way to see where the difference is.

Compute c * gamma * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma=6.6666667.

tau= ħ / Γ =1.0545718e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = approx 2.057e-24 s.

So, c * gamma * tau =3e8 *6.6666667 *2.057e-24.

Compute 3e8 *6.6666667 =2e9.

Wait, 3e8 *6.6666667 = (3 *6.6666667) *1e8 =20 *1e8 =2e9.

Then, 2e9 *2.057e-24 =4.114e-15 m.

So that brings us back to L≈4.114e-15 m.

Hmm, which is closer to option B (4.0655e-15), but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ and c.

Let me recompute with precise numbers.

Compute tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ =1.054571817e-34 J·s.

Γ=5.1269652288e-11 J.

Tau=1.054571817e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = let's compute.

1.054571817e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = (1.054571817 /5.1269652288 )e-23.

Compute 1.054571817 /5.1269652288.

Approximately, 5.126965 is about 5.127. 1.05457 is about 1.0546.

1.0546 /5.127 ≈ 0.2057.

So tau≈0.2057e-23 s →2.057e-24 s.

Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV =6.6666666667.

So lab tau =6.6666666667 *2.057e-24 s ≈1.371e-23 s.

Then L =c * tau_lab =3e8 m/s *1.371e-23 s =3e8 *1.371e-23 =4.113e-15 m.

Hmm, same result.

But the options are A:5.0223e-16, B:4.0655e-15, C:5.0223e-15, D:4.0655e-16.

Hmm, my calculation is about 4.113e-15. None of the options are exactly that, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is close.

But perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). The E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 /1.2 =6.666..., correct.

Hmm.

Wait another thought: sometimes when dealing with units, people use natural units where ħ = c =1. So perhaps in that case, the mean decay length is computed differently. Let me think.

In natural units, 1 GeV^{-1} is about 6.582e-25 seconds (since ħ c ≈197 MeV fm, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps using natural units, the decay length is (E * tau) where tau is in natural units.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try another approach.

Alternative approach using natural units.

In natural units, ħ = c =1. So the decay width Γ has units of energy. The mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ → τ = 1 / Γ, but in units where ħ=1.

The decay length is then L = v * τ, where v is the particle's velocity. For relativistic particles, v ≈c, so L≈ c * gamma * tau.

But in natural units, c=1, so L ≈ gamma * tau.

But how to compute it.

Wait, maybe the formula in natural units is L = (E * tau) / m.

Because in natural units, E = gamma m c^2 → gamma = E/(m c^2), and tau = ħ/(Gamma). So L = c * gamma * tau = c * (E/(m c^2)) * ( ħ / Gamma )

Which again brings me back to the same formula as before.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

L = (E * ħ c) / (m Gamma )

Wait, because I'm getting the same result.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact L using precise numbers, maybe the difference is due to the precise value of c.

Wait, let me recompute with more precise c.

c=299792458 m/s.

Compute m c =2.139322835e-27 kg *299792458 m/s.

Let me compute 2.139322835e-27 *299792458.

So 2.139322835e-27 *2.99792458e8 = 2.139322835 *2.99792458e-19.

2.139322835 *2.99792458 ≈6.4135.

So 6.4135e-19 kg·m/s.

Now, multiply by Γ=5.1269652288e-11 J.

So 6.4135e-19 *5.1269652288e-11.

6.4135 *5.1269652288 ≈32.8818.

So 32.8818e-30 →3.28818e-29.

Numerator E * ħ: 1.2817413072e-9 *1.054571817e-34 =1.3514424e-43.

So L =1.3514424e-43 /3.28818e-29 = (1.3514424 /3.28818) ) *1e-14.

1.3514424 /3.28818 =0.4107.

So L=4.107e-15 m. So again, same result.

So why is option B 4.0655e-15? There must be a miscalculation somewhere, or perhaps I've missed a step.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the total decay width as the uncertainty in energy, and then compute the lifetime, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I should use the natural line width formula, which is gamma = ħ * (width in energy) → but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E or m.

Wait, let me recompute E and m.

E =8 GeV =8e9 eV *1.602176634e-19 J/eV =8e9 *1.602176634e-19 J = (8 *1.602176634) *1e-10 J.

8 *1.602176634 =12.817413072.

So E=12.817413072e-10 J →1.2817413072e-9 J.

m=1.2 GeV/c² =1.2 *1.782769029e-27 kg =2.139322835e-27 kg.

Γ=320 MeV =320e6 eV *1.602176634e-19 J/eV =5.1269652288e-11 J.

Hmm, all correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the division: 1.3514424e-43 / 3.28818e-29.

Let me compute 1.3514424e-43 /3.28818e-29 = (1.3514424 /3.28818 ) * 1e-14.

Compute 1.3514424 /3.28818.

3.28818 *0.41 =1.3481538.

Which is just a little under 1.3514424.

The difference is 1.3514424 -1.3481538 =0.0032886.

So 0.0032886 /3.28818 ≈0.001000.

So total is 0.41 +0.001 =0.411.

So 0.411 *1e-14 =4.11e-15 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that the production energy is 8 GeV. But wait, when a particle is produced, its energy could be higher than its rest mass. So perhaps I should compute gamma as E_rest / m, but wait, no, gamma is E / (m c²), which I did correctly.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation L = (E * c * tau ) / (m).

Wait, let me think.

tau= ħ/(Gamma).

L = gamma * c * tau = (E/(m c^2)) * c * (ħ / Gamma) ) = (E * c * ħ )/(m c^2 Gamma) ) = (E ħ)/(m c Gamma ), which is the same formula.

So I think the calculation is correct, and the answer should be around 4.1e-15 m.

But none of the options is exactly this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the exponents.

In the denominator, m c Gamma =3.28818e-29.

Numerator E* ħ =1.3514424e-43.

So 1.3514424e-43 /3.28818e-29 = (1.3514424 /3.28818 ) * 1e-14.

Which is 0.4107 *1e-14 =4.107e-15 m.

Ah, okay, but the options have option B as 4.0655e-15.

Hmm. Maybe I should check the precise calculation of 1.3514424 /3.28818.

Let me compute 1.3514424 ÷3.28818.

Well, 3.28818 × 0.41 = 1.3481538.

3.28818 ×0.411= 3.28818 *0.41=1.3481538, plus 3.28818*0.001=0.00328818 → total 1.35144198.

So 3.28818 * 0.411 ≈1.351442, which is exactly our numerator.

So 1.3514424 /3.28818 ≈0.411.

Ah, so the result is 0.411e-14 →4.11e-15 m.

Hmm, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute m c Gamma.

m=2.139322835e-27 kg.

c=299792458 m/s.

Gamma=5.1269652288e-11 J.

Compute m c Gamma:

m * c =2.139322835e-27 *299792458 = ?

Let me compute 2.139322835e-27 *2.99792458e8 =2.139322835 *2.99792458e-19.

2.139322835 *2.99792458 ≈6.4135.

So 6.4135e-19 kg·m/s.

Multiply by Gamma=5.1269652288e-11 J.

6.4135e-19 *5.1269652288e-11 →6.4135 *5.1269652288 ≈32.8818.

So 32.8818e-30 →3.28818e-29.

So denominator is still 3.28818e-29.

So the calculation is correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for the decay length is L = gamma * c * tau.

Gamma is E/(m c²).

Tau is ħ / Gamma.

So L = (E/(m c²)) * c * (ħ / Gamma) ) = E c ħ / (m c² Gamma ) )= E ħ / (m c Gamma ), same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (E * c * tau ) / (m).

Wait, but no, that would be the same.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 4.1e-15 m, but the closest option is B:4.0655e-15.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of E was incorrect.

Wait, 8 GeV is 8e9 eV, correct. 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J, so 8e9 eV =8e9 *1.602176634e-19 J =1.2817413072e-9 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the formula L = (E * c * tau ) / (m).

Tau is ħ / Gamma.

So L = (E * c * ħ ) / (m Gamma )

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the speed of the particle.

Wait, beta is v/c. For a relativistic particle, beta ≈1. But the exact expression is beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ).

So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2)=6.6666667.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.

So v=beta c=0.9887 *3e8 m/s≈2.966e8 m/s.

Then, the lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau = gamma * ħ / Gamma.

So L = v * gamma tau = v * (gamma ħ / Gamma).

Which is same as v * ħ gamma / Gamma.

Which is same as (v ħ gamma ) / Gamma.

But v = beta c, so:

L = ( beta c ħ gamma ) / Gamma.

Gamma here is the decay width.

But gamma (Lorentz factor) is E/(m c²) =6.666667.

So putting in the numbers:

beta=0.9887,

c=3e8 m/s,

ħ=1.0545718e-34,

Gamma=5.126965e-11 J.

So,

L = (0.9887 *3e8 *1.0545718e-34 *6.666667 ) /5.126965e-11.

Compute numerator:

0.9887 *3e8 =2.966e8.

2.966e8 *1.0545718e-34 =3.123e-26.

3.123e-26 *6.666667 ≈2.082e-25.

Denominator:5.126965e-11.

So L=2.082e-25 /5.126965e-11 ≈4.06e-15 m.

Ah! Now, that's 4.06e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m).

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I neglected to use the exact value of beta, which is less than 1. So the previous approach without considering beta gives an overestimation because it assumes v=c, but actually v is slightly less than c. So including beta brings the result closer to the option B.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \frac{E \cdot \hbar}{m \cdot c \cdot \Gamma}
\]

where:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the production energy,
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the mass of the meson,
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \) is the decay width,
- \( \hbar = 1.054571817 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( c = 299792458 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Convert units to SI
1. **Energy \( E \):**
   \[
   E = 8 \, \text{GeV} = 8 \times 10^9 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 1.2817413072 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Mass \( m \):**
   \[
   m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 = 1.2 \times 1.782769029 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 2.139322835 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Decay width \( \Gamma \):**
   \[
   \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 5.1269652288 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Step 2: Compute the numerator and denominator
1. **Numerator \( E \cdot \hbar \):**
   \[
   E \cdot \hbar = (1.2817413072 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot (1.054571817 \times 10^{-34}) = 1.3514424 \times 10^{-43} \, \text{J·s}.
   \]

2. **Denominator \( m \cdot c \cdot \Gamma \):**
   - First, compute \( m \cdot c \):
     \[
     m \cdot c = (2.139322835 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2.99792458 \times 10^8) = 6.4135 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \( \Gamma \):
     \[
     m \cdot c \cdot \Gamma = (6.4135 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (5.1269652288 \times 10^{-11}) = 3.28818 \times 10^{-29}.
     \]

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
\[
L = \frac{1.3514424 \times 10^{-43}}{3.28818 \times 10^{-29}} = (1.3514424 / 3.28818) \times 10^{-14}.
\]

1. Divide \( 1.3514424 \) by \( 3.28818 \):
   \[
   1.3514424 / 3.28818 \approx 0.4107.
   \]

2. Multiply by \( 10^{-14} \):
   \[
   L \approx 0.4107 \times 10^{-14} = 4.107 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

### Step 4: Refine using exact velocity factor \( \beta \)
The exact velocity factor \( \beta = v/c \) is:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Including \( \beta \), the decay length becomes:
\[
L = \beta \cdot \frac{E \cdot \hbar}{m \cdot c \cdot \Gamma}.
\]

Substitute \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 4.107 \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

**Answer: B**
