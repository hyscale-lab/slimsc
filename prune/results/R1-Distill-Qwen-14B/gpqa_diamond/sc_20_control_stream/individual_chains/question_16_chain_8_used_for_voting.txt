Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. But wait, are there other possibilities? Oh yeah, sometimes you can have compounds that aren't chiral but still show optical activity because of some kind of internal asymmetry or maybe something else. But I think the main case is the presence of chiral centers.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So if it's 1-chloro, Cl is on C1. And the substituents on the double bond? The double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl attached to the double bond. So maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 2-methylbut-1-ene, I think. Let me draw this. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So:

C1 (Cl attached) is attached to C2, which is attached to a methyl group. So the molecule is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but is that possible? Because but-1-ene is four carbons, double bond starting at C1. So structure is CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 but with double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 → but that's without the double bond. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the double bond. For but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon: Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it would be CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, no, wait. The correct structure is Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether this compound has a chiral center. So, the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's imagine the structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, and perhaps two other substituents. So the substituents on C1 and C2 would be Cl, a CH2 group, and a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So for but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the rest is CH2. Hmm, but in any case, the point is to see if any chiral centers are present.

Now, in this case, since the molecule has a double bond, could that lead to any E or Z isomerism? But the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality. So for the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: does it have any chiral centers? Let's see.

Looking at C1, which is attached to Cl, a double bond (so two substituents), and maybe another CH2 group. Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 has substituents: Cl, a CH2 group (from the double bond), and another CH something. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for any stereogenic centers. Alternatively, maybe I should consider if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, another approach: if a molecule is planar or has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So for (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's think. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two other substituents (maybe CH2 and another group), and C2 has a methyl. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the substituents on C1 and C2 are maybe the same on each side, making it not chiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetric, then it wouldn't be chiral. But wait, in the case of (Z)-configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are same on each carbon. So if on the C1, we have Cl and (say) two CH2 groups, and on C2, we have CH(CH3) and another CH2 group, but maybe they mirror each other. So perhaps the molecule is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Next compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think this is a more complex structure. Let me try to break this down.

Hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: So it's a bicyclic compound. Methano suggests a bridge, perhaps between carbons 4 and 7. The bicyclic system would have a furan ring connected in a way. I'm not exactly visualizing this, but perhaps it's not necessary. The key here is the substituents and whether there's a chiral center.

The substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which is a -CH2Cl group attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified as (3aR,7aS,E), so that suggests that there are stereogenic centers at 3a and 7a, and an E configuration in the double bond.

Wait, but if the molecule has two stereogenic centers (3a and 7a), then it's chiral. So that would mean the molecule is optically active. Because each stereogenic center contributes to the asymmetry.

So this compound should exhibit optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So positions 2 and 3 have methyl groups. The stereocenters are at C2 and C3, with R and S configurations, respectively.

Wait, but wait, in this structure, each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) have CH(CH3) groups attached. Let me think about the substituents on each. For C2 (R configuration):

Groups attached to C2: two CH(CH3), a COOH group, and another carbon. Wait, no, wait. Let's think: the four substituents on each carbon.

Succinic acid is diacid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So adding a methyl on C2 and C3. So C2 has: COOH (from the left), CH(CH3), another CH(CH3), and the central CH2 (but wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the inner carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups attached? Wait, no, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups attached? Or each has one methyl?

Wait, no. 2,3-dimethyl means each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So for C2: substituents are COOH, a methyl, and two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. So each CH2 is C2 and C3. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 and C3 each have a methyl substituent.

So for C2: the groups are COOH (on one side), a methyl group, a CH(CH3) (on the next carbon), and another H? Wait no, wait:

Wait, for HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, the structure is:

O
||O
CH2-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-CH2
But wait, actually, it's:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the CH(CH3) groups is on C2 and C3. So for C2, what are the four substituents? They are:

- One COOH group (from the left)
- A CH(CH3) group (the next carbon)
- A methyl group attached to C2
- And another H? Or is the other group a CH2 or something else?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: the molecule is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no. Each has a methyl, and the rest are connected to the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- One carboxylic acid group (from the left)
- A methyl group (–CH3)
- A single bond to C3 (which is also CH(CH3))
- And another group. Hmm, wait, maybe the carbonyl groups. Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, so each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups, but that can't be right because each can only have four substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it out. The structure is:

O
||
O–C–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–C–O
|| 
O 

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group, and are connected to the adjacent carbons.

Wait, so for C2, the substituents are:

- a carboxylic acid group (from the left)
- a methyl group (–CH3)
- a CH(CH3) on the right (C3)
- and another H?

Wait, no, that can't be, because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps it's:

C2 has:

- a carboxylic acid group (OOC–)
- two CH3 groups (from being 2,3-dimethyl)
- and the adjacent C3.

Wait, no, that's not possible because that would give four substituents. So C2 would have:

- OOC– (from the left)
- CH(CH3) (from the right)
- two CH3 groups (one from 2-methyl, another from 3-methyl?)

Wait, no, that would be two methyl groups attached to C2, which would make it a quaternary center. But that's not possible because in the formula, each of C2 and C3 has only one methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try again. The molecule is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is:

HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. So for C2, the four substituents are:

1. HOOC– group (left)
2. CH(CH3) group (right)
3. a methyl group (from the 2-methyl)
4. what else? Oh, wait, maybe an H.

Hmm, but that would mean C2 is CH(CH3) with an H. So the four substituents would be:

- HOOC– (left)
- CH(CH3) (right)
- CH3 (from 2-methyl)
- H (as the fourth substituent).

Wait, but that would make C2 a chiral center because all four substituents are different. Similarly, C3 would have:

- CH(CH3) (left)
- COOH (right)
- CH3 (3-methyl)
- H.

So both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. So the molecule has two chiral centers, making it a chiral molecule. So it should exhibit optical activity.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. If both C2 and C3 have four different substituents, then they are both chiral centers. So (2R,3S) configuration would make the molecule chiral, leading to optical activity.

So this compound should be optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same structure as the third compound but with both R configurations on C2 and C3.

Wait, but does that matter? If the molecule has two chiral centers, their configuration (R,R) may lead to a meso compound. Because if the molecule is symmetric in some way, it could be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, in the case of tartaric acid, for example, the (R,R) configuration is the meso form, which is achiral. So perhaps this is the same scenario.

So for this compound, are the two chiral centers in such a way that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry?

Looking at the structure:

HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH.

If both C2 and C3 have R configuration, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For instance, imagine a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3; if each has the same configuration and the substituents mirror each other, then the molecule would be achiral.

So in this case, the (2R,3R) configuration might lead to a meso compound, which is not optically active.

So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (the third and fourth carbons), and the hydroxyl is on C1.

So the structure is cyclohexene with substituents at C1 (OH) and double bond at C3-4.

Now, does this compound have a chiral center? The hydroxyl is on C1. Let me imagine the substituents on C1.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the C1 would have the hydroxyl group, a cyclohexene ring (so two adjacent carbons), and another substituent. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, so C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- C2 (which is part of the ring)
- C6 (also part of the ring)
- and a hydrogen or another substituent.

Wait, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring and two substituents. So C1 in cyclohexene would have:

- OH
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C6 and C2)
- And another substituent. Wait, but in the ring structure, each carbon is bonded to two ring carbons and two other groups. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the substituents on C1 are OH, and the other substituent is probably a hydrogen. So the four substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (ring)
- C6 (ring)
- H

So are all four substituents different? Yes:

- OH is unique
- C2 is part of the ring, but not a substituent like a methyl or something else. So if C2 is part of the ring, then C1 is attached to two other ring carbons, which are different from each other and from the substituents. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on the adjacent carbons may vary based on the double bond.

Wait, but in this case, C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So for C1, substituents are:

1. OH
2. C2 (which is CH2 connected to the ring)
3. C6 (which is CH2 connected to the ring)
4. H

Wait, but C2 and C6 are both part of the ring, but are they attached to the same groups? If the ring is asymmetric, then C2 and C6 may have different substituents. But in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the substituents on C2 and C6 may be similar (each has two CH2 groups attached).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether C1 is a chiral center.

If C1 is attached to four distinct groups, then it's a chiral center. The groups are:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) which are part of the ring, but each is connected to different parts of the ring, which may make them different substituents.
- H

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are each connected to the same kinds of substituents, then perhaps they are not different. For example, if both C2 and C6 are each attached to two CH2 groups, then they would be the same as substituents from C1's perspective. In that case, C1 would have substituents: OH, two identical CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and H. So that would make three substituents, but wait, no, because each CH2 is a different group in the ring, but perhaps they are the same from C1's perspective.

Alternatively, perhaps C1 is attached to two different ring carbons (C2 and C6), each of which is connected to different parts of the ring. So from C1's perspective, C2 and C6 are different substituents. So substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (which is connected to the rest of the ring in a certain way)
- C6 (which is connected differently)
- H

If that's the case, then all four substituents are different, making C1 a chiral center. So that would mean the compound is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

Wait, but the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the configuration is R, which implies a chiral center. So yes, this compound would be optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three are s configuration.

Wait, let me think: cyclohexane has six carbons. The substituents are at positions 1,3,5—all s. So the molecule is a triol, with OH groups on alternate carbons.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If so, then it could be achiral despite having multiple stereocenters.

Looking at the arrangement of OH groups: 1,3,5. If all are s, then maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a chair conformation where each OH is axial or equatorial, and the arrangement is symmetrical.

Wait, let's imagine the chair: if each OH is axial, pointing in the same direction (say, all down), then perhaps the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, but if all three substituents are in s configuration, then the arrangement might not be symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, thus achiral.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has all three OH groups in a symmetrical pattern, like arranged in a trigonal manner, perhaps it's not chiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane or axis, then it's achiral.

But in this case, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions, which are every other carbon. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry bisecting the ring, making it achiral. Let me think: imagine a plane cutting through the ring between C2 and C6, for example. If the substituents are symmetrically placed on either side of that plane, then the molecule would be achiral.

So, if all three OH groups are in s configuration, and the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound and not chiral, thus not optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents isn't symmetric. But I'm not entirely sure. I think in this case, the molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. So it does not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, the molecule has three stereocenters, each with s configuration. Let me think about whether their arrangement leads to an overall achiral structure. For example, in a molecule where all substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Like, for example, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all R configurations might be a meso compound if the substituents are symmetrically placed. So in this case, the triol with OH groups at 1,3,5 could be a meso compound, making it achiral.

So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the first carbon of butanone, and a methyl on the third carbon.

Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the structure would be:

cyclopentyl–CH2–CH2–CH(CH3)–CO.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3–CO. So 1-cyclopentyl would be substituting at the first carbon: cyclopentyl–CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–? Wait, no, wait. Butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But wait, no: butan-1-one is (R)–C(=O)–CH2–CH2–CH2–. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The carbonyl is at position 1, so:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But wait, butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

So the structure is (CH2)3–CO.

So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

CO–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Butan-1-one has the carbonyl at the end:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl?

Not sure, but perhaps the key is whether it has any chiral centers.

Looking for any carbon attached to four different groups.

In the structure, the carbonyl is on C1. Then, the substituents on C1 are the carbonyl group, cyclopentyl, and two other substituents. Wait, maybe C3 has a methyl group. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH(CH3)–cyclopentyl.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl.

Wait, but regardless, perhaps the key is to look for any chiral centers.

So looking at each carbon:

C1: carbonyl group (not a chiral center because it's double-bonded to O).

C2: attached to CO, CH(CH3), and two other substituents. Wait, or maybe:

In butan-1-one, C1 is the carbonyl. So the structure would be:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

So 1-cyclopentyl would replace the CH3 group on C4 with cyclopentyl? No, because butan-1-one is four carbons, with the carbonyl on C1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)–.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituents.

The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So substituents:

At C1: CO group.

At C2: CH2.

At C3: CH(CH3).

At C4: cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, maybe:

Butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–CH2–CH2–CH2–something.

So 1-cyclopentyl would be attached to the carbonyl carbon. So:

CO– (cyclopentyl) – CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But also, there's a 3-methyl group. So on C3, a methyl is attached.

So the structure would be:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

Wait, regardless, the key is to find any chiral centers.

Looking at C3: in this structure, is C3 attached to four different groups? Let's see.

C3 would have:

- CO–cyclopentyl–CH2– (from one side)
- CH(CH3) (from the other)
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl.

Wait, in that case, C2 is attached to CO, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. So substituents: CO, CH(CH3), CH2– (connected to C3), and another CH2– (from C1). So maybe C2 isn't a chiral center.

C3 in this structure would be attached to:

- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH2– (from C4, which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- Two CH2 groups? Or perhaps other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CO–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

So the carbonyl is on C1, attached to cyclopentyl and CH2. Then C2 is CH2 (from CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–), C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2 connected to cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but perhaps the key point is that none of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is attached to four different groups.

Wait, perhaps C3 is attached to:

- a methyl group
- a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl (C1)
- a CH2 group leading to C4 (which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different substituents, making C3 a chiral center. So if that's the case, the molecule would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical activity.

But I'm not entirely confident about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that C3 isn't a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active.

Wait, maybe I should look for any symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it wouldn't be chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is bulky, but that doesn't affect chirality.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at C3, making it optically active.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this one. Let me tentatively say that this compound has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical activity.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers because the substituents on a certain carbon are the same. For instance, if C3 has two CH2 groups attached, then it would have two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, then C3 would have:

- CH(CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one from C2, one to C4)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make four substituents: CH(CH3), CH2– (C2), CH2– (C4), and H. That would make four different substituents, so C3 would be a chiral center. Thus, the molecule would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, if C3 is attached to two CH2 groups, are those two the same? Because the CH2 groups are connected to different parts of the molecule, so they're not identical. So substituents would be:

- CH(CH3)
- CH2–CO–cyclopentyl (from C2)
- CH2–cyclopentyl (from C4)
- H

Wait, no, because from C3's perspective, the substituents are:

- a methyl (CH(CH3) group)
- a CH2 connected to C2 (which is connected to CO–cyclopentyl)
- a CH2 connected to C4 (which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- and H.

So in that case, all four substituents are different, making C3 a chiral center. Hence, the molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

So, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center, so no optical activity.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Two chiral centers, so optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Two chiral centers, so optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This is a meso compound, so no optical activity.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center, so optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Symmetrical, meso, so no optical activity.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center at C3, so optically active.

Wait, but earlier I thought the seventh molecule might not have a chiral center. Hmm, no, earlier I thought it does. So that would be five compounds that are optically active? Let me recount.

Optically active compounds:

2: yes → 1

3: yes → 2

5: yes →3

7: yes →4

Wait, what about the first compound, no. The second, yes. Third, yes (so 1,2,3,5,7? Wait, no, let me count again.

Wait, let's list all seven:

1. No → not active.

2. Yes → active.

3. Yes → active.

4. No → not active.

5. Yes → active.

6. No → not active.

7. Yes → active.

So four compounds (2,3,5,7) are active. Wait, but earlier I thought 2,3,5,7, and maybe another? Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. I thought it's a meso compound, so no optical activity. So that's correct.

So the count is:

Active: 2,3,5,7 → four.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be D)4.

But wait, I might have made a mistake on compound 2. Let me recheck.

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This is a bicyclic compound with two stereogenic centers (3a and 7a), each with R and S configurations respectively. So it's definitely chiral. So yes, it is optically active.

Compound 7: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Earlier, I concluded it has a chiral center at C3, so yes.

So four compounds in total are optically active: 2,3,5,7.

Wait, but earlier I thought of seven compounds, but perhaps I missed one. Let me recount:

Looking back, the seven compounds are:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → no.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → yes.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → yes.

4. (2R,3R)-... → no.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → no.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → yes.

That's four active compounds.

Wait, but let me think about compound 7 again. Could there be a plane of symmetry making it achiral?

If the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–something.

Wait, but in any case, the key is whether the C3 has four different substituents.

If the structure is:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

Then C3 would have:

- CH(CH3)
- CH2 connected to C4 (which is CH2–)
- CH2 connected to C2 (which is CH2–CO–cyclopentyl)
- and H.

So four different groups, making it a chiral center.

So yes, four compounds are active.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups) or exhibits internal asymmetry. Below is the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond, but no chiral centers. The substituents on the carbons of the double bond are not all different, and the molecule lacks internal asymmetry.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a bicyclic compound with stereogenic centers at positions 3a and 7a. The molecule is chiral due to these stereogenic centers.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3. Both carbons are attached to four different groups, making the molecule chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is a meso compound. Although it has two chiral centers, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 makes this carbon a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. The molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. However, the molecule is symmetric, with an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having three stereogenic centers.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a methyl group, a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl, a CH2 group leading to the cyclopentyl group, and a hydrogen. The molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. But wait, are there other possibilities? Oh yeah, sometimes you can have compounds that aren't chiral but still show optical activity because of some kind of internal asymmetry or maybe something else. But I think the main case is the presence of chiral centers.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So if it's 1-chloro, Cl is on C1. And the substituents on the double bond? The double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl attached to the double bond. So maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 2-methylbut-1-ene, I think. Let me draw this. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So:

C1 (Cl attached) is attached to C2, which is attached to a methyl group. So the molecule is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but is that possible? Because but-1-ene is four carbons, double bond starting at C1. So structure is CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 but with double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 → but that's without the double bond. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the double bond. For but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon: Cl–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it would be CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, no, wait. The correct structure is Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether this compound has a chiral center. So, the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's imagine the structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, and perhaps two other substituents. So the substituents on C1 and C2 would be Cl, a CH2 group, and a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So for but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the rest is CH2. Hmm, but in any case, the point is to see if any chiral centers are present.

Now, in this case, since the molecule has a double bond, could that lead to any E or Z isomerism? But the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality. So for the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: does it have any chiral centers? Let's see.

Looking at C1, which is attached to Cl, a double bond (so two substituents), and maybe another CH2 group. Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 has substituents: Cl, a CH2 group (from the double bond), and another CH something. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for any stereogenic centers. Alternatively, maybe I should consider if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, another approach: if a molecule is planar or has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So for (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's think. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two other substituents (maybe CH2 and another group), and C2 has a methyl. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the substituents on C1 and C2 are maybe the same on each side, making it not chiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetric, then it wouldn't be chiral. But wait, in the case of (Z)-configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are same on each carbon. So if on the C1, we have Cl and (say) two CH2 groups, and on C2, we have CH(CH3) and another CH2 group, but maybe they mirror each other. So perhaps the molecule is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Next compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think this is a more complex structure. Let me try to break this down.

Hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: So it's a bicyclic compound. Methano suggests a bridge, perhaps between carbons 4 and 7. The bicyclic system would have a furan ring connected in a way. I'm not exactly visualizing this, but perhaps it's not necessary. The key here is the substituents and whether there's a chiral center.

The substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which is a -CH2Cl group attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified as (3aR,7aS,E), so that suggests that there are stereogenic centers at 3a and 7a, and an E configuration in the double bond.

Wait, but if the molecule has two stereogenic centers (3a and 7a), then it's chiral. So that would mean the molecule is optically active. Because each stereogenic center contributes to the asymmetry.

So this compound should exhibit optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So positions 2 and 3 have methyl groups. The stereocenters are at C2 and C3, with R and S configurations, respectively.

Wait, but wait, in this structure, each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) have CH(CH3) groups attached. Let me think about the substituents on each. For C2 (R configuration):

Groups attached to C2: two CH(CH3), a COOH group, and another carbon. Wait, no, wait. Let's think: the four substituents on each carbon.

Succinic acid is diacid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So adding a methyl on C2 and C3. So C2 has: COOH (from the left), CH(CH3), another CH(CH3), and the central CH2 (but wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the inner carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups attached? Wait, no, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups attached? Or each has one methyl?

Wait, no. 2,3-dimethyl means each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So for C2: substituents are COOH, a methyl, and two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. So each CH2 is C2 and C3. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 and C3 each have a methyl substituent.

So for C2: the groups are COOH (on one side), a methyl group, a CH(CH3) (on the next carbon), and another H? Wait no, wait:

Wait, for HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, the structure is:

O
||O
CH2-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-CH2
But wait, actually, it's:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the CH(CH3) groups is on C2 and C3. So for C2, what are the four substituents? They are:

- One COOH group (from the left)
- A CH(CH3) group (the next carbon)
- A methyl group attached to C2
- And another H? Or is the other group a CH2 or something else?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: the molecule is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no. Each has a methyl, and the rest are connected to the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- One carboxylic acid group (from the left)
- A methyl group (–CH3)
- A single bond to C3 (which is also CH(CH3))
- And another group. Hmm, wait, maybe the carbonyl groups. Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, so each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups, but that can't be right because each can only have four substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it out. The structure is:

O
||
O–C–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–C–O
|| 
O 

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group, and are connected to the adjacent carbons.

Wait, so for C2, the substituents are:

- a carboxylic acid group (from the left)
- a methyl group (–CH3)
- a CH(CH3) on the right (C3)
- and another H?

Wait, no, that can't be, because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps it's:

C2 has:

- a carboxylic acid group (OOC–)
- two CH3 groups (from being 2,3-dimethyl)
- and the adjacent C3.

Wait, no, that's not possible because that would give four substituents. So C2 would have:

- OOC– (from the left)
- CH(CH3) (from the right)
- two CH3 groups (one from 2-methyl, another from 3-methyl?)

Wait, no, that would be two methyl groups attached to C2, which would make it a quaternary center. But that's not possible because in the formula, each of C2 and C3 has only one methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try again. The molecule is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is:

HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. So for C2, the four substituents are:

1. HOOC– group (left)
2. CH(CH3) group (right)
3. a methyl group (from the 2-methyl)
4. what else? Oh, wait, maybe an H.

Hmm, but that would mean C2 is CH(CH3) with an H. So the four substituents would be:

- HOOC– (left)
- CH(CH3) (right)
- CH3 (from 2-methyl)
- H (as the fourth substituent).

Wait, but that would make C2 a chiral center because all four substituents are different. Similarly, C3 would have:

- CH(CH3) (left)
- COOH (right)
- CH3 (3-methyl)
- H.

So both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. So the molecule has two chiral centers, making it a chiral molecule. So it should exhibit optical activity.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. If both C2 and C3 have four different substituents, then they are both chiral centers. So (2R,3S) configuration would make the molecule chiral, leading to optical activity.

So this compound should be optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same structure as the third compound but with both R configurations on C2 and C3.

Wait, but does that matter? If the molecule has two chiral centers, their configuration (R,R) may lead to a meso compound. Because if the molecule is symmetric in some way, it could be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, in the case of tartaric acid, for example, the (R,R) configuration is the meso form, which is achiral. So perhaps this is the same scenario.

So for this compound, are the two chiral centers in such a way that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry?

Looking at the structure:

HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH.

If both C2 and C3 have R configuration, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For instance, imagine a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3; if each has the same configuration and the substituents mirror each other, then the molecule would be achiral.

So in this case, the (2R,3R) configuration might lead to a meso compound, which is not optically active.

So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (the third and fourth carbons), and the hydroxyl is on C1.

So the structure is cyclohexene with substituents at C1 (OH) and double bond at C3-4.

Now, does this compound have a chiral center? The hydroxyl is on C1. Let me imagine the substituents on C1.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the C1 would have the hydroxyl group, a cyclohexene ring (so two adjacent carbons), and another substituent. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, so C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- C2 (which is part of the ring)
- C6 (also part of the ring)
- and a hydrogen or another substituent.

Wait, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring and two substituents. So C1 in cyclohexene would have:

- OH
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C6 and C2)
- And another substituent. Wait, but in the ring structure, each carbon is bonded to two ring carbons and two other groups. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the substituents on C1 are OH, and the other substituent is probably a hydrogen. So the four substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (ring)
- C6 (ring)
- H

So are all four substituents different? Yes:

- OH is unique
- C2 is part of the ring, but not a substituent like a methyl or something else. So if C2 is part of the ring, then C1 is attached to two other ring carbons, which are different from each other and from the substituents. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on the adjacent carbons may vary based on the double bond.

Wait, but in this case, C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So for C1, substituents are:

1. OH
2. C2 (which is CH2 connected to the ring)
3. C6 (which is CH2 connected to the ring)
4. H

Wait, but C2 and C6 are both part of the ring, but are they attached to the same groups? If the ring is asymmetric, then C2 and C6 may have different substituents. But in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the substituents on C2 and C6 may be similar (each has two CH2 groups attached).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether C1 is a chiral center.

If C1 is attached to four distinct groups, then it's a chiral center. The groups are:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) which are part of the ring, but each is connected to different parts of the ring, which may make them different substituents.
- H

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are each connected to the same kinds of substituents, then perhaps they are not different. For example, if both C2 and C6 are each attached to two CH2 groups, then they would be the same as substituents from C1's perspective. In that case, C1 would have substituents: OH, two identical CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and H. So that would make three substituents, but wait, no, because each CH2 is a different group in the ring, but perhaps they are the same from C1's perspective.

Alternatively, perhaps C1 is attached to two different ring carbons (C2 and C6), each of which is connected to different parts of the ring. So from C1's perspective, C2 and C6 are different substituents. So substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (which is connected to the rest of the ring in a certain way)
- C6 (which is connected differently)
- H

If that's the case, then all four substituents are different, making C1 a chiral center. So that would mean the compound is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

Wait, but the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the configuration is R, which implies a chiral center. So yes, this compound would be optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three are s configuration.

Wait, let me think: cyclohexane has six carbons. The substituents are at positions 1,3,5—all s. So the molecule is a triol, with OH groups on alternate carbons.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If so, then it could be achiral despite having multiple stereocenters.

Looking at the arrangement of OH groups: 1,3,5. If all are s, then maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a chair conformation where each OH is axial or equatorial, and the arrangement is symmetrical.

Wait, let's imagine the chair: if each OH is axial, pointing in the same direction (say, all down), then perhaps the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, but if all three substituents are in s configuration, then the arrangement might not be symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, thus achiral.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has all three OH groups in a symmetrical pattern, like arranged in a trigonal manner, perhaps it's not chiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane or axis, then it's achiral.

But in this case, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions, which are every other carbon. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry bisecting the ring, making it achiral. Let me think: imagine a plane cutting through the ring between C2 and C6, for example. If the substituents are symmetrically placed on either side of that plane, then the molecule would be achiral.

So, if all three OH groups are in s configuration, and the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound and not chiral, thus not optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents isn't symmetric. But I'm not entirely sure. I think in this case, the molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. So it does not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, the molecule has three stereocenters, each with s configuration. Let me think about whether their arrangement leads to an overall achiral structure. For example, in a molecule where all substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it's a meso compound.

Like, for example, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all R configurations might be a meso compound if the substituents are symmetrically placed. So in this case, the triol with OH groups at 1,3,5 could be a meso compound, making it achiral.

So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the first carbon of butanone, and a methyl on the third carbon.

Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the structure would be:

cyclopentyl–CH2–CH2–CH(CH3)–CO.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3–CO. So 1-cyclopentyl would be substituting at the first carbon: cyclopentyl–CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–? Wait, no, wait. Butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But wait, no: butan-1-one is (R)–C(=O)–CH2–CH2–CH2–. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The carbonyl is at position 1, so:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But wait, butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

So the structure is (CH2)3–CO.

So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

CO–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Butan-1-one has the carbonyl at the end:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl?

Not sure, but perhaps the key is whether it has any chiral centers.

Looking for any carbon attached to four different groups.

In the structure, the carbonyl is on C1. Then, the substituents on C1 are the carbonyl group, cyclopentyl, and two other substituents. Wait, maybe C3 has a methyl group. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH(CH3)–cyclopentyl.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl.

Wait, but regardless, perhaps the key is to look for any chiral centers.

So looking at each carbon:

C1: carbonyl group (not a chiral center because it's double-bonded to O).

C2: attached to CO, CH(CH3), and two other substituents. Wait, or maybe:

In butan-1-one, C1 is the carbonyl. So the structure would be:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

So 1-cyclopentyl would replace the CH3 group on C4 with cyclopentyl? No, because butan-1-one is four carbons, with the carbonyl on C1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH2–CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)–.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituents.

The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So substituents:

At C1: CO group.

At C2: CH2.

At C3: CH(CH3).

At C4: cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, maybe:

Butan-1-one is:

O
||
C–CH2–CH2–CH2–something.

So 1-cyclopentyl would be attached to the carbonyl carbon. So:

CO– (cyclopentyl) – CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3.

But also, there's a 3-methyl group. So on C3, a methyl is attached.

So the structure would be:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

Wait, regardless, the key is to find any chiral centers.

Looking at C3: in this structure, is C3 attached to four different groups? Let's see.

C3 would have:

- CO–cyclopentyl–CH2– (from one side)
- CH(CH3) (from the other)
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CO–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–cyclopentyl.

Wait, in that case, C2 is attached to CO, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. So substituents: CO, CH(CH3), CH2– (connected to C3), and another CH2– (from C1). So maybe C2 isn't a chiral center.

C3 in this structure would be attached to:

- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH2– (from C4, which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- Two CH2 groups? Or perhaps other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CO–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

So the carbonyl is on C1, attached to cyclopentyl and CH2. Then C2 is CH2 (from CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–), C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2 connected to cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but perhaps the key point is that none of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is attached to four different groups.

Wait, perhaps C3 is attached to:

- a methyl group
- a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl (C1)
- a CH2 group leading to C4 (which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different substituents, making C3 a chiral center. So if that's the case, the molecule would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical activity.

But I'm not entirely confident about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that C3 isn't a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active.

Wait, maybe I should look for any symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it wouldn't be chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is bulky, but that doesn't affect chirality.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at C3, making it optically active.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this one. Let me tentatively say that this compound has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical activity.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers because the substituents on a certain carbon are the same. For instance, if C3 has two CH2 groups attached, then it would have two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, then C3 would have:

- CH(CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one from C2, one to C4)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make four substituents: CH(CH3), CH2– (C2), CH2– (C4), and H. That would make four different substituents, so C3 would be a chiral center. Thus, the molecule would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, if C3 is attached to two CH2 groups, are those two the same? Because the CH2 groups are connected to different parts of the molecule, so they're not identical. So substituents would be:

- CH(CH3)
- CH2–CO–cyclopentyl (from C2)
- CH2–cyclopentyl (from C4)
- H

Wait, no, because from C3's perspective, the substituents are:

- a methyl (CH(CH3) group)
- a CH2 connected to C2 (which is connected to CO–cyclopentyl)
- a CH2 connected to C4 (which is connected to cyclopentyl)
- and H.

So in that case, all four substituents are different, making C3 a chiral center. Hence, the molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

So, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center, so no optical activity.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Two chiral centers, so optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Two chiral centers, so optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This is a meso compound, so no optical activity.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center, so optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Symmetrical, meso, so no optical activity.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center at C3, so optically active.

Wait, but earlier I thought the seventh molecule might not have a chiral center. Hmm, no, earlier I thought it does. So that would be five compounds that are optically active? Let me recount.

Optically active compounds:

2: yes → 1

3: yes → 2

5: yes →3

7: yes →4

Wait, what about the first compound, no. The second, yes. Third, yes (so 1,2,3,5,7? Wait, no, let me count again.

Wait, let's list all seven:

1. No → not active.

2. Yes → active.

3. Yes → active.

4. No → not active.

5. Yes → active.

6. No → not active.

7. Yes → active.

So four compounds (2,3,5,7) are active. Wait, but earlier I thought 2,3,5,7, and maybe another? Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. I thought it's a meso compound, so no optical activity. So that's correct.

So the count is:

Active: 2,3,5,7 → four.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be D)4.

But wait, I might have made a mistake on compound 2. Let me recheck.

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This is a bicyclic compound with two stereogenic centers (3a and 7a), each with R and S configurations respectively. So it's definitely chiral. So yes, it is optically active.

Compound 7: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Earlier, I concluded it has a chiral center at C3, so yes.

So four compounds in total are optically active: 2,3,5,7.

Wait, but earlier I thought of seven compounds, but perhaps I missed one. Let me recount:

Looking back, the seven compounds are:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → no.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → yes.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → yes.

4. (2R,3R)-... → no.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → yes.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → no.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → yes.

That's four active compounds.

Wait, but let me think about compound 7 again. Could there be a plane of symmetry making it achiral?

If the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–something.

Wait, but in any case, the key is whether the C3 has four different substituents.

If the structure is:

CO–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–.

Then C3 would have:

- CH(CH3)
- CH2 connected to C4 (which is CH2–)
- CH2 connected to C2 (which is CH2–CO–cyclopentyl)
- and H.

So four different groups, making it a chiral center.

So yes, four compounds are active.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups) or exhibits internal asymmetry. Below is the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond, but no chiral centers. The substituents on the carbons of the double bond are not all different, and the molecule lacks internal asymmetry.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a bicyclic compound with stereogenic centers at positions 3a and 7a. The molecule is chiral due to these stereogenic centers.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3. Both carbons are attached to four different groups, making the molecule chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is a meso compound. Although it has two chiral centers, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 makes this carbon a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. The molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. However, the molecule is symmetric, with an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having three stereogenic centers.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups: a methyl group, a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl, a CH2 group leading to the cyclopentyl group, and a hydrogen. The molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

### Summary of Optical Activity:
