Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The problem states that the Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Sigma is the Pauli vector, right? So each component of sigma is a Pauli matrix. Oh wait, no, sigma is a vector composed of the Pauli matrices, like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So sigma · n would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. And n is a unit vector, so its components squared add up to one.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1. Because when you diagonalize them, their trace is zero and determinant is -1, so eigenvalues are 1 and -1 (since trace is sum of eigenvalues, sum is zero, so they're equal and opposite). But wait, they're 2x2, so each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1.

The Hamiltonian here is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by epsilon. So H is epsilon multiplied by a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector. Wait, but the Pauli spin matrices are each multiplied by the components of n. So, H = epsilon (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z).

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination like this... I think the eigenvalues of any such combination are plus and minus the magnitude of the coefficient. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and their squares sum to the identity matrix times 3. Wait, no, the sum of the squares of the Pauli matrices is 3I, but each individual Pauli matrix squares to I.

Let me think: Each sigma_i is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±1. So when you have a linear combination like a·sigma (where a is a vector), the eigenvalues would be plus and minus the magnitude of a. Wait, but in this case, the vector is n, which is a unit vector, so the coefficients are n_x, n_y, n_z, which add up to a vector of length 1. But wait, no, because H is epsilon times (sigma · n). So H is proportional to a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by epsilon, right?

Wait, let me think about the properties of the Pauli matrices. The dot product sigma · n is a matrix. What are its eigenvalues? For any unit vector n, the eigenvalues of sigma · n should be 1 and -1. Because sigma · n is essentially the Pauli matrix in the direction of n. For example, if n is along the z-axis, sigma · n is sigma_z, whose eigenvalues are ±1. Same for any direction. So the eigenvalues of sigma · n are ±1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon multiplied by those eigenvalues. So H has eigenvalues +epsilon and -epsilon. Because H is epsilon times (sigma · n), so its eigenvalues are epsilon*(1) and epsilon*(-1).

Looking at the options, option B says +epsilon and -epsilon. So the correct answer should be option B. Let me double-check the other options. Option C has epsilon multiplied by hbar/2. Why would that be the case? Oh wait, maybe if the Hamiltonian were something like sigma · B, where B has some other factors involving hbar. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is simply H = epsilon sigma · n. So no, the eigenvalues would just be ± epsilon.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), we analyze its structure. Here, \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \), i.e., \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \).

The eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix \( \sigma_i \) are \( \pm 1 \). For a general linear combination like \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues are also \( \pm 1 \), provided \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. This is because the dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) corresponds to the Pauli matrix in the direction of \( \vec{n} \), and its eigenvalues remain \( \pm 1 \) regardless of the direction of \( \vec{n} \).

Since the Hamiltonian \( H \) is \( \varepsilon \) times \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not 1.
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because there is no factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in the problem.
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
