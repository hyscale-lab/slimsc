Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see. The question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending up with product 3. Then, we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Hmm, let me break down each step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Looking at the IR data, there's a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows four signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). 

Wait, the reaction of dibromoadamantane with KOH... that's probably an elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, when two bromides are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form an alkene. But in this case, the product has an IR peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a di-elimination, forming a ketone? Wait, no. Or maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement.

Wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a diol (vicinal diol) undergoes elimination upon treatment with acid to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we're starting with a di-bromide. So perhaps it's a double elimination, which forms an alkene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Or perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then KOH is in excess and under high heat—could it lead to further oxidation? Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the positions are such that the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, causing each Br to leave as a bromide ion, then perhaps each elimination forms an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 positions are on the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on carbons that are two apart? Not sure about the structure, but perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an exo-methylene group or something similar.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketene or a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. Oh wait, if two adjacent Brs are eliminated, maybe we form a double bond, but in the presence of a base, could that lead to some kind of cyclization?

Wait, another angle: When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with KOH, they eliminate to form alkenes. But here, it's 1,3-dibromo, so perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a triple bond. Wait, but KOH isn't typically used for that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH has a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial reaction forms a carbonyl group. How? Maybe the base causes a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to a ketone.

Wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on opposite ends. When treated with KOH, maybe each C-Br breaks and forms an alcohol, but wait, KOH is a base, not an aqueous solution. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to elimination, forming a ketone via some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, when a vicinal dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form an alkene, but if the structure is such that elimination leads to a ring formation, perhaps a ketone is formed as a result.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would require aqueous conditions, and KOH is a base. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaves as Br-, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, but what if the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, and then some sort of pericyclic reaction occurs, like electrocyclic opening or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds. If each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give diol. But then, in such a structure, when heated, perhaps the diol could undergo a pinacol rearrangement, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the first step, it's KOH and heat. So the initial product is product 1. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (which has a carbonyl).

If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps the structure is a bicyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of product 1. The signals are 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, the 4.79 ppm is likely an oxygen-bearing group, like an alcohol or an ether. But considering the IR at 1720, which is a carbonyl, perhaps the 4.79 is a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, like a ketone.

Wait, for example, in cyclohexanone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha protons) are around 2.1-2.3 ppm. But in product 1, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests maybe multiple equivalent protons, perhaps from a ring structure.

Alternatively, the 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, maybe an epoxide? But IR doesn't show an epoxide (which typically has peaks around 1200-1250 cm^-1 for the C-O-C). But the IR here is 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but in an ester or an ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that would require more protons, I think.

Wait, another angle: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because the reaction leads to the loss of two equivalents of HBr and the formation of a carbonyl group via some mechanism. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated with the abstraction of two protons, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then a rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene, and then some peracid epoxidation, but no, KOH is a base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. How? I'm not recalling a specific mechanism for that.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about what the product is. Let's move to the next step.

Product 1 is then heated with excess Al(OiPr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide). That's a typical reagent for Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's an acylation.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation involves an acylium ion. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it forms an acylium ion upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, and then undergoes some acylation.

But wait, heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3 forms product 2. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylated compound. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but earlier step with KOH made that less likely.

Wait, let me think again. If product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to the formation of an acylium ion. Then, if product 2 is formed by a Friedel-Crafts reaction, perhaps it's an acylation of another aromatic ring. But wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but product 1 is a ketone. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes some kind of acetylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for some cycloaddition or polymerization. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the second step is a ring-opening. For example, if product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze its opening, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al reagent is used to form an enol ether or another derivative. But I'm not exactly clear.

Wait, after product 2 is formed, it undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond because ozonolysis is used. Let me think about how product 2 is formed. If product 1 is a ketone, and then treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it forms an acylium ion, which could then undergo some addition or rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and the Al reagent is used to form a dienol ether or some other structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is an endo-trig cyclized product. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an annulated compound with a new ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the initial steps again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (carbonyl, NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), other signals).

If product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's 1,3-diketone? Or perhaps it's a bicyclic ketone. For example, if the elimination of two HBr occurs, forming a ketone. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: If each Br is on adjacent carbons (but in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is part of a fused ring system), so elimination of two HBr could lead to a double bond, but perhaps in a way that creates a bridge, forming a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol. How would that happen? From 1,3-dibromide, perhaps the base induces a substitution to form a diol, which then rearranges.

Wait, with KOH and heat, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, giving a diol. Then, under heat, the diol undergoes pinacol rearrangement, forming a carbonyl.

But wait, 1,3-diol would have to rearrange. The pinacol rearrangement typically requires a 1,2-diol. So if product 1 is a 1,3-diol, perhaps under heat, it rearranges to form a ketone via a pinacol-like mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the diol is 1,3-diol, perhaps it can't undergo the pinacol rearrangement. So maybe another mechanism is at play.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol loses water to form a carbonyl.

Wait, if it's a 1,2-diol, the pinacol rearrangement would give a ketone. But in this case, the diol is 1,3, so maybe it's a different rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is formed, but then it undergoes an elimination, forming a carbonyl via deprotonation and loss of water. For example, in a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, maybe the diol loses two water molecules to form a ketone. But 1,3-diol losing water would need two adjacent OH groups, which it doesn't have.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about product 1's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, perhaps a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests maybe a decalin or adamantane-like structure, perhaps equivalent protons. The 1.94 (2H) is another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a compound with an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But that doesn't fit with the IR carbonyl.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2O group, like in a ketone's alpha position. For example, in acetone, the protons are around 2.1 ppm. But here, 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's a neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But then, the IR would show C-O-C. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring attached to oxygen. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is a ketone with a bridge. For example, in adamantane, after elimination of two HBr, a bridgehead ketone is formed. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination, forms a bridgehead double bond, but how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step, but let's proceed to the next steps to see if that gives any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis at -78°C typically gives ozonides which, upon workup with dimethyl sulfide, form carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, product 2 has a double bond. So, perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

So, going back, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which is an alkene.

Wait, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, how would that form an alkene?

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(OiPr)3 is used for some dehydration, forming an alkene. So, if product 1 is a diol, then treatment with Al(OiPr)3 could cause dehydration to form a double bond.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a diol. Then, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 (a strong Lewis acid) would protonate the hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of a double bond via elimination of water.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → 1,3-diol (product 1).

But wait, KOH is a base. If the starting material is a di-bromide, treating with KOH would cause substitution, but in a vicinal dihalide, substitution could lead to a diol. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → reaction with KOH → 1,3-diol (product 1).

Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. The diol would lose two water molecules to form a double bond, giving an alkene (product 2).

So, product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups, giving product 3, which is a diketone or dialdehyde, depending on the structure.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alkene usually gives carbonyl groups on each end. So, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3, we're to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl group, as deshielding occurs near electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls.

In a diketone, the alpha protons (next to the carbonyl) would be deshielded. Depending on the structure, these protons might be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 is a diketone, perhaps with a structure like (CH2)n(CO)2. But depending on the structure, the coupling could vary.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) gives two carbonyl groups, the resulting product 3 could have two ketone groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, (CH2)2(CO)2.

In such a case, each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The protons on the CH2 would be split by neighboring protons. Let's say each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2: in that case, each proton would have two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but wait, the structure after ozonolysis could be something like O=C-R-R-C=O, where R is a CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

In that case, each CH2 group is flanked by another CH2 and a carbonyl. So, each proton on the central CH2 groups would be next to two protons on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the splitting would be more complex. Let me think: each CH2 has two protons. The central CH2 would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons. So, each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is 2,3-diketobutane: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Wait, but that's not possible because butane-2,3-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that would be a four-carbon chain with two ketones. But that structure isn't possible because the two ketones would be on adjacent carbons, leading to a conjugated diketone, which is possible.

In such a structure, the middle two CH2 groups would each have two protons. Each proton on the central CH2 would be next to two protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that would be a four-carbon chain with ketones on C2 and C3. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, but that's not possible because the central CH2 would have the two ketones on either side.

Wait, no, actually, that's a possible structure: 2,3-diketobutane would have the two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 3, with CH2 groups on 1 and 4.

Wait, no, but butane is four carbons. So, it would be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, no, that's 3-ketopentane or something. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a dialdehyde, but that's less likely given the KOH step.

But let's get back to the NMR. The most deshielded proton would be the one next to the carbonyl. In the case of 2,3-diketobutane, the protons on C2 and C3 would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, each CH2 group next to a ketone would have their protons deshielded.

Each of these protons would be split by neighboring protons. Let's say each CH2 has two protons. Each proton on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the CH2 groups are adjacent. So, each CH2 has two protons. Protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl (say, the first CH2) would be next to the protons on the next CH2. So, each proton on the first CH2 would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet for each set of protons.

Wait, but each CH2 has two protons, so the splitting would be based on the neighboring group. So, for each H on the first CH2, the neighboring group is the adjacent CH2 with two H's. So, each H would couple with two equivalent H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, each CH2 is between two others. Wait, no, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the two CH2 groups are next to each other. So, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2.

So, each CH2 group's protons would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group. So, each set of protons would be a triplet.

Wait, but in such a case, each CH2's protons would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded protons (those on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be triplets.

But wait, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which was an alkene. So, the ozonolysis of a symmetric alkene would give a symmetric product. So, if product 2 is a symmetric diene, then product 3 would be a symmetric diketone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is such that ozonolysis gives a four-carbon diketone. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-butadiene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative. Ozonolysis of a cyclohexene would give a diepoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to think about the coupling pattern. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded proton would be next to the carbonyl. Let's say each of these protons is adjacent to two other protons on the same carbon, but wait, that's not possible because each carbon can only have two protons in a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each of these protons is coupled to two protons on one adjacent group and another two on the other adjacent group. Wait, but that's more likely in a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, in an allene or another structure.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the protons on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, in that case, each CH2's protons would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each CH2's protons would couple with two sets of neighboring protons.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. Each proton on a CH2 group would be coupled with the protons on the adjacent CH2 groups.

If each CH2 has two protons, then each proton on the central CH2 would be split by two neighboring groups. For example, the central CH2 has two protons. Each of these protons would be split by the two protons on the left and the two on the right.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting would be more like this: each proton on the central CH2 would see two neighboring groups. Let's say the central CH2 is between two other CH2 groups.

So, each proton on CH2-2 would be next to two protons on CH2-1 and two on CH2-3. So, each H on CH2-2 would split into a triplet from CH2-1 and another triplet from CH2-3. But wait, how does that work?

Wait, the splitting is based on the number of neighboring protons. If a proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons), it would split into a triplet. But if it's next to two different CH2 groups, each contributing their own splitting, the overall pattern becomes more complex.

Wait, for example, if a proton is adjacent to two different sets of two protons each, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Let me think: for a proton (H) that is next to two different groups, each of which has two protons, how would the splitting work?

Each group would cause a splitting. The first group would split the H into a triplet (n=2), and the second group would also split it into a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a 9-line pattern. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, which would be two triplets, each split by the other.

Wait, but the options don't include triplet of triplets; option B is triplet of triplets, option C is doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is only next to one neighboring group with two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in the case where the proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons) on one side and another CH2 group (two protons) on the other, that's two different coupling partners. So each coupling would be a triplet from each side.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling constants might be similar, leading to a more complex pattern. For example, a proton adjacent to two CH2 groups would have two different coupling constants, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each coupling is similar, resulting in a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of neighboring protons. If a proton has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be as follows.

The first neighboring group (n=2) would cause a triplet. The second group (n=2) would cause another triplet. The overall splitting would be the product of each, which is a triplet of triplets, giving 3 x 3 = 9 peaks. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if the two coupling constants are similar, perhaps the splitting is a quintet (n=4), but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets, which would be two triplets, each split by the other.

Wait, maybe the coupling constants are different enough that each triplet splits the other, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about a specific example. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the central CH2 group is between two CH2 groups. Each proton on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two protons on each side.

Wait, no, in O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

But that would be 2,3-diketobutane. Wait, no, that's not possible because butane is four carbons. Let me correct that.

Actually, the correct structure for 2,3-diketobutane is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, but that's five carbons, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit confused with the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a four-carbon diketone, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is impossible because that's a five-carbon chain. Wait, no, but let me think again.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a four-carbon diene, ozonolysis would break it into two two-carbon fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

But in this case, the ozonolysis is done on product 2, which is an alkene, so product 3 would be a dialdehyde or a diketone, depending on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cycloalkene, like cyclohexene. Ozonolysis of cyclohexene would give a diepoxide, but that's not likely in this case. Alternatively, ozonolysis of a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, say, 2-pentene. Ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but considering the initial structure, which is adamantane-based, product 2 would likely have a bridged structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a tricyclic compound with ketone groups.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

If the most deshielded proton is adjacent to two sets of two protons each, perhaps each set leading to a triplet, the overall splitting would be more complex. But the options don't include a triplet of triplets, but option C is a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is adjacent to only one set of two protons, leading to a triplet. So, option A.

Wait, but the question specifies the most deshielded hydrogen. If the structure is such that the deshielded H is next to two protons, it would be a triplet.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that each H is next to two groups, each with two protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but maybe the structure is such that the deshielded H is only adjacent to one set of two protons. For example, in a structure where the H is next to a CH2 group, which has two protons. But in reality, in a diketone, each CH2 group is flanked by two other CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. So, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. In that case, each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

So, each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two H's on the left and two on the right. So, each H would couple with two protons on the left and two on the right. But in reality, each coupling is with the adjacent group.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other. So, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But none of the options is a triplet of triplets except option B.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if the most deshielded H is a triplet of triplets, the answer would be B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is only adjacent to one set of two protons, making it a triplet. That would correspond to option A.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

In a CH2 group between two other CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with two H's on each adjacent CH2. So, for each H, the coupling is with two H's on the left and two H's on the right.

Wait, but each coupling is independent. So, the first coupling (with two H's on the left) would split the peak into a triplet. Then, each of those peaks would be further split by the two H's on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the two coupling constants are similar, leading to a more complex pattern, but in this case, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the deshielded H is only adjacent to one CH2 group, leading to a triplet. But in a symmetric structure, that's unlikely.

Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. So, each CH2 group's protons are adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each H is adjacent to two H's on each side.

Wait, but that would mean each H is coupled with two H's on the left and two on the right. So, each H would split into a triplet from each side, making a triplet of triplets.

But in reality, the coupling constants for each adjacent group might be similar, leading to a more complex pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the two coupling constants are different, making it a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose we have a structure like CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3. The central CH2 groups would each have two H's, and each H is next to two H's on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet of triplets.

But in reality, the splitting is usually a triplet because the two adjacent H's are equivalent, leading to a triplet. But in this case, each H is adjacent to two H's on each side, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but in reality, for a CH2 group between two CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would see four neighboring H's (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks). But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded H is only adjacent to one CH2 group, making it a triplet.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, and the problem statement, I think the correct answer is a triplet, as each H is coupled with two H's from one adjacent group.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the H is coupled with two groups, leading to a triplet of triplets. However, looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, and option C is doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and one H on the other. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is only adjacent to one CH2 group. For instance, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 group is next to another CH2. So, each H on the left CH2 is next to two H's on the right CH2, and vice versa.

So, each H on the left CH2 would see two H's on the right, leading to a triplet. Similarly, each H on the right would see two on the left, also a triplet.

But in the overall molecule, the splitting would be a triplet for each H. So, perhaps the most deshielded H is a triplet.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and another two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but in the NMR, the splitting would be based on all neighboring H's. So, each H would be split by the H's on both adjacent groups.

In that case, the splitting would be more complex, but perhaps in this scenario, the coupling constants are similar, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not certain. I think the correct answer is a triplet, so option A.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with product 3, where the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum of product 3 needs to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   The reaction likely involves elimination of HBr, forming a diol (1,3-diol) as product 1. The IR spectrum shows a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a rearrangement or further reaction to form a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports the formation of a ketone with specific proton environments.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates dehydration of the diol or ketone, forming an alkene (product 2). This step sets up the molecule for ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which is a diketone or dialdehyde. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen is near a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is adjacent to two equivalent protons on one side, it would exhibit a triplet splitting pattern. However, if it is coupled with protons on two different adjacent groups, the splitting could be more complex, such as a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets. Based on the options provided and the likely structure of product 3, the most plausible splitting pattern is a triplet.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see. The question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending up with product 3. Then, we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Hmm, let me break down each step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Looking at the IR data, there's a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows four signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). 

Wait, the reaction of dibromoadamantane with KOH... that's probably an elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, when two bromides are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form an alkene. But in this case, the product has an IR peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a di-elimination, forming a ketone? Wait, no. Or maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement.

Wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a diol (vicinal diol) undergoes elimination upon treatment with acid to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we're starting with a di-bromide. So perhaps it's a double elimination, which forms an alkene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Or perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then KOH is in excess and under high heat—could it lead to further oxidation? Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the positions are such that the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, causing each Br to leave as a bromide ion, then perhaps each elimination forms an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 positions are on the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on carbons that are two apart? Not sure about the structure, but perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an exo-methylene group or something similar.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketene or a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. Oh wait, if two adjacent Brs are eliminated, maybe we form a double bond, but in the presence of a base, could that lead to some kind of cyclization?

Wait, another angle: When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with KOH, they eliminate to form alkenes. But here, it's 1,3-dibromo, so perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a triple bond. Wait, but KOH isn't typically used for that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH has a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial reaction forms a carbonyl group. How? Maybe the base causes a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to a ketone.

Wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on opposite ends. When treated with KOH, maybe each C-Br breaks and forms an alcohol, but wait, KOH is a base, not an aqueous solution. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to elimination, forming a ketone via some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, when a vicinal dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form an alkene, but if the structure is such that elimination leads to a ring formation, perhaps a ketone is formed as a result.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would require aqueous conditions, and KOH is a base. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaves as Br-, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, but what if the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, and then some sort of pericyclic reaction occurs, like electrocyclic opening or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds. If each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give diol. But then, in such a structure, when heated, perhaps the diol could undergo a pinacol rearrangement, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the first step, it's KOH and heat. So the initial product is product 1. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (which has a carbonyl).

If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps the structure is a bicyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of product 1. The signals are 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, the 4.79 ppm is likely an oxygen-bearing group, like an alcohol or an ether. But considering the IR at 1720, which is a carbonyl, perhaps the 4.79 is a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, like a ketone.

Wait, for example, in cyclohexanone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha protons) are around 2.1-2.3 ppm. But in product 1, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests maybe multiple equivalent protons, perhaps from a ring structure.

Alternatively, the 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, maybe an epoxide? But IR doesn't show an epoxide (which typically has peaks around 1200-1250 cm^-1 for the C-O-C). But the IR here is 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but in an ester or an ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that would require more protons, I think.

Wait, another angle: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because the reaction leads to the loss of two equivalents of HBr and the formation of a carbonyl group via some mechanism. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated with the abstraction of two protons, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then a rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene, and then some peracid epoxidation, but no, KOH is a base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. How? I'm not recalling a specific mechanism for that.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about what the product is. Let's move to the next step.

Product 1 is then heated with excess Al(OiPr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide). That's a typical reagent for Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's an acylation.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation involves an acylium ion. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it forms an acylium ion upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, and then undergoes some acylation.

But wait, heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3 forms product 2. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylated compound. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but earlier step with KOH made that less likely.

Wait, let me think again. If product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to the formation of an acylium ion. Then, if product 2 is formed by a Friedel-Crafts reaction, perhaps it's an acylation of another aromatic ring. But wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but product 1 is a ketone. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes some kind of acetylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for some cycloaddition or polymerization. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the second step is a ring-opening. For example, if product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze its opening, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al reagent is used to form an enol ether or another derivative. But I'm not exactly clear.

Wait, after product 2 is formed, it undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond because ozonolysis is used. Let me think about how product 2 is formed. If product 1 is a ketone, and then treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it forms an acylium ion, which could then undergo some addition or rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and the Al reagent is used to form a dienol ether or some other structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is an endo-trig cyclized product. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an annulated compound with a new ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the initial steps again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (carbonyl, NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), other signals).

If product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's 1,3-diketone? Or perhaps it's a bicyclic ketone. For example, if the elimination of two HBr occurs, forming a ketone. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: If each Br is on adjacent carbons (but in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is part of a fused ring system), so elimination of two HBr could lead to a double bond, but perhaps in a way that creates a bridge, forming a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol. How would that happen? From 1,3-dibromide, perhaps the base induces a substitution to form a diol, which then rearranges.

Wait, with KOH and heat, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, giving a diol. Then, under heat, the diol undergoes pinacol rearrangement, forming a carbonyl.

But wait, 1,3-diol would have to rearrange. The pinacol rearrangement typically requires a 1,2-diol. So if product 1 is a 1,3-diol, perhaps under heat, it rearranges to form a ketone via a pinacol-like mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the diol is 1,3-diol, perhaps it can't undergo the pinacol rearrangement. So maybe another mechanism is at play.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol loses water to form a carbonyl.

Wait, if it's a 1,2-diol, the pinacol rearrangement would give a ketone. But in this case, the diol is 1,3, so maybe it's a different rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is formed, but then it undergoes an elimination, forming a carbonyl via deprotonation and loss of water. For example, in a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, maybe the diol loses two water molecules to form a ketone. But 1,3-diol losing water would need two adjacent OH groups, which it doesn't have.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about product 1's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, perhaps a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests maybe a decalin or adamantane-like structure, perhaps equivalent protons. The 1.94 (2H) is another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a compound with an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But that doesn't fit with the IR carbonyl.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2O group, like in a ketone's alpha position. For example, in acetone, the protons are around 2.1 ppm. But here, 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's a neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But then, the IR would show C-O-C. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring attached to oxygen. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is a ketone with a bridge. For example, in adamantane, after elimination of two HBr, a bridgehead ketone is formed. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination, forms a bridgehead double bond, but how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step, but let's proceed to the next steps to see if that gives any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis at -78°C typically gives ozonides which, upon workup with dimethyl sulfide, form carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, product 2 has a double bond. So, perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

So, going back, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which is an alkene.

Wait, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, how would that form an alkene?

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(OiPr)3 is used for some dehydration, forming an alkene. So, if product 1 is a diol, then treatment with Al(OiPr)3 could cause dehydration to form a double bond.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a diol. Then, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 (a strong Lewis acid) would protonate the hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of a double bond via elimination of water.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → 1,3-diol (product 1).

But wait, KOH is a base. If the starting material is a di-bromide, treating with KOH would cause substitution, but in a vicinal dihalide, substitution could lead to a diol. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → reaction with KOH → 1,3-diol (product 1).

Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. The diol would lose two water molecules to form a double bond, giving an alkene (product 2).

So, product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups, giving product 3, which is a diketone or dialdehyde, depending on the structure.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alkene usually gives carbonyl groups on each end. So, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3, we're to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl group, as deshielding occurs near electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls.

In a diketone, the alpha protons (next to the carbonyl) would be deshielded. Depending on the structure, these protons might be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 is a diketone, perhaps with a structure like (CH2)n(CO)2. But depending on the structure, the coupling could vary.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) gives two carbonyl groups, the resulting product 3 could have two ketone groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, (CH2)2(CO)2.

In such a case, each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The protons on the CH2 would be split by neighboring protons. Let's say each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2: in that case, each proton would have two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but wait, the structure after ozonolysis could be something like O=C-R-R-C=O, where R is a CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

In that case, each CH2 group is flanked by another CH2 and a carbonyl. So, each proton on the central CH2 groups would be next to two protons on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the splitting would be more complex. Let me think: each CH2 has two protons. The central CH2 would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons. So, each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is 2,3-diketobutane: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Wait, but that's not possible because butane-2,3-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that would be a four-carbon chain with two ketones. But that structure isn't possible because the two ketones would be on adjacent carbons, leading to a conjugated diketone, which is possible.

In such a structure, the middle two CH2 groups would each have two protons. Each proton on the central CH2 would be next to two protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that would be a four-carbon chain with ketones on C2 and C3. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, but that's not possible because the central CH2 would have the two ketones on either side.

Wait, no, actually, that's a possible structure: 2,3-diketobutane would have the two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 3, with CH2 groups on 1 and 4.

Wait, no, but butane is four carbons. So, it would be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, no, that's 3-ketopentane or something. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a dialdehyde, but that's less likely given the KOH step.

But let's get back to the NMR. The most deshielded proton would be the one next to the carbonyl. In the case of 2,3-diketobutane, the protons on C2 and C3 would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, each CH2 group next to a ketone would have their protons deshielded.

Each of these protons would be split by neighboring protons. Let's say each CH2 has two protons. Each proton on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the CH2 groups are adjacent. So, each CH2 has two protons. Protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl (say, the first CH2) would be next to the protons on the next CH2. So, each proton on the first CH2 would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet for each set of protons.

Wait, but each CH2 has two protons, so the splitting would be based on the neighboring group. So, for each H on the first CH2, the neighboring group is the adjacent CH2 with two H's. So, each H would couple with two equivalent H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, each CH2 is between two others. Wait, no, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the two CH2 groups are next to each other. So, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2.

So, each CH2 group's protons would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group. So, each set of protons would be a triplet.

Wait, but in such a case, each CH2's protons would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded protons (those on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be triplets.

But wait, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which was an alkene. So, the ozonolysis of a symmetric alkene would give a symmetric product. So, if product 2 is a symmetric diene, then product 3 would be a symmetric diketone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is such that ozonolysis gives a four-carbon diketone. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-butadiene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative. Ozonolysis of a cyclohexene would give a diepoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to think about the coupling pattern. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded proton would be next to the carbonyl. Let's say each of these protons is adjacent to two other protons on the same carbon, but wait, that's not possible because each carbon can only have two protons in a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each of these protons is coupled to two protons on one adjacent group and another two on the other adjacent group. Wait, but that's more likely in a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, in an allene or another structure.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the protons on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, in that case, each CH2's protons would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each CH2's protons would couple with two sets of neighboring protons.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. Each proton on a CH2 group would be coupled with the protons on the adjacent CH2 groups.

If each CH2 has two protons, then each proton on the central CH2 would be split by two neighboring groups. For example, the central CH2 has two protons. Each of these protons would be split by the two protons on the left and the two on the right.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting would be more like this: each proton on the central CH2 would see two neighboring groups. Let's say the central CH2 is between two other CH2 groups.

So, each proton on CH2-2 would be next to two protons on CH2-1 and two on CH2-3. So, each H on CH2-2 would split into a triplet from CH2-1 and another triplet from CH2-3. But wait, how does that work?

Wait, the splitting is based on the number of neighboring protons. If a proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons), it would split into a triplet. But if it's next to two different CH2 groups, each contributing their own splitting, the overall pattern becomes more complex.

Wait, for example, if a proton is adjacent to two different sets of two protons each, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Let me think: for a proton (H) that is next to two different groups, each of which has two protons, how would the splitting work?

Each group would cause a splitting. The first group would split the H into a triplet (n=2), and the second group would also split it into a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is a 9-line pattern. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, which would be two triplets, each split by the other.

Wait, but the options don't include triplet of triplets; option B is triplet of triplets, option C is doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is only next to one neighboring group with two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in the case where the proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons) on one side and another CH2 group (two protons) on the other, that's two different coupling partners. So each coupling would be a triplet from each side.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling constants might be similar, leading to a more complex pattern. For example, a proton adjacent to two CH2 groups would have two different coupling constants, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each coupling is similar, resulting in a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of neighboring protons. If a proton has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be as follows.

The first neighboring group (n=2) would cause a triplet. The second group (n=2) would cause another triplet. The overall splitting would be the product of each, which is a triplet of triplets, giving 3 x 3 = 9 peaks. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if the two coupling constants are similar, perhaps the splitting is a quintet (n=4), but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets, which would be two triplets, each split by the other.

Wait, maybe the coupling constants are different enough that each triplet splits the other, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about a specific example. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the central CH2 group is between two CH2 groups. Each proton on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two protons on each side.

Wait, no, in O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

But that would be 2,3-diketobutane. Wait, no, that's not possible because butane is four carbons. Let me correct that.

Actually, the correct structure for 2,3-diketobutane is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, but that's five carbons, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit confused with the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a four-carbon diketone, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is impossible because that's a five-carbon chain. Wait, no, but let me think again.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a four-carbon diene, ozonolysis would break it into two two-carbon fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

But in this case, the ozonolysis is done on product 2, which is an alkene, so product 3 would be a dialdehyde or a diketone, depending on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cycloalkene, like cyclohexene. Ozonolysis of cyclohexene would give a diepoxide, but that's not likely in this case. Alternatively, ozonolysis of a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, say, 2-pentene. Ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but considering the initial structure, which is adamantane-based, product 2 would likely have a bridged structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a tricyclic compound with ketone groups.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

If the most deshielded proton is adjacent to two sets of two protons each, perhaps each set leading to a triplet, the overall splitting would be more complex. But the options don't include a triplet of triplets, but option C is a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is adjacent to only one set of two protons, leading to a triplet. So, option A.

Wait, but the question specifies the most deshielded hydrogen. If the structure is such that the deshielded H is next to two protons, it would be a triplet.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that each H is next to two groups, each with two protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but maybe the structure is such that the deshielded H is only adjacent to one set of two protons. For example, in a structure where the H is next to a CH2 group, which has two protons. But in reality, in a diketone, each CH2 group is flanked by two other CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. So, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. In that case, each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

So, each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two H's on the left and two on the right. So, each H would couple with two protons on the left and two on the right. But in reality, each coupling is with the adjacent group.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other. So, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But none of the options is a triplet of triplets except option B.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if the most deshielded H is a triplet of triplets, the answer would be B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is only adjacent to one set of two protons, making it a triplet. That would correspond to option A.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

In a CH2 group between two other CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with two H's on each adjacent CH2. So, for each H, the coupling is with two H's on the left and two H's on the right.

Wait, but each coupling is independent. So, the first coupling (with two H's on the left) would split the peak into a triplet. Then, each of those peaks would be further split by the two H's on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the two coupling constants are similar, leading to a more complex pattern, but in this case, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the deshielded H is only adjacent to one CH2 group, leading to a triplet. But in a symmetric structure, that's unlikely.

Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. So, each CH2 group's protons are adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each H is adjacent to two H's on each side.

Wait, but that would mean each H is coupled with two H's on the left and two on the right. So, each H would split into a triplet from each side, making a triplet of triplets.

But in reality, the coupling constants for each adjacent group might be similar, leading to a more complex pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the two coupling constants are different, making it a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose we have a structure like CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3. The central CH2 groups would each have two H's, and each H is next to two H's on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet of triplets.

But in reality, the splitting is usually a triplet because the two adjacent H's are equivalent, leading to a triplet. But in this case, each H is adjacent to two H's on each side, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but in reality, for a CH2 group between two CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would see four neighboring H's (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks). But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded H is only adjacent to one CH2 group, making it a triplet.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, and the problem statement, I think the correct answer is a triplet, as each H is coupled with two H's from one adjacent group.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the H is coupled with two groups, leading to a triplet of triplets. However, looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, and option C is doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and one H on the other. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is only adjacent to one CH2 group. For instance, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, each CH2 group is next to another CH2. So, each H on the left CH2 is next to two H's on the right CH2, and vice versa.

So, each H on the left CH2 would see two H's on the right, leading to a triplet. Similarly, each H on the right would see two on the left, also a triplet.

But in the overall molecule, the splitting would be a triplet for each H. So, perhaps the most deshielded H is a triplet.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and another two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but in the NMR, the splitting would be based on all neighboring H's. So, each H would be split by the H's on both adjacent groups.

In that case, the splitting would be more complex, but perhaps in this scenario, the coupling constants are similar, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not certain. I think the correct answer is a triplet, so option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with product 3, where the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum of product 3 needs to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   The reaction likely involves elimination of HBr, forming a diol (1,3-diol) as product 1. The IR spectrum shows a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a rearrangement or further reaction to form a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports the formation of a ketone with specific proton environments.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates dehydration of the diol or ketone, forming an alkene (product 2). This step sets up the molecule for ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which is a diketone or dialdehyde. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen is near a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is adjacent to two equivalent protons on one side, it would exhibit a triplet splitting pattern. However, if it is coupled with protons on two different adjacent groups, the splitting could be more complex, such as a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets. Based on the options provided and the likely structure of product 3, the most plausible splitting pattern is a triplet.
