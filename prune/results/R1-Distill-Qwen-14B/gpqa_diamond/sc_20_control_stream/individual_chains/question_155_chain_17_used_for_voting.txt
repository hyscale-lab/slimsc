Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're given the state as a column vector. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form, and the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. 

Hmm, right. So, first, I should remember how to calculate the uncertainty in an observable. Oh right, the uncertainty principle. The formula for the uncertainty ΔA is the square root of the expectation value of A squared minus the square of the expectation value of A. So ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²).

So, in this case, I need to compute ΔP_z, which means I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩. 

Wait, but the state given is an eigenstate of P_x. Oh, right, but to find the expectation values of P_z, I need to express the state in terms of the eigenbasis of P_z because the operators don't commute. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that's good because the matrix for P_z in this basis should be diagonal.

Wait, looking at the matrix for P_z: the first row is (ℏ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ℏ). So the matrix is diagonal with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So the basis vectors are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, corresponding to these eigenvalues.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, no, the state is given as a column vector with these elements. So it's a three-component vector. Let me write that down: the state |ψ⟩ is [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. Or, written as components, ψ = c₁|1⟩ + c₂|2⟩ + c₃|3⟩.

So, since it's already expressed in the P_z basis, the coefficients c₁, c₂, c₃ are the components themselves. So c₁ = -1/2, c₂ = 1/√2, c₃ = -1/2.

Wait, but wait: when I compute expectation values, I can use the components in the basis. For an observable that's diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. But wait, that applies when the observable is diagonal. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, yes, this should work.

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can just compute Σ |c_i|² * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues of P_z.

Let's compute that. 

First, calculate |c₁|². c₁ is -1/2, so squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c₂ is 1/√2, so |c₂|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c₃ is -1/2, so |c₃|^2 is 1/4.

Now, the eigenvalues for P_z are ℏ (for |1⟩), 0 (for |2⟩), and -ℏ (for |3⟩).

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (1/4 -1/4)ℏ = 0. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be each diagonal element squared. So the matrix for P_z squared would be [ (ℏ)^2, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0, (−ℏ)^2 ] → [ ℏ², 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0,ℏ² ].

So to find ⟨P_z²⟩, it's again the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by (λ_i)^2.

So, same coefficients: |c₁|² = 1/4 → 1/4 * (ℏ²) → (ℏ²)/4.

|c₂|² = 1/2 → 1/2 * 0 = 0.

|c₃|² = 1/4 → 1/4 * (ℏ²) → (ℏ²)/4.

Adding them up: (ℏ²/4) + 0 + (ℏ²/4) = (ℏ²/2).

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = ℏ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (ℏ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt(ℏ²/2) = (ℏ) / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B) ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait another thing: the state is given as the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. But when I compute the expectation values of P_z, since the state is expressed in the P_z basis, the calculations are straightforward. Because the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, the uncertainty should be non-zero, which it is.

Another check: The state's components are: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me confirm that it's normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the calculation seems correct. The uncertainty is sqrt( (ℏ²/2) ) = ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is expressed as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the operator $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The coefficients of the state are:

\[
c_1 = -1/2, \quad c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}, \quad c_3 = -1/2.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Compute $|c_i|^2$:

\[
|c_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, \quad |c_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2, \quad |c_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.
\]

Substitute into $\langle P_z \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (1/4) \cdot \hbar + (1/2) \cdot 0 + (1/4) \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in the $P_z$ basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substitute $|c_i|^2$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4) \cdot \hbar^2 + (1/2) \cdot 0 + (1/4) \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2/2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
