Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. So, the target is a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, wait. Let me get the numbering right. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering can be a bit tricky. Let me visualize it. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So that's a meta arrangement for two substituents and ortho for the ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, but I think the order in which the substituents are added matters because of the directing effects.

Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. Electrophiles are added according to the directing groups present. So, the order of adding substituents will determine where the next one attaches.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups are activating (ortho/para), but wait, ethoxy is an ether group, which is an activating, ortho/para directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating, and as a strong ortho/para director because it's an alkyl group.

Wait, but once a substituent is added, the next substituent will be directed by the existing substituents. So, the sequence of adding substituents will influence the positions.

So, the target molecule has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me think about how each substituent is added.

Let's try to plan the synthesis. I think the best approach is to decide the order of adding the substituents. Since nitro is a deactivating group, perhaps it's better to add it later when the benzene ring has activating groups, making it easier to introduce.

Wait, no. Wait, nitro groups are meta directors. If I add nitro early on, perhaps it will complicate the addition of other groups because the ring will be deactivated. So maybe add nitro last.

Alternatively, let me think about each substituent's priority in terms of introducing. Let's see:

We have three substituents:

1. tert-butyl (from tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 as catalyst)
2. ethoxy (from ethyl bromide with NaOH? Or maybe via a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely using AlCl3 as a catalyst in an electrophilic substitution)
3. nitro (from HNO3 with H2SO4 as catalyst, I think that's the standard nitration.)

Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group, so perhaps adding it first would allow other groups to be added in certain positions.

But wait, another consideration: the nitro group is a strong meta director. So if I add nitro early, the next substituents might be directed to meta positions relative to it, which might not be desired here. So maybe adding nitro last.

So, let's think about the order. Let's say we first introduce the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, and finally the nitro. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, the substituents in the target are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, if I add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but when adding substituents, each new group will be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add nitro first, but that might complicate the other substitutions because nitro is deactivating. Hmm.

Another approach: let's consider the positions. The target has three substituents in adjacent positions, which is perhaps a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, how would that happen? Let's think.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent. So, to get all three, maybe each substitution happens in a specific order where each new group is added in the correct relative position.

Let me think of adding substituents in the order: ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl. Or ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

Wait, but ethoxy is activating, so after adding ethoxy, the next substitution would be either ortho or para to it. Then, after adding the tert-butyl, perhaps the nitro can be added in the correct position.

Alternatively, maybe adding tert-butyl first. Let's think.

Suppose we add tert-butyl first. Then, the ring is activated, and the next substituent would be ortho or para to it. Let's say we add ethoxy next. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the ethoxy would add either ortho or para. Then, the third substituent, nitro, would be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so it's better to add it when the ring is still activated. Alternatively, perhaps after adding nitro, the ring becomes deactivating, which would affect the next substitution.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl group, and then the nitro group. Let's see.

So, starting with benzene:

1. Add ethoxy group. Using ethyl chloride with AlCl3 as a catalyst in an electrophilic substitution. Wait, no, ethoxy is usually introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, ethoxylation is typically done using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, no. Wait, ethoxy groups are usually introduced via an etherification reaction, which can be done through a nucleophilic substitution using an alkyl halide and a base, but in the context of benzene, it's more likely that the ethoxy group is added via an electrophilic substitution, perhaps using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 as a catalyst. Wait, but wait. Friedel-Crafts alkylation uses AlCl3 as a catalyst to generate an electrophile from an alkyl chloride, which then attacks the benzene ring. But ethyl chloride can undergo Friedel-Crafts to add an ethyl group, but that would give an ethyl substituent, not an ethoxy group. Hmm, wait. Alternatively, introducing an ethoxy group would require a different approach. Wait, perhaps using an ethyl bromide with a strong base? Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that generally requires activating groups, which benzene doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via the formation of an ether using Williamson synthesis, but that requires an alkoxide. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be added via an SN2 reaction, but that's not typically applicable to benzene. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via an electrophilic substitution using a tosylate or something else. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's not common without activating groups.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a point. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification reaction, where an ethyl halide reacts with a strong base, like NaOH, to substitute a leaving group. But benzene doesn't have a leaving group, so that approach might not work directly.

Wait, perhaps instead, the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would introduce a carbonyl group, which isn't the case here. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on this.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the ethoxy group as being introduced via a nucleophilic substitution with an alkoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using ethyl bromide and a strong base, but I'm not sure how that would proceed on benzene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options given. Oh, the options involve steps like AlCl3, HNO3, Fe/HCl, etc. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, which would add an ethyl group. Wait, but that would be an ethyl substituent, not an ethoxy. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the ethoxy group is added using a different method, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope here. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where the benzene ring is first converted into a diazonium salt, then treated with something to replace the amino group with an ethoxy group. Wait, that might be a possible approach.

Wait, but in the options, I see steps like NaNO2/HCl (which would form a diazonium salt), and H3O+ and heat (which would decompose the diazonium salt to produce a ring with a leaving group, perhaps allowing substitution). For example, after diazotization, the ring could undergo a substitution reaction with, say, ethanol under certain conditions. But I'm not sure if that's a standard method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via the Gattermannâ€“Koch reaction, which adds a formyl group, but that wouldn't give an ethoxy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem by looking at the options and their steps, and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4

Hmm, that's a lot of steps. Let me try to parse each option.

Wait, the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, the correct sequence should involve adding each of these groups in the correct order.

In option D, the steps are: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction step?), iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, iv) HNO3/H2SO4 again, and so on.

But adding nitro first would make the ring deactivating, which would make adding other groups harder. So perhaps that's not the best approach.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3/H2SO4; ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, Fe/HCl is a typical setup for a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps in the context of a nitro group being reduced. Wait, but Fe/HCl is used to reduce a nitro group to an amine? Or perhaps it's used in a different context.

Alternatively, maybe Fe/HCl is used for a diazotization step. Wait, no, diazotization is done with NaNO2 and HCl, typically at low temperatures.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each step in the options.

Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, step ii in option C is SO3/H2SO4. That's probably sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so maybe this is a protecting group or a directing group for subsequent reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the steps and how each substituent is added.

Wait, let's think about the correct order of adding substituents. Let's say, first, we add the tert-butyl group, then the ethoxy, then the nitro. Or perhaps another order.

Wait, the target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps when the ethoxy and tert-butyl are already present, adding nitro in the third position would be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in the correct position based on the directing effects of the other groups.

Wait, another approach: since the ethoxy is an activating group, perhaps it's better to add it after the nitro group, so that the nitro group doesn't deactivate the ring too early.

Hmm, perhaps the nitro group should be added last. So, the steps would be: add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me think.

First, benzene is treated with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) to add the tert-butyl group. Then, perhaps the next substituent is added. But where would the ethoxy group go?

Wait, after adding the tert-butyl group, the ring is activated (since alkyl groups are activating), so the next substitution would be ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, and the tert-butyl at position 2 (assuming numbering where position 1 is ortho to position 2). Wait, perhaps the ethoxy would be added in the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group.

Then, the third substituent, nitro, would be added in the meta position relative to the ethoxy group, perhaps?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps after adding the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups in positions 2 and 1, respectively, the nitro group would be added in position 3, which is adjacent to both.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, so their position would influence where the next substituent is added. But in this case, nitro is the last substituent to be added. So perhaps after adding tert-butyl and ethoxy, the ring still has activating groups, so the nitro group can be introduced in the correct position.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So, if I add nitro last, perhaps it's easier to direct where it goes.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact steps. Maybe I should think about each option's sequence and see which one makes sense.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration of benzene. So, nitro group is added first.

But adding nitro first would make the ring deactivating, so the next substitution would be harder. But perhaps the next step is adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitration.

So option D's steps after nitration are: Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. But if the ring is deactivated by nitro, the Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed. So option D is likely incorrect.

Option A: starts with tert-butyl chloride. So, benzene â†’ add tert-butyl. Then, nitration (ii) HNO3/H2SO4. So, benzene with tert-butyl group, then add nitro in a position directed by tert-butyl. Then, iii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation. Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. Maybe this is a protective step.

But then iv) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. Then v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium salt to something else. vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ perhaps another hydrolysis step. vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ maybe an SN2 substitution to introduce ethoxy. viii) Fe/HCl â†’ perhaps reduction. ix) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again.

Hmm, but this seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it would lead to the correct substituents.

Option B: starts with tert-butyl chloride. Then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction of nitro to amine?), then another nitration? That seems odd.

Option C: starts with tert-butyl chloride. Then sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4), which adds a sulfonic acid group. Then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine?), then diazotization, another nitration, hydrolysis, dilute H2SO4, and then NaOH/EtBr.

This seems a bit convoluted, and I'm not sure if the sulfonic acid group is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

Wait, but how to add the ethoxy group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after making a diazonium salt.

So, perhaps the steps would be:

Benzene â†’ nitrate â†’ then reduce nitro to amine â†’ make diazonium salt â†’ perform a substitution with ethoxide?

Wait, but that might be a way to add an ethoxy group. Let me think.

Wait, if I have a benzene ring with a nitro group, which is meta-directing. Then, if I reduce the nitro group to an amine, which is a strong activating group, then I can perform another substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to add the ethoxy group via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride and AlCl3. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, if I have a nitro group, which can be converted into a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with a strong acid can lose N2 and form a benzylic carbocation, but I'm not sure if that would allow substitution with an ethoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that typically requires electron-withdrawing groups, making the ring more susceptible to attack by a nucleophile.

Wait, if I have a nitro group on the ring, perhaps that can activate certain positions for nucleophilic substitution. For example, the nitro group is electron-withdrawing, so the ring is deactivating, but positions ortho and para to the nitro group might be more activated for nucleophilic attack.

But I'm not very confident about this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would add a ketone group, which isn't what we need.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D: steps are first nitration, then Fe/HCl, which might be a reduction of nitro to amine. Then add the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts. Then nitrate again, and so on.

But as I thought before, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work. So option D is unlikely.

Option B: starts with tert-butyl, then nitration. After nitration, Fe/HCl. Fe/HCl is often used in the hydrolysis of nitrobenzene to phenol, but that would require more than just Fe/HCl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction step, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has three substituents, so perhaps the correct option includes three nitration steps or similar.

Wait, looking at the options, option B has two nitration steps (ii and iv), while option C has two as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

But how to add the ethoxy group. Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene â†’ nitrate â†’ add nitro group.

2. Reduce nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl?), making an amino group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director.

3. Then, introduce the ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group, which is a strong meta director.

Wait, but this is getting too confusing. Let me try another approach.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (probably activating, ortho/para director), tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para), and nitro (deactivating, meta).

So, the directing effects of each group will influence where the next substituent is added. So, the order of addition is crucial.

Suppose we add the tert-butyl group first. Then the ring is activated. Next, we add the ethoxy group, which will be ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Then, the nitro group is added in a position directed by both the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups.

Wait, but with two activating groups, the next substituent's position could be influenced by both. So, perhaps the nitro group ends up in a position that's meta to one group and ortho to another.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

Adding ethoxy first: benzene â†’ ethoxybenzene.

Then, add tert-butyl group: in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Let's choose the para position for simplicity. Now, the ring has ethoxy at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 4.

Now, adding nitro. Nitro is a meta director. But the ring has two activating groups, so perhaps the nitro group can be added in a position that's ortho or para to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs in a position influenced by the strongest director. Since ethoxy is more activating than tert-butyl, perhaps the nitro group would add ortho or para to the ethoxy group, but considering the tert-butyl group's position, maybe it's possible to get the nitro in position 3.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next nitration would be at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is not the correct order, and I should think about another approach.

Another approach: the correct sequence is to add the tert-butyl group first, then the nitro group, and then the ethoxy group. But how would that work.

Wait, adding tert-butyl first: benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene. Then, nitration would add nitro in ortho, meta, or para. Since tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, nitro might be added in ortho or para.

Wait, but if tert-butyl is at position 1, then nitro might be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Let's say it's added at position 3, which is meta to tert-butyl. Wait, no, because tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, so nitro would be added in ortho or para. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: ethoxy first â†’ tert-butyl â†’ nitro.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro group is added in the third position, which is adjacent to both.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group and tert-butyl are in adjacent positions, allowing the nitro group to be added in the next adjacent position.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: the sequence is nitration first, then Fe/HCl. Fe/HCl is often used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines. Then, add tert-butyl via AlCl3. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts (which requires AlCl3 and an alkyl chloride) may not work. So, option D is probably incorrect.

Option B: starts with tert-butyl, then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine). Then nitrate again. That seems odd, as adding nitro twice might not be the way.

Option C: starts with tert-butyl, then sulfonates, then nitrates. Hmm, sulfonate groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So, after adding the sulfonate, the next substitution (nitration) would be directed by the sulfonate group, perhaps in the meta position relative to it.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group, so perhaps option C is introducing it as an intermediate step, which would later be removed. But I don't see a step to remove the sulfonate group in option C. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Option A: starts with tert-butyl, then nitrates. Then, sulfonates. Then, diazotization steps, then H3O+/heat (possibly hydrolysis), then NaOH and EtBr (substitution?), Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then nitration again.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after making a diazonium salt. Let's think: after nitration, the ring has a nitro group. Then, sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) converts a primary amine to a diazonium salt, which can then be hydrolyzed.

Wait, perhaps in option A, after nitration, the nitro group is converted into an amine via Fe/HCl (but I'm not sure about that step). Then, diazotization would form a diazonium salt, which under certain conditions could be replaced by an ethoxide group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Add tert-butyl group: benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate: tert-butylbenzene â†’ tert-butyl- nitrobenzene. Wait, but where would the nitro group go? Depending on the directing effect of tert-butyl.

3. Sulfonate: add a sulfonic acid group. But again, target doesn't have it.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think about the correct order for substituents.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, numbering the benzene ring, position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. So, substituents are arranged in a row: 1, 2, 3.

So, perhaps the order of addition is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy and tert-butyl are added first in such a way that the next nitro group can be added in position 3.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification reaction, such as using an alkoxide. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution after converting a leaving group into a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the synthesis as follows:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation: benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Then, nitrate: nitro group is added in the ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution reaction directed by the nitro group (which is meta-directing).

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so adding another group might be difficult. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But again, the methods to add ethoxy are unclear.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the benzene ring needs to have strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro, to activate the ring towards nucleophilic attack.

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Nitrate benzene: benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

2. Convert nitro to amine: H2/Pd or Fe/HCl â†’ aniline.

3. Introduce ethoxy group via a substitution: make diazonium salt, then treat with ethanol.

Wait, that might work. Here's how:

- Benzene â†’ nitration â†’ nitrobenzene.

- Nitrobenzene â†’ reduction to aniline (Fe/HCl) â†’ aniline.

- Aniline â†’ diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) â†’ diazonium chloride.

- Diazonium chloride â†’ treated with ethanol under acidic conditions, perhaps heat, to substitute the amino group with ethoxy group. So, aniline â†’ ethoxybenzene.

Then, add the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring is activated with an ethoxy group (activating), so Friedel-Crafts should be possible.

So, after ethoxybenzene, add tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 â†’ ethoxy-tert-butylbenzene.

Then, nitrate to add nitro group. But where? The ethoxy group is an ortho/para director. The tert-butyl is also ortho/para. So, the nitro group would add in the meta position relative to one of them.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro group can be added in position 3.

Wait, but the ethoxy and tert-butyl are in positions 1 and 2, so the next substituent would be in position 3.

But how? Because after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two activating groups. The nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So, perhaps when adding nitro, it would be directed by the ethoxy group, which is a stronger activating group, so nitro would be added in the para position relative to ethoxy, which is position 4, not 3.

Hmm, that doesn't help. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which one makes sense.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 â†’ perhaps hydrolysis.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps it's the correct approach.

Wait, let's think about each step in option B.

1. Add tert-butyl: benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate: tert-butylbenzene â†’ tert-butyl-nitrobenzene. The nitro group would be at ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say it's at position 3.

3. Fe/HCl: nitro group â†’ amine. So, tert-butyl-aminobenzene.

4. Nitrate again: now, the ring has an amine (activating) and tert-butyl (activating). The nitro group would be added where? The amine is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, the new nitro group would be at ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group. So, this might not be correct.

Hmm, perhaps option B is not the right choice.

Another approach: think about the steps in option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine â†’ aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ tert-butylaniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again. Now, where would the nitro go? The ring has an amine (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, the new nitro group would go ortho or para to the amine.

But the target has only one nitro group, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Hmm. I'm not making progress quickly. Let me try to think of the correct order again.

The target has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy â†’ position 1.

2. Add tert-butyl â†’ position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Add nitro â†’ position 3 (meta to ethoxy, but how?)

Wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two activating groups. The next substitution, nitro, is deactivating and meta-directing. So, it would be directed by the strongest activating group, which is the ethoxy.

So, the nitro would be added in the meta position relative to ethoxy. If ethoxy is at position 1, the meta position would be position 4. But we need nitro at position 3. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group. If tert-butyl is at position 2, then meta would be position 5, which isn't the desired position.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl. Let me try.

1. Nitrate benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

2. Add ethoxy group via substitution. But how? Nitro is deactivating, so substitution would be difficult unless under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, the nitro group is converted into a leaving group, allowing substitution. For example, using a diazonium salt approach.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, reduce the nitro group to amine, then make a diazonium salt, then substitute with ethoxide.

So:

1. Benzene â†’ nitration â†’ nitrobenzene.

2. Nitro â†’ amine (Fe/HCl) â†’ aniline.

3. Aniline â†’ diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) â†’ diazonium chloride.

4. Diazonium chloride â†’ treated with ethanol to substitute the amino group with ethoxy â†’ ethoxybenzene.

5. Now, add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But, after adding ethoxy, the ring is activated, so Friedel-Crafts can proceed. The tert-butyl would add ortho or para to ethoxy.

But, in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2, adjacent to ethoxy at position 1. So, perhaps adding tert-butyl ortho to ethoxy.

Then, the third substituent, nitro, needs to be added. But wait, the nitro group was added first and then reduced. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to one of them.

Wait, but where would that be? If ethoxy is at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2, then adding nitro at position 3 (which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl) would require that the nitro group is directed by the ethoxy group.

But after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two activating groups. So, the next substitution would be influenced by the strongest director, which is the ethoxy group. So, nitro would be added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which is position 4, not 3.

Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have the nitro group added in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group. So, if tert-butyl is at position 2, the nitro would be at position 5. But that's not the target.

This is getting frustrating. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the options and see if any of them make sense.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate â†’ add sulfonic acid group.

But target doesn't have sulfonic acid. So, perhaps this is a protecting group or a directing group.

Then iii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe another hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution.

Hmm, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is used as a directing group for nitration, and then removed later. But I don't see a step to remove it, so maybe option C is incorrect.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride â†’ add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 â†’ nitrate.

iii) SO3 â†’ sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 â†’ diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O, Heat â†’ another hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction.

ix) HNO3 â†’ nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps the steps involve introducing a nitro group, then making a diazonium salt, substituting to get ethoxy, then adding another nitro group. But the target only has one nitro group, so maybe this is not correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is present. For example, if benzene has a nitro group, which can be converted into a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with a strong acid forms a benzylic carbocation, but I'm not sure if that would allow substitution with an ethoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a substitution reaction where the ring has a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl â†’ benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate â†’ tert-butyl-nitrobenzene.

3. Reduce nitro to amine â†’ tert-butyl-aniline.

4. Diazotize â†’ form diazonium salt.

5. Hydrolyze diazonium salt to form a ring with a hydroxyl group.

6. React with ethyl bromide in a substitution reaction (using NaOH) to introduce ethoxy group.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, and the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group and then is converted into a diazonium salt.

Wait, I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should think about the steps in each option and see which sequence leads to the correct substituents.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 â†’ nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+ â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution.

viii) SO3 â†’ sulfonate.

ix) H2SO4 â†’ maybe hydrolysis.

Hmm, perhaps this sequence adds two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have. So, option B is unlikely.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl â†’ add.

ii) sulfonate â†’ add.

iii) nitrate â†’ add nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro.

v) diazotization â†’ make diazonium salt.

vi) nitrate again â†’ add more nitro.

Hmm, again, multiple nitro groups, which the target doesn't have.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazotization.

v) hydrolysis.

vi) hydrolysis again.

vii) substitution.

viii) reduction.

ix) nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps this sequence adds the ethoxy group via substitution and then adds nitro again, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the target has 3 substituents, so perhaps each substitution is done in a specific order, each time introducing a new group that directs the next substitution.

Let me think about the correct order again. Let's say, add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, the ethoxy is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, but that would add an ethyl group, not ethoxy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl â†’ benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate â†’ tert-butyl-nitrobenzene. Nitro is at position 3? Or position 4?

3. Reduce nitro to amine â†’ tert-butyl-aniline.

4. Diazotize â†’ make diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxide â†’ tert-butyl-ethoxybenzene.

6. Nitrate again â†’ add nitro group.

But this would require adding nitro twice, which the target doesn't have.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, looking at the target structure, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. The order in which they are added must allow each new substituent to be directed correctly by the existing groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group ortho to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro group meta to ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

i) Add ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using ethyl chloride/AlCl3).

Wait, no, because that would add an ethyl group, not ethoxy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. Let me think.

1. Nitrate benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine â†’ aniline.

3. Diazotize â†’ diazonium chloride.

4. Substitute with EtO- (using NaOH and EtBr?) â†’ ethoxybenzene.

Then, add tert-butyl group â†’ ortho to ethoxy.

Finally, add nitro group meta to ethoxy.

But the target only has one nitro group. So, perhaps that's possible.

Wait, but the target has one nitro group. So, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be position 4. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Hmm, perhaps the order is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro group is added in a position influenced by both.

I'm really stuck here. I think I need to look at the options again.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 â†’ nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iii) AlCl3 and tert-butyl â†’ add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+ â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) H2SO4 â†’ ?

viii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution.

Hmm, perhaps this adds the ethoxy group via substitution after making a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

After adding nitro and reducing, then add tert-butyl. Then nitrate again. That may not fit.

I think I need to make a decision based on the options and the possible sequences.

The correct answer is likely option B or option C. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro substituents. Let's think about the positions.

Assuming the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy in the ortho position.

3. Add nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

But how to get nitro in position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

i) Add nitro.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Add tert-butyl.

iv) Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro group first.

2. Reduce nitro to amine.

3. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

4. Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

But after adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated, so the substitution would be directed by the amine group.

Hmm. Maybe this is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me look at it again.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl â†’ add.

ii) nitrate â†’ add nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ add another nitro group. But target has only one nitro.

So, perhaps option B is incorrect.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a leaving group, such as a nitro group. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize.

5. Substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, but this would require:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) reduce nitro to amine.

iv) diazotize.

v) substitute with ethoxy.

vi) add nitro again.

But the target has only one nitro group.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Based on the options, I think the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another angle: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The nitro group is a meta director. So, perhaps the nitro group is added last, when the ring has activating groups to direct it correctly.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after having a nitro group. Let me think.

1. Add tert-butyl â†’ benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate â†’ tert-butyl-nitrobenzene.

3. Reduce nitro to amine â†’ tert-butyl-aniline.

4. Diazotize â†’ diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxide â†’ tert-butyl-ethoxybenzene.

6. Now, add nitro group in the correct position.

But wait, that would require adding nitro group after substitution, but the target already has nitro.

Hmm. Not helpful.

I think I'm out of time. Based on the options, I think option B is the correct sequence.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that each substituent is added in the proper order to direct subsequent substitutions appropriately. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The directing effects of these groups and the activation/deactivation of the benzene ring are critical in determining the correct synthesis pathway.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Starts with the addition of the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution.  
   - The sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group (SO3/H2SO4), which is not part of the target molecule. This makes the sequence convoluted and unlikely to yield the desired product.

2. **Option B**:  
   - The sequence begins with the addition of the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration, reduction of the nitro group to an amine, nitration again, diazotization, hydrolysis, substitution, sulfonation, and hydrolysis.  
   - While the sequence introduces the tert-butyl and nitro groups, the repeated nitration and the introduction of a sulfonic acid group make this option inconsistent with the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:  
   - The sequence starts with the addition of the tert-butyl group, followed by sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration again, hydrolysis, and substitution.  
   - Similar to Option A, the introduction of a sulfonic acid group (SO3/H2SO4) is unnecessary and complicates the synthesis.

4. **Option D**:  
   - The sequence begins with nitration, reduction, addition of the tert-butyl group, nitration again, diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution.  
   - Adding the nitro group first deactivates the benzene ring, making subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (to add the tert-butyl group) difficult or unlikely to proceed efficiently. This makes the sequence chemically implausible.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target molecule. However, Option B appears to be the most plausible, as it introduces the tert-butyl and nitro groups in a manner that aligns with the directing effects of these substituents, even though it includes unnecessary steps like repeated nitration and sulfonation. Despite its complexity, Option B is selected as the best available choice.
