Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of measuring a certain observable, specifically the probability of getting 0 when I measure the system. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is represented as a column vector, and observables are represented by matrices. The observable here is given by matrix P, and the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). 

Wait, but wait a second— quantum states are usually supposed to be normalized. That means the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that. The state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. So the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, so it's not normalized. That might be important because probabilities depend on the norm.

But wait, when you measure an observable, you find the eigenvalues, and the probability is the squared magnitude of the component in that eigenstate. So maybe I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one corresponds to 0.

Wait, but P is the observable, so the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So I'm looking for the probability that the measurement yields 0, which would be the eigenvalue 0 of P. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down again:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm. So P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2   ]
[ 0        1/√2     0      ]

I need to find its eigenvalues. To find the eigenvalues, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's write P - λ I:

[ -λ      1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2    -λ       1/√2    ]
[ 0      1/√2     -λ      ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute the determinant.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Maybe expansion is easier here.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
 - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
 + 0 * [ ... ] (since the third column first element is zero, that term goes away).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute in another way. Alternatively, I can note that P is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues are real.

But maybe another approach. Let me think about the structure of P. It looks like a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal except for the center element. Wait, no, the diagonal elements are all zero except for the center? No, actually, the diagonal elements are all -λ in the matrix P - λ I. Wait, no, wait: P is as written, so P - λ I has 0-λ on the diagonal. So the diagonal is -λ, -λ, -λ.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

The determinant expansion:

|P - λ I| = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, let me write it more accurately. The determinant is calculated as:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

In our case, the matrix is:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

So a=-λ, b=1/√2, c=0
d=1/√2, e=-λ, f=1/√2
g=0, h=1/√2, i=-λ

So determinant = a*(e*i - f*h) - b*(d*i - f*g) + c*(d*h - e*g)

Let me compute each part.

First term: a*(e*i - f*h)
= (-λ) [ (-λ)*(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]
= (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -b*(d*i - f*g)
= -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
= -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ]
= -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2)
= (1/√2)(λ/√2)
= λ/(2)

Third term: c*(d*h - e*g)
= 0 * [ (1/√2)(1/√2) - (-λ)(0) ) ]
= 0

So overall determinant:
= (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

Let me compute that:
= -λ³ + (λ)(1/2) + λ/2
= -λ³ + (λ/2 + λ/2)
= -λ³ + λ

Set this equal to zero: -λ³ + λ = 0
Factor: λ(-λ² + 1) = 0
So λ = 0, or λ² =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So the possible measurement outcomes are -1, 0, 1.

But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 and compute the projection onto the state vector.

So first, let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We have (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the system is P |v> = 0. Let me write the equations.

Matrix P:
Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0] → 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] → (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0] → 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0

So the equations are:

1) (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

2) (1/√2)(v1 + v3 ) =0 → v1 + v3 =0.

3) (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

So from equation 1 and 3, v2 must be zero. Then from equation 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, v3]^T where v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but we can also write it as any scalar multiple, including normalization.

Wait, but we can choose v3 = -v1, so let's pick v1 =1, v3 = -1. So the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T.

But we need to normalize it because eigenvectors can be scaled. The norm is sqrt(1² +0² + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait, but let me double-check. The vector [1, 0, -1] has a squared length of 1+0+1=2, so the normalized vector is 1/sqrt(2) [1, 0, -1].

Okay, so the eigenvector for λ=0 is |ψ0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, the state of the system is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, this state is not normalized. So I should normalize it first, because probabilities depend on the inner product.

Wait, but the state vector is actually a state, and in quantum mechanics, it's supposed to be a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is not normalized. Let me compute its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But wait, the question says the state is (-1,2,1). So if I'm to compute probabilities, I need to make sure I use the normalized state. Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are calculated using the inner product with the eigenvectors.

Wait, so maybe the given state is not normalized. So I should normalize it before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ_normalized> and the eigenvector |ψ0>.

So compute the inner product:

⟨ψ0 | ψ_normalized⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]

Dot product:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ]

= (1/sqrt(12)) [ -2 ]

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )  [since sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3)]

= (-1)/sqrt(3)

Wait, the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/3) because | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 is 1/3.

Wait, but the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product. So |⟨ψ0 | ψ⟩|^2 is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Wait no, wait. Let me recheck that calculation.

Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by ( (-1) + 0 + (-1) ) → [ (-2) ].

So that is [1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))] * (-2) → sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) is sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So 1/(2*sqrt(3)) multiplied by (-2) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value is 1/sqrt(3), so the square is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the correct answer is C.

To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The matrix \( P - \lambda I \) is:

\[
P - \lambda I = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is computed as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left[ (-\lambda)(-\lambda) - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \right] - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-\lambda) - 0 \right] + 0.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left[ \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2}.
\]

Setting \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \):

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). The equations are:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_2 = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(v_1 + v_3) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_1 = -v_3 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_2 = 0 \).

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
|v\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Normalization
The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm is:

\[
\|\psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \|\psi\| = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left[ 1(-1) + 0(2) + (-1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-2) = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
