Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, relativistic effects might come into play, but I'm not entirely sure.

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. The options provided are A to D, each with different expressions.

Wait, so I need to find the speed of the light in the moving glass medium, as observed in the lab frame. I remember that the index of refraction affects the speed of light in a medium. The standard formula is v = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving, so that might complicate things.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity. Because the glass is moving, and the light is inside it, I need to consider how the velocities add up. But wait, the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. So the speed of the light relative to the lab frame isn't just v_light_in_medium plus the velocity of the medium, right? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula is for when you have two inertial frames moving relative to each other. So maybe I should think about this in terms of reference frames. Let's model it. Let's imagine a rest frame S (lab frame), and another frame S' that's moving at velocity v relative to S. In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving through it at speed v_light' = c/n. Then, I need to find the speed of this light in the lab frame S.

So, using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the lab frame, u' is the velocity in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but wait a second. The direction matters here. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the medium's frame (S'), the light is moving with velocity u' = c/n (since the medium is stationary, the speed is c/n). But wait, no, wait: the light is propagating through the glass which is moving. Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light in the lab frame. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving towards the observer. Let me get the directions right.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer with some speed. But the medium (glass) is moving in the same direction. So in the medium's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S), the light's speed is c/n.

Wait, no. Wait, the light propagates in the glass, so in S' (the glass's frame), the light is moving towards the observer at speed u' = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since S' is the glass's frame moving at v towards the observer), we have to apply the velocity transformation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify the frames. Let me set up the problem as such:

- Lab frame (S): the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity, towards the observer.

- Glass frame (S'): the glass is stationary. The light is moving through the glass at speed u' = c/n towards the observer.

Wait, but wait. If the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab frame, then in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving faster than the light, right? Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside it is moving at speed v_light = c/n. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame would be v_light = (v_glass + v_light_in_glass) / (1 + (v_glass * v_light_in_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait, that's the relativistic velocity addition formula. So yes, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²)

But I'm not sure if this applies here because the speed of light in the medium is c/n, which is less than c. So let's plug in the values.

In S', the light's speed is u' = c/n towards the observer. The medium (S') is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S), but wait, how? Because in the lab frame, the medium is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the velocity of S' relative to S is v. So when we apply the velocity addition formula, we have to make sure about the direction. If in S', the light is moving towards the observer (so in S', the observer is approaching the light, so the light's velocity is positive in the direction of motion? Or the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the direction as positive towards the observer. So in S', the light is moving towards the observer at u' = c/n. The medium is moving towards the observer at v in the lab frame. So from S' to S, the velocity transformation is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

So plugging in u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (1 + (v)/(n c) )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

The denominator is 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v ) / (n c )

So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate fractions:

Numerator becomes: (c + n v c) * c ? Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the numerator is (c/n + v). Let me express it as (c + n v ) / n.

The denominator is [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

So u is ( (c + n v ) / n ) divided by ( (n c + v ) / (n c) )

Which is equal to ( (c + n v ) / n ) * (n c) / (n c + v )

Simplify:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

(c + n v) is same as (n v + c)

Denominator is (n c + v) = v + n c. Hmm, same as (n c + v) or (v + n c).

Wait, the denominator is (n c + v) = same as (c n + v) ?

Wait, but (c + n v) is different from (n c + v). So in the numerator, (c + n v) is c plus n v, and the denominator is (n c + v), which is n c plus v.

So the expression becomes:

u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but that can be simplified. Let me factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's factor numerator: c (1 + n v / c )

Denominator: c (n + v / c )

So,

u = [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) ] * c / [ c (n + v / c ) ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, numerator: (c + n v) = c (1 + (n v)/c )

Denominator: (n c + v) = c (n + v/(c) )

So,

u = [ c(1 + (n v)/c ) * c ] / [ c (n + v/c) ) ]

Wait, why did I write the numerator as (c + n v) * c? Oh, no, wait, the numerator is (c + n v ), and the denominator is (n c + v ). So the prior expression for u was:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to (c + n v) * c / (n (n c + v)) )

Wait, that's not matching. Let me re-calculate.

Original u:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Let me compute denominator: 1 + ( (c v )/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = ( ( c + n v ) / n ) / ( (n c + v )/(n c) )

Because denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v )/(n c )

So, substituting that,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

Simplify:

The n in the numerator of the first fraction and denominator of the second will cancel.

So,

u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 1, which can't be because if v is not zero, the speed would be different. So probably not B.

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). Hmm, if I factor out c from numerator and denominator:

u = c (1 + (n v)/c ) / ( c (n + v / c ) )

So u = c * [ (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n + v/c ) ]

Let me denote beta as v/c, so beta = v/c.

Then,

u = c * [ (1 + n beta ) / (n + beta ) ]

Which is c*(1 + n beta)/(n + beta )

But wait, the options are given as fractions without c, because c=1. So in that case, the answer would be (1 + n v )/(n + v ), since c=1.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I have u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v ). Wait, wait, no, I think I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's re-express the problem.

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v ) / n

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c ) = (n c + v )/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is the same as [ (c + n v )/n ] * [ n c/(n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel, so:

= [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

But wait, the denominator here is n c + v, which is the same as v + n c.

So,

u = [ c (c + n v ) ] / (n c + v )

But if c=1, that's:

u = (1*(1 + n v )) / (n *1 + v ) = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this correct? Because when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame depends on the medium's speed. But according to the velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c, but that's only when light is moving in the same direction as the medium. But wait, no, the velocity addition formula gives the speed of light as c even when the medium is moving.

Wait, that can't be possible. Because in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So applying the velocity addition formula would give the lab frame speed as (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c²)) ) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)) )

Wait, but if I plug in c=1, then u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n) )

Which is same as ( (1 + n v ) /n ) / ( (n + v )/n )

The numerator is (1 +n v )/n, denominator (n + v)/n. So when you divide them, the n's cancel, giving (1 +n v)/(n +v ), same as before.

But wait, according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame should be c. But according to this calculation, it's (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is less than c when v is positive?

Wait, no, let's test with some numbers. Let's say n=1 (so it's vacuum), and v is some velocity, say v=0.5 (so v=0.5 c since c=1).

Then, according to our formula, u=(1+1*0.5)/(1+0.5) = (1.5)/(1.5)=1. So that's c, as expected. Because in a vacuum, light speed is c regardless of the medium's motion.

Another test case: n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(1 + 2*0.5)/(2+0.5) = (1+1)/(2.5)=2/2.5=0.8. Which is less than c=1, but n=2, so in the medium, light speed is 0.5, but with medium moving at 0.5c towards observer, the observed speed would be 0.8c, which is more than 0.5c. That makes sense, because the medium is moving towards us, so the light's speed as observed is higher than in the medium.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light shouldn't be more than c. But in this case, 0.8 <1, so it's okay.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when the medium is moving, the observed speed of light is (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is less than c if n and v are positive.

Wait, but in the case where n=1, the speed is c, as expected.

So, the formula seems to hold. So the answer should be option A: (1 +n v )/(n +v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which matches our result.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the lab frame, and the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's rest frame) is \( c/n \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The goal is to find the speed of light in the lab frame.

### Key Equations and Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**:  
   The speed of light in the lab frame \( u \) is given by:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   where \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab, and \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem).

2. **Substitute \( u' = c/n \) into the Formula**:  
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the equation:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Simplify the denominator:  
   \[
   1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
   \]  
   Thus, the equation becomes:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Expression**:  
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to eliminate fractions:  
   \[
   u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
   \]  

4. **Final Expression**:  
   Since \( c = 1 \), the speed of light in the lab frame simplifies to:  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]  

### Verification:
- **Case 1**: If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the formula reduces to \( u = \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which matches the relativistic result that light speed remains \( c \) in a vacuum.
- **Case 2**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \), the formula gives \( u = \frac{1 + 2(0.5)}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is consistent with expectations.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, relativistic effects might come into play, but I'm not entirely sure.

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity. Because the glass is moving, and the light is inside it, I need to consider how the velocities add up. But wait, the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. So the speed of the light relative to the lab frame isn't just v_light_in_medium plus the velocity of the medium, right? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula is for when you have two inertial frames moving relative to each other. So maybe I should think about this in terms of reference frames. Let's model it. Let's imagine a rest frame S (lab frame), and another frame S' that's moving at velocity v relative to S. In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving through it at speed v_light' = c/n. Then, I need to find the speed of this light in the lab frame S.

So, using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the lab frame, u' is the velocity in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but wait a second. The direction matters here. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the medium's frame (S'), the light is moving with velocity u' = c/n (since the medium is stationary, the speed is c/n). But wait, no, wait: the light is propagating through the glass which is moving. Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light in the lab frame. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving towards the observer. Let me get the directions right.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer with some speed. But the medium (glass) is moving in the same direction. So in the medium's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S), the light's speed is c/n.

Wait, no. Wait, the light propagates in the glass, so in S' (the glass's frame), the light is moving towards the observer at speed u' = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since S' is the glass's frame moving at v towards the observer), we have to apply the velocity transformation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify the frames. Let me set up the problem as such:

- Lab frame (S): the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity, towards the observer.

- Glass frame (S'): the glass is stationary. The light is moving through the glass at speed u' = c/n towards the observer.

Wait, but wait. If the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab frame, then in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving faster than the light, right? Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside it is moving at speed v_light = c/n. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame would be v_light = (v_glass + v_light_in_glass) / (1 + (v_glass * v_light_in_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait, that's the relativistic velocity addition formula. So yes, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²)

But I'm not sure if this applies here because the speed of light in the medium is c/n, which is less than c. So let's plug in the values.

In S', the light's speed is u' = c/n towards the observer. The medium (S') is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S), but wait, how? Because in the lab frame, the medium is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the velocity of S' relative to S is v. So when we apply the velocity addition formula, we have to make sure about the direction. If in S', the light is moving towards the observer (so in S', the observer is approaching the light, so the light's velocity is positive in the direction of motion? Or the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the direction as positive towards the observer. So in S', the light is moving towards the observer at u' = c/n. The medium is moving towards the observer at v in the lab frame. So from S' to S, the velocity transformation is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

So plugging in u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (1 + (v)/(n c) )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

The denominator is 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v ) / (n c )

So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate fractions:

Numerator becomes: (c + n v c) * c ? Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the numerator is (c/n + v). Let me express it as (c + n v ) / n.

The denominator is [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

So u is ( (c + n v ) / n ) divided by ( (n c + v ) / (n c) )

Which is equal to ( (c + n v ) / n ) * (n c) / (n c + v )

Simplify:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

(c + n v) is same as (n v + c)

Denominator is (n c + v) = v + n c. Hmm, same as (n c + v) or (v + n c).

Wait, the denominator is (n c + v) = same as (c n + v) ?

Wait, but (c + n v) is different from (n c + v). So in the numerator, (c + n v) is c plus n v, and the denominator is (n c + v), which is n c plus v.

So the expression becomes:

u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but that can be simplified. Let me factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's factor numerator: c (1 + n v / c )

Denominator: c (n + v / c )

So,

u = [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) ] * c / [ c (n + v / c ) ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, numerator: (c + n v) = c (1 + (n v)/c )

Denominator: (n c + v) = c (n + v/(c) )

So,

u = [ c(1 + (n v)/c ) * c ] / [ c (n + v/c) ) ]

Wait, why did I write the numerator as (c + n v) * c? Oh, no, wait, the numerator is (c + n v ), and the denominator is (n c + v ). So the prior expression for u was:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to (c + n v) * c / (n (n c + v)) )

Wait, that's not matching. Let me re-calculate.

Original u:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Let me compute denominator: 1 + ( (c v )/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = ( ( c + n v ) / n ) / ( (n c + v )/(n c) )

Because denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v )/(n c )

So, substituting that,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

Simplify:

The n in the numerator of the first fraction and denominator of the second will cancel.

So,

u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 1, which can't be because if v is not zero, the speed would be different. So probably not B.

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). Hmm, if I factor out c from numerator and denominator:

u = c (1 + (n v)/c ) / ( c (n + v / c ) )

So u = c * [ (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n + v/c ) ]

Let me denote beta as v/c, so beta = v/c.

Then,

u = c * [ (1 + n beta ) / (n + beta ) ]

Which is c*(1 + n beta)/(n + beta )

But wait, the options are given as fractions without c, because c=1. So in that case, the answer would be (1 + n v )/(n + v ), since c=1.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I have u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v ). Wait, wait, no, I think I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's re-express the problem.

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v ) / n

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c ) = (n c + v )/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is the same as [ (c + n v )/n ] * [ n c/(n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel, so:

= [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

But wait, the denominator here is n c + v, which is the same as v + n c.

So,

u = [ c (c + n v ) ] / (n c + v )

But if c=1, that's:

u = (1*(1 + n v )) / (n *1 + v ) = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this correct? Because when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame depends on the medium's speed. But according to the velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c, but that's only when light is moving in the same direction as the medium. But wait, no, the velocity addition formula gives the speed of light as c even when the medium is moving.

Wait, that can't be possible. Because in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So applying the velocity addition formula would give the lab frame speed as (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c²)) ) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)) )

Wait, but if I plug in c=1, then u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n) )

Which is same as ( (1 + n v ) /n ) / ( (n + v )/n )

The numerator is (1 +n v )/n, denominator (n + v)/n. So when you divide them, the n's cancel, giving (1 +n v)/(n +v ), same as before.

But wait, according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame should be c. But according to this calculation, it's (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is less than c when v is positive?

Wait, no, let's test with some numbers. Let's say n=1 (so it's vacuum), and v is some velocity, say v=0.5 (so v=0.5 c since c=1).

Then, according to our formula, u=(1+1*0.5)/(1+0.5) = (1.5)/(1.5)=1. So that's c, as expected. Because in a vacuum, light speed is c regardless of the medium's motion.

Another test case: n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(1 + 2*0.5)/(2+0.5) = (1+1)/(2.5)=2/2.5=0.8. Which is less than c=1, but n=2, so in the medium, light speed is 0.5, but with medium moving at 0.5c towards observer, the observed speed would be 0.8c, which is more than 0.5c. That makes sense, because the medium is moving towards us, so the light's speed as observed is higher than in the medium.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light shouldn't be more than c. But in this case, 0.8 <1, so it's okay.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when the medium is moving, the observed speed of light is (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is less than c if n and v are positive.

Wait, but in the case where n=1, the speed is c, as expected.

So, the formula seems to hold. So the answer should be option A: (1 +n v )/(n +v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which matches our result.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the lab frame, and the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's rest frame) is \( c/n \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The goal is to find the speed of light in the lab frame.

### Key Equations and Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**:  
   The speed of light in the lab frame \( u \) is given by:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   where \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab, and \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem).

2. **Substitute \( u' = c/n \) into the Formula**:  
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the equation:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Simplify the denominator:  
   \[
   1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
   \]  
   Thus, the equation becomes:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Expression**:  
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to eliminate fractions:  
   \[
   u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
   \]  

4. **Final Expression**:  
   Since \( c = 1 \), the speed of light in the lab frame simplifies to:  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]  

### Verification:
- **Case 1**: If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the formula reduces to \( u = \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which matches the relativistic result that light speed remains \( c \) in a vacuum.
- **Case 2**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \), the formula gives \( u = \frac{1 + 2(0.5)}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is consistent with expectations.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
