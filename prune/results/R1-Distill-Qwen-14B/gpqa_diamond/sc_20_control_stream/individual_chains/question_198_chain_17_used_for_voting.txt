Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Hmm. The problem gives me the concentrations of Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, along with some stability constants for the complexes. 

Wait, the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) and SCN- ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex forms. The complexes here are Co(SCN)n^2-n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, but what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? Oh, right, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 or something like that. Wait, wait, the charge on Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for two SCN, the complex would have a charge of Co^2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex is neutral. But I'm not sure about the exact structure, but maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the question is about [Co(SCN)_2]²+? Or maybe that's not right. Wait, no: Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for n=2, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, but the options don't specify that. The question says "blue dithiocyanato", which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is blue.

So, the problem is to find the mole fraction or percentage of this dithiocyanato complex in the solution. The total cobalt concentration includes all forms: free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

The approach I think is to use the formation constants to calculate the distribution of each species. The formation constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So βn is the stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, but what's the order? Usually, β1 is for the first complex, like [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on. So β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but wait, β is the formation constant. For example, β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9. Similarly, β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)=40. And so on.

But the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β for each successive complex increases or decreases. Hmm, β3 is the largest, which suggests that the third complex is the most stable. But wait, the question is about the second complex. So in this case, the species with n=2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has β2=40.

Now, to find the percentage of this species, we need to consider the distribution of all possible complexes and the free ion.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each species, considering their stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

But wait, the total concentration of cobalt is given as c(Co) =1e-2 M. This includes all species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So, the sum of all these concentrations is 1e-2 M.

But how to calculate the fraction of each?

I think the way to approach this is to set up the expressions for each complex. Let me denote:

Let x be the concentration of free Co^2+.

Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] 

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2 

[Co(SCN)_3]^− = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3 

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4 

But wait, I think that's not quite right. Because the formation constants are cumulative. So, for each subsequent complex, the formation constant is the product of adding another ligand.

Wait, no, the βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, the expression for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but that's correct. So, for each species, the concentration is βn * x * (s)^n, where s is the concentration of SCN^-.

But wait, but the problem is that we have multiple complexes, so the sum of all species (including free Co^2+) is the total cobalt concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So: x + β1 x s + β2 x s^2 + β3 x s^3 + β4 x s^4 = c = 1e-2.

But wait, let me write s as the concentration of SCN^- which is given as 0.1 M.

So s = 0.1.

Let me compute each term.

Compute each term step by step:

x is the [Co^2+].

Term1: x → x.

Term2: β1 x s → 9 x * 0.1 → 0.9 x.

Term3: β2 x s² →40 x (0.1)^2 →40 x *0.01=0.4 x.

Term4: β3 x s^3 →63 x (0.1)^3 →63 * 0.001 x →0.063 x.

Term5: β4 x s^4 →16 x (0.1)^4 →16 * 0.0001 x →0.0016 x.

So the sum of all terms is x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) ) = x * (1 + 0.9 is 1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 is 2.363, plus 0.0016 is 2.3646).

So sum = x * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004226 M.

Wait, that's [Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.004226 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 * 0.004226 ≈ 0.003803 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 0.4 x ≈ 0.4 * 0.004226 ≈ 0.001690 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^− = 0.063 x ≈ 0.063 * 0.004226 ≈ 0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 0.0016 x ≈ 0.0016 * 0.004226 ≈ 0.00000676 M.

Wait a minute, so the total is x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x ≈ 2.3646 x = 1e-2, which matches.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So its concentration is 0.001690 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So the mole fraction is 0.001690 / 0.01 → 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So D is 16.9%.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the calculation for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β2 x s² =40 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 * x *0.01=0.4 x.

x is 0.004226, so 0.4 * 0.004226 = 0.0016904, which is right.

So the percentage is (0.0016904 / 0.01) *100 =16.904%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, is there something I'm missing? Let me think again. Are the stability constants correctly applied? Because sometimes, the formation constant is defined as βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So that would be correct as applied.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is different because the given β's are not the formation constants but the sequential constants. Wait, no, the problem states they are the stability constants, which are the overall formation constants.

So the approach seems correct. The percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16), the total cobalt concentration \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

The total cobalt concentration includes all species: free Co²⁺, [CoSCN]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The concentrations of these species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration \( x = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \) and the stability constants as:

\[
[\text{CoSCN}]^+ = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-], \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^- = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4.
\]

The total cobalt concentration is given by:

\[
x + \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2}.
\]

Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) and the stability constants:

\[
x + 9x(0.1) + 40x(0.1)^2 + 63x(0.1)^3 + 16x(0.1)^4 = 10^{-2}.
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 10^{-2}.
\]

Combine terms:

\[
x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 10^{-2}.
\]

\[
x(2.3646) = 10^{-2}.
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004226 \, \text{M}.
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot 0.01 = 0.0016904 \, \text{M}.
\]

The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.0016904}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
