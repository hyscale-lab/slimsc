Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But since one of the objects is a conducting sphere, which is grounded, that complicates things a bit. Oh right, a grounded conductor allows charges to flow in or out, so the potential on the surface of the conductor (sphere) is zero.

So, when charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere being a conductor will have induced charges. The conducting sphere will have an induced charge opposite to q on its near side and an induced charge equal to +q on the far side? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Since the sphere is grounded, charges can leave or enter the earth. So when a positive charge q is placed near the sphere, the electrons in the sphere will be attracted to the near side, making that side negative. But since the sphere is a conductor, the charges redistribute until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But because it's grounded, the sphere can lose electrons or gain them as needed.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the sphere as having an induced charge. Let me think: when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. Since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which affects the distribution of induced charges.

Wait, but wait, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero because it's grounded. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere must sum to zero on the sphere's surface.

Hmm, I think the method is to find the image charge. Because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the problem can be modeled using the method of images. In the method of images, when you have a charge near a conducting sphere, you can replace the sphere with an image charge such that the potential is the same as the original setup.

Wait, the image charge concept. So for a conducting sphere of radius R, when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center, the image charge q' would be inside the sphere. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me recall. For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge is located along the line connecting the charge and the center of the sphere. The image charge q' is given by q' = - (R² / (d² - R²))^(1/2) q? Or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think about the image charge formula.

Wait, the image charge for a conducting sphere is given by q' = (R² / (d² - R²))^(-1/2) * q? Or perhaps it's q' = R²/(d² - R²) * something. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of potential. The sphere being grounded means that its potential is zero, so the potential due to q and the induced charges must sum to zero on the sphere's surface.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the potential energy by considering the work done in assembling the charges. But how?

Wait, another approach. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Here, the system includes the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges are such that the potential inside the conductor is zero. Wait, no, the potential inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is uniform, but for a grounded conductor, it's the same as the ground, which is taken as zero.

So, when q is placed outside the sphere, the sphere's induced charge will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Let's model the induced charge as a point charge located at the center of the sphere, because the induced charges will arrange themselves symmetrically.

Wait, I think the effective charge on the sphere is such that the potential at the surface (radius R) due to q and the induced charge is zero. Suppose the sphere ends up with an induced charge q'. Then the potential at the surface due to q and q' must be zero.

Wait, no, actually. Since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges are on the surface. So the potential on the sphere's surface is the sum of potentials due to charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges have a certain distribution. But perhaps using the method of images, we can model this as if the sphere is replaced by an image charge inside it.

Wait, the method of images says that the potential outside the sphere due to the charge q and the sphere can be represented as the potential due to charge q and an image charge q' inside the sphere. So, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the potential outside is the same as with the image charge.

Wait, wait, the image charge concept: For a point charge outside a conducting sphere (radius R), the image charge q' is located at a point along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge q. The image charge's position and magnitude are such that the potential due to q and q' at any point outside the sphere is the same as the potential due to q and the induced charges on the sphere.

The formula for the image charge q' is given by q' = (R^3 / (d^2 - R^2)) q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the image charge is located a distance d’ from the center where d’ = R² / d. Wait, let me think. The image charge is placed such that the potential at the surface of the sphere is zero. So, in the image method, the sphere is considered as having a charge q' which is inside, and the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface must be zero.

So, the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq / (d), since the distance from q to the surface is d (wait, no: if the center is at distance d, then the distance from q to the surface is d - R when on the same line). Wait, no, if the charge q is at a distance d from the center, then the distance from q to the surface is (d - R) on the near side (if d > R) and (d + R) on the far side. Hmm, but the sphere is symmetric, so perhaps the image charge is located at a point such that the distance from the image to the center is R²/d. So the image charge is at a distance d' = R²/d from the center, but on the opposite side of the sphere relative to q.

Wait, this is getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The image charge method says that the potential inside the conductor is zero, so the image charge is placed in such a way that the potential at the sphere's surface due to the image charge is equal and opposite to that due to q. So, the potential due to the image charge q’ at the surface must be equal to minus the potential due to q.

So, the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq / (d - R) on the near side, but wait, no. Wait, the distance from q to the surface is (d - R) if it's placed outside (d > R). Wait, no, no, if the charge is at distance d from the center of the sphere, then the distance from q to the surface is d - R if it's on the same line. So the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq/(d - R).

The potential at the surface due to the image charge q’ should be V’ = k q’ / (d’ ), where d’ is the distance from the image charge to the surface. Since the image charge is inside the sphere, and located along the line from q to the center, the image charge's distance from the center is R²/d.

Wait, so if the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center, then the distance from the image charge to the surface on that same line would be R – (R²/d) = R (1 – R/d) = R (d - R)/d. So, the distance from q’ to the surface is R (d - R)/d.

Wait, but the potential due to q’ at the surface needs to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to V1. So,

V1 + V’ = 0 → kq/(d - R) + k q’ / [ R (d - R)/d ] = 0

Simplify:

kq/(d - R) = - k q’ [ d/( R (d - R) ) ]

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q = -k q’ [ d / R ]

Divide both sides by k:

q = - (d/R) q’

→ q’ = - (R/d) q.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the distance. The image charge is placed inside the sphere at a distance x from the center, on the same line as q. The potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq/(d - R), because the distance between q and the surface is d - R. The potential at the surface due to q’ is V2 = k q’ / (R - x), because the image charge is at a distance x from the center, and the surface is at distance R, so from q’ to the surface is (R - x) if x < R (which it is, since the image is inside the sphere).

Wait, but wait, the image charge is at a distance x from the center, so the distance from q’ to the surface is (R - x) on the same side as q. Because q is outside, the image is inside, so the distance from q’ to the surface is R - x.

Wait, but the condition is that V1 + V2 = 0, so:

k q / (d - R) + k q’/(R - x ) = 0.

Also, from the image charge method, the distance x is given by x = R^2/d, because the product of the distances from the image and the original charge to the center is R^2. So d * x = R^2 → x = R²/d.

So substituting x = R²/d into the equation:

k q/(d - R) + k q’/( R - (R²/d) ) = 0.

Simplify the denominator in the second term:

R - (R²/d) = R(1 - R/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So,

kq/(d - R) + k q’ [d/( R (d - R) ) ] = 0.

Multiply both terms by (d - R):

k q + k q’ [ d/( R ) ] = 0.

Divide both sides by k:

q + ( q’ d ) / R = 0 → q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

So the image charge is q’ = - (R q)/d.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me see, if the charge q is placed at distance d from the center, then the image charge is q’ = - (R^2 / d^2) q? No, wait, I thought the standard formula for image charge for a sphere is q’ = (R³ / d² ) q, but maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the formula for image charge. The standard image charge method for a sphere with radius R when a charge Q is placed at a distance d from the center (d > R) is that the image charge is located at a distance d’ = R²/d from the center, and the image charge q’ is given by q’ = - ( R² / d ) Q. Hmm, no, that can’t be right because units would be off.

Wait, let me think again. The image charge is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_q’ = 0.

V_sphere at the surface due to q is k q / (d - R).

V_sphere due to q’ is k q’ / ( R – x ), where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. We have that x = R² / d.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k q’/( R – x ) = 0.

Substituting x = R²/d:

R – x = R – (R²/d) = R (d – R)/d.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k q’ * [ d / ( R (d – R) ) ) ] = 0.

Factoring out k/(d – R):

k/(d – R) [ q + q’ d/(R) ] = 0.

Which leads to:

q + ( q’ d )/( R ) = 0 → q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

So the image charge is q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

Wait, but that seems a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up something else. Let me check with another approach.

Another way: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere into their final positions. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can flow in or out, so the potential on the sphere is zero.

The potential energy U of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, plus the work done to bring the induced charges into their positions on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any work done in redistributing the charges on the sphere would relate to the potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy can be found by considering the interaction between the charge q and the image charge. Because the image charge is inside the sphere, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between q and the image charge.

Wait, let me think. The system is charge q and the conducting sphere. The sphere can be replaced by the image charge q’ inside it, so the potential energy between q and q’ is the same as the potential energy of the system.

So the potential energy U is given by the formula:

U = k ( q q’ ) / r,

where r is the distance between q and q’.

Wait, but wait, in the image method, the system is modeled as if the conducting sphere is replaced by the image charge. So the potential energy between q and the induced charges on the sphere is the same as the potential energy between q and the image charge.

So, U is the potential energy between q and q’:

U = k ( q q’ ) / (d),

since the distance between q and q’ is d – x, where x is the position of the image charge. Wait, no. Let's see, q is at a distance d from the center, and the image charge q’ is at a distance x = R²/d from the center on the opposite side. So the distance between q and q’ is d – x (if they are on the same line), which is d – (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U is:

U = k * q * q’ / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= k q q’ d / (d² - R²)

But we found earlier that q’ = - R q / d.

Substituting q’:

U = k q * (- R q / d ) * d / (d² - R² )

Simplify:

The d's cancel:

U = - k R q² / (d² - R² )

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²)
Option B: U= -k q² d/(d² - R²)
Option C: U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)
Option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R^2)

Hmm, none of these match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charges.

Wait, another approach. The potential energy of a system of two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, the sphere's induced charge is equivalent to an image charge q’ which is inside. So the potential energy is between q and q’. But earlier calculation gave U = -k R q²/(d² - R²). But none of the options match this. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting a factor of 1/2. Because when you bring in two charges, you might have to account for the work done in bringing each charge in, which could involve a 1/2 factor. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy includes the self-energy of the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another way: The potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the induced charges are -q_induced and +q_induced, but perhaps the net effect is that the potential energy is the same as if the sphere were replaced by the image charge, and the system's energy is the energy between q and q’. But in that case, the energy is U = k ( q q’ ) / r, where r is the separation between q and q’.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the induced charges on the sphere have their own potential energy. But the sphere is conducting, so the work done in redistributing charges on a conductor is related to the potential. But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero, which might affect the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) * k q q’ / r, because when you bring two charges together, the potential energy is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. Hmm, that might be it. So let me recalculate.

If U is the potential energy between q and q’, then U = (1/2) k ( q q’ ) / r.

Wait, why 1/2? Because when you assemble the system, each charge is brought in from infinity, and the potential energy involves the product of the charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy stored in the configuration is the same as the energy of the image charge configuration. So maybe the potential energy is (1/2) k ( q q’ ) / r.

Wait, but in the image method, the potential outside the sphere due to the charge and the sphere is the same as the potential due to the image charge. So the potential energy would be like the energy of the image charge and the original charge. So:

U = k ( q q’ ) / r,

where r is the distance between q and q’.

In our previous calculation, r = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, let's compute that again. The distance between q and q’ is d minus x, where x is the position of q’ from the center. Since q’ is inside the sphere, the distance from the center to q’ is R²/d. So the distance between q and q’ is d – (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = k q q’ / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k q q’ d / (d² - R²)

Earlier, I found q’ = - (R q ) / d.

Substituting q’:

U = k * q * (- R q/d ) * d / (d² - R² )

Simplify:

The d in the numerator and denominator cancels.

U = - k R q² / (d² - R² )

But looking at the options, none have just R in the numerator. Let me check the options again.

Option A: - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²) → denominator has (d² + R²)

Option B: - k q² d/(d² - R²)

Hmm, that's different. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the image charge.

Let me think again about the image charge. Maybe the image charge is not q’ = - R q / d. Let me re-derive it.

The potential at the surface of the sphere must be zero. So,

V_surface = V_q + V_q’ = 0.

V_q is the potential at surface due to charge q: V_q = k q / (d - R).

V_q’ is the potential at surface due to image charge q’ located at x from center, along the same line. The distance from q’ to the surface is (R - x) on the same side as q.

So,

V_q + V_q’ = 0 → k q/(d - R) + k q’/(R - x ) = 0.

We also have the condition from the image method that x = R²/d.

So,

R - x = R - R²/d = R (1 - R/d) = R (d - R ) / d.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k q’ [ d/( R (d - R) ) ) ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + k q’ [ d/( R ) ] = 0.

Divide by k:

q + ( q’ d ) / R = 0 → q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

Same result as before.

So the image charge is q' = - R q/d.

So the potential energy U is the potential energy between q and q’:

U = k ( q q’ ) / r,

where r is the distance between them, which is d – x = d – (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = k * q * (- R q / d ) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k * (- R q²/d ) * ( d ) / (d² - R² )

= - k R q² / (d² - R^2 )

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought. The potential energy of the system is not just between q and q’, but also includes the self-energy of the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the self-energy might be zero. Or perhaps it's already accounted for in the image charge method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the work done in assembling the system, which includes the work done in bringing charge q to its position and the work done in redistributing the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U can be calculated as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere.

But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The work done in bringing charge q would be q times the potential at its position due to the sphere.

Wait, but when bringing in q, the sphere has induced charges. The potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere, which, since the sphere is grounded and is a conductor, would have zero potential on its surface. But point charges outside the sphere would contribute to the potential at q's position.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated. Let me think of the system as consisting of two charges: q and the image charge q’. The potential energy is the energy of their interaction, which is (1/2) k q q’ / r, because when you bring two charges together, the potential energy is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r.

So, U = (1/2) k ( q q’ ) / r.

With q’ = - (R q)/d,

r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k [ q (- R q/d ) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= (1/2) k [ - R q² / d ] * [ d/(d² - R²) )

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * (- R q² ) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k R q² / (d² - R² )

Hmm, that's option D:

Option D: U= - (1/2) *k q^2 R/(d^2 -R^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To calculate the net potential energy of the system consisting of a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere ensures that its surface potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere.

### Key Steps:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge \( q \). Its magnitude is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{R q}{d}.
   \]
   The image charge is positioned at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere.

2. **Distance Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is:
   \[
   r = d - x = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the potential energy between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). Using the formula for the potential energy between two charges:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{r}.
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R q}{d} \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \):
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R q}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option D**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through it step by step.

So, in the image method, the sphere is considered as having a charge q' which is inside, and the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface must be zero.

So, the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq / (d), since the distance from q to the surface is d (wait, no: if the center is at distance d, then the distance from q to the surface is d - R when on the same line). Wait, no, if the charge q is at a distance d from the center, then the distance from q to the surface is (d - R) on the near side (if d > R) and (d + R) on the far side. Hmm, but the sphere is symmetric, so perhaps the image charge is located at a point such that the distance from the image to the center is R²/d. So the image charge is at a distance d' = R²/d from the center, but on the opposite side of the sphere relative to q.

Wait, this is getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The image charge method says that the potential inside the conductor is zero, so the image charge is placed in such a way that the potential at the sphere's surface due to the image charge is equal and opposite to that due to q. So, the potential due to the image charge q’ at the surface must be equal to minus the potential due to q.

So, the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq / (d - R) on the near side, but wait, no. Wait, the distance from q to the surface is (d - R) if it's placed outside (d > R). Wait, no, no, if the charge is at distance d from the center of the sphere, then the distance from q to the surface is d - R if it's on the same line. So the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq/(d - R).

The potential at the surface due to the image charge q’ should be V’ = k q’ / (d’ ), where d’ is the distance from the image charge to the surface. Since the image charge is inside the sphere, and located along the line from q to the center, the image charge's distance from the center is R²/d.

Wait, so if the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center, then the distance from the image charge to the surface on that same line would be R – (R²/d) = R (1 – R/d) = R (d - R)/d. So, the distance from q’ to the surface is R (d - R)/d.

Wait, but the potential due to q’ at the surface needs to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to V1. So,

V1 + V’ = 0 → kq/(d - R) + k q’ / [ R (d - R)/d ] = 0

Simplify:

kq/(d - R) = - k q’ [ d/( R (d - R) ) ]

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q = -k q’ [ d / R ]

Divide both sides by k:

q = - (d/R) q’

→ q’ = - (R/d) q.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the distance. The image charge is placed inside the sphere at a distance x from the center, on the same line as q. The potential at the surface due to q is V1 = kq/(d - R), because the distance between q and the surface is d - R. The potential at the surface due to q’ is V2 = k q’ / (R - x), because the image charge is at a distance x from the center, and the surface is at distance R, so from q’ to the surface is (R - x) if x < R (which it is, since the image is inside the sphere).

Wait, but wait, the image charge is at a distance x from the center, so the distance from q’ to the surface is (R - x) on the same side as q. Because q is outside, the image is inside, so the distance from q’ to the surface is R - x.

Wait, but the condition is that V1 + V2 = 0, so:

k q / (d - R) + k q’/(R - x ) = 0.

Also, from the image charge method, the distance x is given by x = R^2/d, because the product of the distances from the image and the original charge to the center is R^2. So d * x = R^2 → x = R²/d.

So substituting x = R²/d into the equation:

k q/(d - R) + k q’/( R - (R²/d) ) = 0.

Simplify the denominator in the second term:

R - (R²/d) = R(1 - R/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So,

kq/(d - R) + k q’ [d/( R (d - R) ) ] = 0.

Multiply both terms by (d - R):

k q + k q’ [ d/( R ) ] = 0.

Divide both sides by k:

q + ( q’ d ) / R = 0 → q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

So the image charge is q’ = - (R q)/d.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me see, if the charge q is placed at distance d from the center, then the image charge is q’ = - (R^2 / d^2) q? No, wait, I thought the standard formula for image charge for a sphere is q’ = (R³ / d² ) q, but maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the formula for image charge. The standard image charge method for a sphere with radius R when a charge Q is placed at a distance d from the center (d > R) is that the image charge is located at a distance d’ = R²/d from the center, and the image charge q’ is given by q’ = - ( R² / d ) Q. Hmm, no, that can’t be right because units would be off.

Wait, let me think again. The image charge is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_q’ = 0.

V_sphere at the surface due to q is k q / (d - R).

V_sphere due to q’ is k q’ / ( R – x ), where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. We have that x = R² / d.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k q’/( R – x ) = 0.

Substituting x = R²/d:

R – x = R – (R²/d) = R (d – R)/d.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k q’ * [ d / ( R (d – R) ) ) ] = 0.

Factoring out k/(d – R):

k/(d – R) [ q + q’ d/(R) ] = 0.

Which leads to:

q + ( q’ d )/( R ) = 0 → q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

So the image charge is q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

Wait, but that seems a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up something else. Let me check with another approach.

Another way: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere into their final positions. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can flow in or out, so the potential on the sphere is zero.

The potential energy U of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, plus the work done to bring the induced charges into their positions on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any work done in redistributing the charges on the sphere would relate to the potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy can be found by considering the interaction between the charge q and the image charge. Because the image charge is inside the sphere, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between q and the image charge.

Wait, let me think. The system is charge q and the conducting sphere. The sphere can be replaced by the image charge q’ inside it, so the potential energy between q and q’ is the same as the potential energy of the system.

So the potential energy U is given by the formula:

U = k ( q q’ ) / r,

where r is the distance between q and q’.

Wait, but wait, in the image method, the system is modeled as if the conducting sphere is replaced by the image charge. So the potential energy between q and the induced charges on the sphere is the same as the potential energy between q and the image charge.

So, U is the potential energy between q and q’:

U = k ( q q’ ) / (d),

since the distance between q and q’ is d – x, where x is the position of the image charge. Wait, no. Let's see, q is at a distance d from the center, and the image charge q’ is at a distance x = R²/d from the center on the opposite side. So the distance between q and q’ is d – x (if they are on the same line), which is d – (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U is:

U = k * q * q’ / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= k q q’ d / (d² - R²)

But we found earlier that q’ = - R q / d.

Substituting q’:

U = k q * (- R q / d ) * d / (d² - R² )

Simplify:

The d's cancel:

U = - k R q² / (d² - R² )

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²)
Option B: U= -k q² d/(d² - R²)
Option C: U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)
Option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R^2)

Hmm, none of these match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charges.

Wait, another approach. The potential energy of a system of two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, the sphere's induced charge is equivalent to an image charge q’ which is inside. So the potential energy is between q and q’. But earlier calculation gave U = -k R q²/(d² - R²). But none of the options match this. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting a factor of 1/2. Because when you bring in two charges, you might have to account for the work done in bringing each charge in, which could involve a 1/2 factor. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy includes the self-energy of the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another way: The potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the induced charges are -q_induced and +q_induced, but perhaps the net effect is that the potential energy is the same as if the sphere were replaced by the image charge, and the system's energy is the energy between q and q’. But in that case, the energy is U = k ( q q’ ) / r, where r is the separation between q and q’.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the induced charges on the sphere have their own potential energy. But the sphere is conducting, so the work done in redistributing charges on a conductor is related to the potential. But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero, which might affect the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) * k q q’ / r, because when you bring two charges together, the potential energy is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. Hmm, that might be it. So let me recalculate.

If U is the potential energy between q and q’, then U = (1/2) k ( q q’ ) / r.

Wait, why 1/2? Because when you assemble the system, each charge is brought in from infinity, and the potential energy involves the product of the charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy stored in the configuration is the same as the energy of the image charge configuration. So maybe the potential energy is (1/2) k ( q q’ ) / r.

Wait, but in the image method, the potential outside the sphere due to the charge and the sphere is the same as the potential due to the image charge. So the potential energy would be like the energy of the image charge and the original charge. So:

U = k ( q q’ ) / r,

where r is the distance between q and q’.

In our previous calculation, r = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, let's compute that again. The distance between q and q’ is d minus x, where x is the position of q’ from the center. Since q’ is inside the sphere, the distance from the center to q’ is R²/d. So the distance between q and q’ is d – (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = k q q’ / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k q q’ d / (d² - R²)

Earlier, I found q’ = - (R q ) / d.

Substituting q’:

U = k * q * (- R q/d ) * d / (d² - R² )

Simplify:

The d in the numerator and denominator cancels.

U = - k R q² / (d² - R² )

But looking at the options, none have just R in the numerator. Let me check the options again.

Option A: - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²) → denominator has (d² + R²)

Option B: - k q² d/(d² - R²)

Hmm, that's different. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the image charge.

Let me think again about the image charge. Maybe the image charge is not q’ = - R q / d. Let me re-derive it.

The potential at the surface of the sphere must be zero. So,

V_surface = V_q + V_q’ = 0.

V_q is the potential at surface due to charge q: V_q = k q / (d - R).

V_q’ is the potential at surface due to image charge q’ located at x from center, along the same line. The distance from q’ to the surface is (R - x) on the same side as q.

So,

V_q + V_q’ = 0 → k q/(d - R) + k q’/(R - x ) = 0.

We also have the condition from the image method that x = R²/d.

So,

R - x = R - R²/d = R (1 - R/d) = R (d - R ) / d.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k q’ [ d/( R (d - R) ) ) ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + k q’ [ d/( R ) ] = 0.

Divide by k:

q + ( q’ d ) / R = 0 → q’ = - ( R q ) / d.

Same result as before.

So the image charge is q' = - R q/d.

So the potential energy U is the potential energy between q and q’:

U = k ( q q’ ) / r,

where r is the distance between them, which is d – x = d – (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = k * q * (- R q / d ) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k * (- R q²/d ) * ( d ) / (d² - R² )

= - k R q² / (d² - R^2 )

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought. The potential energy of the system is not just between q and q’, but also includes the self-energy of the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the self-energy might be zero. Or perhaps it's already accounted for in the image charge method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the work done in assembling the system, which includes the work done in bringing charge q to its position and the work done in redistributing the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U can be calculated as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere.

But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The work done in bringing charge q would be q times the potential at its position due to the sphere.

Wait, but when bringing in q, the sphere has induced charges. The potential at the location of q is the potential due to the sphere, which, since the sphere is grounded and is a conductor, would have zero potential on its surface. But point charges outside the sphere would contribute to the potential at q's position.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated. Let me think of the system as consisting of two charges: q and the image charge q’. The potential energy is the energy of their interaction, which is (1/2) k q q’ / r, because when you bring two charges together, the potential energy is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r.

So, U = (1/2) k ( q q’ ) / r.

With q’ = - (R q)/d,

r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k [ q (- R q/d ) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= (1/2) k [ - R q² / d ] * [ d/(d² - R²) )

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * (- R q² ) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k R q² / (d² - R² )

Hmm, that's option D:

Option D: U= - (1/2) *k q^2 R/(d^2 -R^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system consisting of a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we use the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere ensures that its surface potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere.

### Key Steps:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge \( q \). Its magnitude is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{R q}{d}.
   \]
   The image charge is positioned at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere.

2. **Distance Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is:
   \[
   r = d - x = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the potential energy between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). Using the formula for the potential energy between two charges:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{r}.
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R q}{d} \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \):
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R q}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option D**.
