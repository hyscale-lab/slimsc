Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about space travel and time dilation, right? Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to special relativity. So the astronaut's experienced time would be less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast—like, super close to c. So we'll probably have to consider relativistic effects here.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find how long the trip takes from their perspective. But wait, the question is about the astronaut's lifetime. Oh, wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. Wait, that's the aliens' average lifespan, right? So the astronaut is 22 in their own time. But does that matter for the calculation?

Wait, no, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut during the trip. Let's think about the distance and the speed. But wait, we aren't given the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, wait, maybe I should assume that the distance is one parsec or something? Or perhaps it's a trick because the question is about time experienced, not the actual distance.

Wait, no, the problem says Earth is the destination, but how far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? I think the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away. Wait, wait, no, wait. The distance varies, but I think the LMC is roughly 160,000 light-years from Earth. Hmm, but maybe that's not needed because we're dealing with time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame and then apply time dilation. But wait, the astronaut's own time is the proper time, which would be shorter.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, which would be the proper time. So we need to compute the time it takes from Earth's frame, then adjust for time dilation.

But wait, first, we need to know how far Earth is from the aliens' starting point. Wait, the LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, so distance is about 160,000 light-years, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the distance as 160,000 light-years.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, I must have missed something. Oh, wait, perhaps it's given in the problem statement. Let me read again.

Oops, no, the problem doesn't mention the distance. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the astronaut's experienced time, so perhaps the proper time can be calculated using the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but without knowing the distance, how can I compute the time? I must be missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the time they calculate is the time from Earth's perspective, but then due to time dilation, the astronaut's experienced time is less. But without the distance, I can't compute either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the time from Earth's frame is T, and then T' is the astronaut's time, which would be T divided by gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but without knowing the distance, I can't find T. So maybe the problem is giving a different approach. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c. Let's compute the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.99999987c.

So v squared over c squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that:

0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2? Wait, let me calculate 0.99999987 squared.

Wait, (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.23e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.23e-7 = 0.999999746, approximately. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.34e-7.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is approximately 1 / sqrt(2.34e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.34e-7). Well, sqrt(2.34e-7) is about sqrt(2.34) * 1e-3.5. Wait, because 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So sqrt(2.34) is about 1.53, so sqrt(2.34e-7) is approximately 1.53e-3.5 = 1.53e-3.5 is 1.53e-3.5 ≈ 3.2e-4. Wait, wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, so 3.5 would be 0.0003162. So 1.53e-3.5 is approx 1.53 * 3.16e-4, which is about 4.83e-4.

So 1 / (4.83e-4) ≈ 2070. So gamma is approximately 2070. That means that from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock is running slow by a factor of 2070.

Wait, but we need to find the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. So if Earth-based observers see the trip taking T years, the astronaut's experienced time is T / gamma.

Wait, but T is the time taken to travel the distance D from Earth's perspective. So T = D / v.

Wait, but we don't have D. That's the problem I'm facing. So maybe the problem is designed differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think: the astronaut is 22 years old, and their lifespan is 150 years (as per their frame). So from the astronaut's perspective, how much time will pass during the trip? If the trip takes t years in their frame, and their lifespan is 150 years, then t must be less than 150 for them to survive.

Wait, but the problem states the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So the astronaut is 22, so they have about 128 years left in their lifespan. So if the trip takes longer than 128 years in their frame, they won't survive.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance from the LMC to Earth. Wait, but I don't have that info. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I'm missing a key point. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is using the concept of time dilation without needing the distance.

Wait, wait, another approach: The spacecraft is going at v = 0.99999987c, so the time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is T divided by gamma, where T is the time from Earth's frame. But without knowing T, how can I find tau?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance is 160,000 light-years, the approximate distance to the LMC. Let's try that.

So D = 160,000 light-years.

Then, in Earth's frame, the time taken is T = D / v.

v = 0.99999987c, so T = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c).

Since v is very close to c, T ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.0002 ly.

Wait, that's about 160,000 years from Earth's frame.

But wait, that's a very long time, and with the Lorentz factor of ~2070, the astronaut's experienced time would be T / gamma = 160,000 / 2070 ≈ 77.3 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 77 years. So looking at the options, D is 77 years.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 +77 = 99, which is less than their lifespan of 150. So they would survive.

But wait, the options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B)72

C)81

D)77

So according to my calculation, the correct answer would be D)77 years.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the distance. I assumed 160,000 light-years to the LMC. If the distance is different, the result would change. But perhaps the question is using a different distance? Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require the actual distance because it's a trick question.

Wait, another approach: The problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old, but the average lifespan is 150 years. So, in their own frame, they have 150 -22 = 128 years left. So if the trip takes more than 128 years from their perspective, they won't survive.

Wait, according to my previous calculation, the trip takes about 77 years, which is less than 128, so they would survive. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct answer is D)77 years.

To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we must account for relativistic time dilation. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light. At such speeds, the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) becomes significant:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Calculating \( \gamma \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 2.34 \times 10^{-7}
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.34 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 2070
\]

The time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( T \)) by the equation:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{\gamma}
\]

From Earth's frame, the time \( T \) is the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud divided by the spacecraft's speed. Assuming the distance to the LMC is approximately 160,000 light-years, we calculate:

\[
T = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

Substituting \( T \) into the time dilation equation:

\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{2070} \approx 77.3 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the astronaut will experience approximately 77 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and their average lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the trip, as \( 77 < 150 - 22 = 128 \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **B)** Incorrect. The calculated time is closer to 77 years, not 72.
- **C)** Incorrect. The calculated time is closer to 77 years, not 81.
- **D)** Correct. The astronaut will experience approximately 77 years during the journey.

\]

Calculating \( \gamma \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 2.34 \times 10^{-7}
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.34 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 2070
\]

The time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( T \)) by the equation:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{\gamma}
\]

From Earth's frame, the time \( T \) is the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud divided by the spacecraft's speed. Assuming the distance to the LMC is approximately 160,000 light-years, we calculate:

\[
T = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

Substituting \( T \) into the time dilation equation:

\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{2070} \approx 77.3 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the astronaut will experience approximately 77 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and their average lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the trip, as \( 77 < 150 - 22 = 128 \).
