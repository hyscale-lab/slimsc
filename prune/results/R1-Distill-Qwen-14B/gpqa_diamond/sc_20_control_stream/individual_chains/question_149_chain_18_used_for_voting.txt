Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integral suggests it's the same proton being split into two. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. They have equal intensity and the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. So, what's going on?

Hmm. Let me think about possible reasons for duplicate peaks in NMR and same mass in LC-MS.

In NMR, if two peaks are from the same proton, but they're separate, that could be due to slow exchange between environments. Like if the proton is in a dynamic situation, maybe in a diastereomer or an enantiomer. But wait, if it's enantiomers, the NMR would show the same shift because enantiomers have the same environment for each proton. So, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. Unless... the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, or maybe some other isomerism.

Wait, the question says the same alpha-proton has two peaks. So, maybe the molecule has some kind of isomerism that causes the same proton to be in two different environments. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But the LC-MS shows the same mass. If it's a precursor, it would have a different mass, right? So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. But enantiomers have the same NMR shifts because they're mirror images. So the NMR would show a single peak, not two. So B might not be correct.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Not sure what that means. Maybe it's something to do with the reaction producing more than one product. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for those two peaks, and the LC-MS shows same mass. So if it's a coupling issue, maybe the product isn't formed correctly. Not sure yet.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, if the same alpha-proton is in different environments, like in two diastereomers, each would have a different shift. But in the crude mixture, if you have two diastereomers, each would contribute their own set of peaks. So in the NMR, you would see two separate peaks for the same proton because the environments are different. That fits with the question: two peaks for the same alpha proton, same integral together (1H total), so maybe each diastereomer has one H, but since they are in a 1:1 ratio, the integral for each is 0.5H. But wait, the integral adds up to 1H, so if each diastereomer has one H, and they're present in equal amounts, yes, each would contribute 0.5H. So that makes sense.

Then the LC-MS shows two peaks but same mass? Wait, same mass? No, wait. If it's diastereomers, their masses would be the same because the molecular formula is the same. Oh, right! Diastereomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. So in the LC-MS, if the column can separate them, you'd get two peaks with the same mass. But the problem says in the LC-MS, both have same mass. So that fits.

Wait, but the question says LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity and same mass as expected. So that suggests two compounds with the same molecular weight. So maybe isomers, either diastereomers or enantiomers.

But enantiomers would have same NMR, so the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So in this case, the NMR is showing two peaks for the same alpha proton, which suggests two different environments. So that can't be enantiomers. So diastereomers (option D) are more likely.

Wait, but what's another possibility? If the compound is a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see any splitting in NMR because the shifts are the same. So two diastereomers would have different shifts.

Alternatively, could it be that the compound has an internal plane of symmetry, leading to a peak that's split into two due to some other reason, like coupling. But the question says coupling is ruled out.

Wait, the question states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, the two peaks can't be due to coupling with neighboring protons. So, that leaves either exchange between environments or isomerism.

Another possibility: the compound has some dynamic process, like if the molecule is interconverting between two diastereomers on the NMR timescale. But then, if the interconversion is fast, you'd see a single averaged peak. If it's slow, you'd see separate peaks. But in that case, the LC-MS would have a single peak, unless the LC can separate them. But the LC-MS shows two peaks, so maybe the diastereomers are not interconverting on the LC timescale but are present as separate entities.

Wait, the LC-MS is done at elevated temperature. Hmm, usually higher temps can cause more separation but also can cause some compounds to decompose. Alternatively, if the diastereomers are not interconverting, the LC would see them as separate compounds and give two peaks. The NMR, if the interconversion is slow, would see two separate peaks. So that fits.

So, if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, the NMR would show separate peaks for the same proton (since the environments are different), and the LC-MS would show two separate peaks with same mass. That aligns with the observations.

So looking at the options, option D is the mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and no spin-spin coupling. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a different molecular weight than the expected product. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, this explanation is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and have identical environments for all protons. Therefore, their NMR spectra would show the same chemical shifts, and only a single peak would appear for the same alpha-proton. This does not explain the two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" would not explain the presence of two peaks with the same mass in the LC-MS spectrum.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula but different physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts. In the NMR spectrum, the two diastereoisomers would cause the same alpha-proton to appear in two different environments, resulting in two distinct peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals. In the LC-MS analysis, the two diastereoisomers would be separated by the column, producing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. This explanation aligns with all the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the two distinct NMR peaks for the same alpha-proton and the two LC-MS peaks with the same mass.
