Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Let me read it carefully.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It says the E particles' total energy spectrum is continuous with some endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the new decay must be 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E particles' energy spectrum changes in this variant compared to the original.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear decays, especially beta decays, the emitted particles' energy spectrum depends on the conservation laws—like energy and momentum. In beta decay, the electron's energy is continuous because the decay involves multiple particles. Let me think about how that works.

In the original case, we have two E particles and two V particles. Both are emitted along with the two B particles. If E and V are, say, electrons and neutrinos (like in beta decay), then the neutrinos are nearly massless and carry away some energy. But in that case, the electron's energy spectrum is continuous because the neutrino shares the energy, leading to a range of possible electron energies. The maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when the neutrino takes negligible energy, so all extra energy goes into the electron.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V particles, we have one M that's massless. So what changes? Let me model this.

In the original decay, each E and V would carry away some energy and momentum. Since there are two of each, the conservation of energy and momentum must be satisfied for all four particles. But when you change the number of emitted particles, the situation changes.

Wait, the original problem has 2E and 2V, so four particles. In the variant, it's 2E and 1M. So the number of particles emitted is three: 2E and 1M. Or wait, no, the equation is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So total emitted: 2E and M, plus the two Bs, which might be heavy—assuming B is the same as A in terms of being heavy. So B is a heavy nucleus, maybe. But the question is about E particles, so the two E's. 

So, the original decay involved 2E and 2V. Let's model this as a decay where each E and V are emitted, and the Bs are probably recoiling but being heavy, so their kinetic energy is low compared to E and V.

In the original case, the E particles have a continuous spectrum because the V particles (like neutrinos) carry away varying amounts of energy, leading to a range of possible E energies. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy each E can have when the other particles take the minimal possible energy. 

In the variant decay, instead of two V particles, we have one M that is massless. So now, the decay products are 2E and M. Let me think about how this affects the energy available to each E. 

In the original decay, each E and V pair could carry away energy. But with two Vs, the energy shared among more particles might make the E's energy less. But wait, in the original, two E and two V are emitted, so four particles. Now it's two E and one M. So the number of particles is fewer.

Wait, but the number of particles isn't the only thing. The nature of M matters. If M is massless, like a photon or a neutrino, it can carry away energy without contributing much rest mass. So in the decay, the energy must be distributed between the two E's and the one M.

In the original case, with two Vs, each V could take some energy, but now only one M. So perhaps the energy distribution is different. Let me think about the energy conservation for E's.

In the original decay, each E's energy depends on the share of energy taken by the other E and the two Vs. But in the variant, each E's energy also depends on how much the M takes.

Wait, but in the original case, each E's energy is part of a four-particle system. Now it's a three-particle system (two E and M). So when the number of particles that carry energy changes, the possible energy spectrum for E would change.

In the original, the E's have a continuous spectrum because the energy is shared among four particles, allowing for a range of possible E energies. In the variant, it's shared among three. So perhaps the maximum energy (endpoint) for E would change.

Wait, but let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me model this as a two-body decay? Or is it more complicated because multiple particles are emitted? Hmm.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest. So the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. So the vector sum of the momenta of all the products must be zero.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The Bs are heavy, so their velocities are low, so their kinetic energy is small. So the energy and momentum of the E and V particles must balance each other. But with two E and two V, each E and V can have a range of energies and momenta as long as they sum to zero.

Similarly, in the variant, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So same initial and same final except for the Vs being replaced by M.

Wait, but in the original, each E and V are emitted. Since V are perhaps light (like neutrinos), their energy is variable, leading to the E's having a continuous range. Now, with one M, which is massless, perhaps the energy distribution is different.

In the original case, when you have two E and two V, each E can take a range of energies because the V's can take the necessary energy and momentum. But in the variant, replacing two V's with one M, which is massless, perhaps the energy available for each E is more or less constrained.

Wait, but in the original, the E's have a continuous spectrum because each E can have a different energy depending on the split with the Vs. Now, in the variant, with one M, maybe the E's can also have a continuous spectrum but with a different maximum energy.

Wait, in the original, the two V particles (each, perhaps neutrinos) carry away some energy. So E's share the remaining. If the number of V's increases, more particles share the energy, so each E's maximum energy would be lower. But here, the variant has fewer V's (they've been replaced by an M), so maybe the E's can have a higher maximum energy.

So if in the original, the endpoint Q is the maximum energy an E could have. Then in the variant, since there's only one M, perhaps the maximum energy for E is higher (because energy is shared among fewer particles). So the endpoint Q would increase.

Wait, but in the original, the E's have a continuous spectrum because the presence of V allows for varying energy distribution. If the variant has one M, which is massless, perhaps the E's now have a different way of distributing energy, but still continuous.

Wait, but wait: in the original decay, each E's energy is from the combined energy of all decay products. If the variant has one less V but one M, how does that affect the energy available per E?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the M allows for different energy sharing. For example, if M is a photon, it must carry energy and momentum in a fixed ratio because photons are massless (E=pc). So that might impose different constraints on the energy of E's.

Wait, but in the original decay, each V is massless? Or are they? The original decay's V could be something like neutrinos, which are nearly massless. So perhaps the V particles are massless in both cases.

Wait, the problem says in the original decay, two V particles are emitted, which are much lighter than A and B. In the variant, one M is emitted, which is exotic and massless.

So in the original, the V's are light but not necessarily massless. Hmm. Wait, the problem states that the V's are much lighter than A and B, which are heavy nucleons. So their mass is negligible compared to the heavy particles, but perhaps not exactly zero. But for the purpose of the problem, perhaps we can treat their mass as negligible.

So, if V's are massless, then in the original decay, each V has energy E_v = p_v c. Similarly, E's could have some energy and momentum.

In the original decay, the presence of four particles (2E, 2V) would lead to a situation where the possible energy distribution can vary more, leading to a continuous E spectrum.

In the variant, replacing the two V's with one M (which is also massless), so now we have 2E and 1M. So three particles in total (plus the two B's, which are heavy and can be considered as not carrying away much energy—so focusing on E and M).

So, for the variant decay, the energy and momentum must balance. The momentum of the E's and M must cancel each other because the initial nucleus is at rest.

Let me model this. Assume E1 and E2 are the two E particles, each with energy E1 and E2 and momenta p1 and p2. The M has energy E_M and momentum p_M.

So, energy conservation: E1 + E2 + E_M = Q_total, where Q_total is the total energy available (from the decay of the two A's into B's and the emitted particles).

Momentum conservation: p1 + p2 + p_M = 0.

Since M is massless, E_M = |p_M| c.

So, the momenta must satisfy p1 + p2 = -p_M. The magnitudes are |p1|, |p2|, and |p_M|. Their vector sum is zero.

But let me think about the energy and momentum distribution.

In the original decay, we had four particles (2E, 2V). Each V is massless, so E_v = p_v c. So their momenta can be in any direction, allowing a lot of flexibility in energy sharing, leading to a continuous E spectrum for the E particles.

In the variant, with three particles (2E, 1M), the M's momentum has to balance the sum of the two E's momenta. So the M's momentum is p = -(p1 + p2). So the magnitude is |p| = |p1 + p2|.

But since M is massless, E_M = |p| c.

Now, the energy equation becomes:

E1 + E2 + E_M = Q_total

But E_M = |p1 + p2| c.

Hmm. So the energy depends on the sum of the momenta of the E particles.

In the original decay, each V could have its own momentum direction and magnitude, allowing for more degrees of freedom, leading to a continuous spectrum for E's.

In the new case, the M's momentum is fixed by the E's momenta. Thus, the energy distribution might have different constraints, possibly leading to a different spectrum.

Wait, but in the original, the E's and V's can have varying energies, so the E's have a continuous range. Now, with one M, perhaps the E's have a different continuous range, but with a different endpoint.

What's the endpoint? It's the maximum possible energy an E can have. That occurs when the M takes the least possible energy.

Wait, no: the maximum energy for an E would occur when the M takes as much energy as possible. Or perhaps when the M's energy is as large as possible, leaving less for the E's.

Wait, actually, the maximum energy an E can have would be when the other particles (the other E and M) take the minimum energy possible.

Wait, for E1 to be maximum, E2 and E_M should be as small as possible. But due to momentum conservation, their momenta can't be zero unless E's are at rest, which isn't possible because the initial nucleus is at rest and energy must be conserved.

Wait, perhaps when E2 is emitted in the opposite direction of E1, so that their momenta can add up in the opposite direction to that of M. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum energy of E1 occurs when E2 is moving in the opposite direction to E1, and their momenta are as large as possible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the scenario where one E (E1) takes as much energy as possible, and the other E (E2) and M take as little as possible.

But because of momentum conservation, if E1 is moving in a certain direction, the sum of E2 and M's momenta must balance it.

Since M is massless, its energy is E_M = |p_M| c. So, M's momentum is opposite to the vector sum of E1 and E2's momenta.

Let me try to find the maximum possible energy E1 can have.

To maximize E1, E2 and E_M must be as small as possible. But their energies are related to their momenta.

Let me consider that E2 is moving in the opposite direction to E1. So their momenta are vectors in opposite directions. Let me assume E2 has momentum p2 in the opposite direction of E1's momentum p1.

So the vector sum for the E's is p1 - p2.

The M's momentum must be equal and opposite to this sum: p_M = -(p1 - p2).

But since M is massless, E_M = |p_M| c = |p1 - p2| c.

The energy equation is:

E1 + E2 + |p1 - p2| c = Q_total.

E1 = |p1| c,

E2 = |p2| c.

So substituting, we get:

|p1| c + |p2| c + |p1 - p2| c = Q_total.

Let me factor out c:

[ |p1| + |p2| + |p1 - p2| ] c = Q_total.

But what is |p1 - p2|?

This depends on the directions of p1 and p2. If they are in the same direction, |p1 - p2| = |p1 - p2|. If opposite, |p1 - p2| = p1 + p2.

Wait, let me think: if p1 and p2 are in the same direction, then p1 - p2 is just (p1 - p2). If p1 > p2, then it's positive; else, negative. The absolute value would be |p1 - p2|.

But if p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, then p1 - p2 is p1 + (-p2) = p1 + p2. So the absolute value is p1 + p2.

So, in the case where E1 and E2 are moving in opposite directions, |p1 - p2| = p1 + p2.

So, substituting into the energy equation:

p1*c + p2*c + (p1 + p2)*c = Q_total.

Which is (2 p1 + 2 p2) c = Q_total.

But that would mean p1 + p2 = Q_total/(2c).

Wait, but then E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c.

So E1 + E2 = (p1 + p2) c = (Q_total/(2c)) * c )= Q_total/2.

But the M's energy is (p1 + p2) c, so E_M = (Q_total/(2c)) * c )= Q_total/2.

So in this scenario, E1 and E2 each take Q_total/(2c) * something? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the maximum possible energy for E.

In the original decay, the maximum energy for each E is Q, which is the total available energy (from the decay) minus the energy taken by the other E and the two V's. Since V's are emitted, their energy determines the E's maximum.

In the variant, when only one M is emitted, which is massless, perhaps the E's can have a higher maximum energy because the energy is not split among as many particles.

Wait, let's think in terms of the original case. Each E can have energy up to Q, but when you have two V's, each taking away some energy, the E's maximum energy is less than Q. So in the original case, the E's have a maximum energy of (Q - whatever the V's take). So in the original, the E's maximum is lower than Q.

But in the variant, with only one M, which is also massless, perhaps the E's can have a higher maximum energy because the M can take more energy, allowing the E's to have more. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in the original, when you have two V's, each V takes some energy, so the E's have less. Now, in the variant, you have one M which can take more energy, leaving less for E's. So their maximum energy would be lower.

Wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think about it again.

In the original decay, the maximum E energy occurs when the two V's carry away minimal energy. But since V's are massless, their energy is tied to momentum. If all the V's (two of them) are emitted in opposite directions, their momenta could cancel each other, allowing the E's to have higher energy.

Wait, perhaps in the original decay, the maximum E energy occurs when the two V's are emitted in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other, leaving the E's to carry away more energy. Then the maximum E energy is higher than in the variant case where only one M is emitted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the total energy available. Let's say the initial nucleus (two A's) decay into two B's and other particles.

The total energy released is fixed, say Q_total.

In the original decay, Q_total is split among 2B (which are heavy, so low kinetic energy), 2E, and 2V.

In the variant, Q_total is split among 2B, 2E, and 1M.

So, the available energy for the E's and the other particles is the same in both cases.

But in the original decay, the two V's (massless) can take some energy, allowing the E's to have a wider range but possibly lower maximum.

In the variant, the M is one particle, massless. So perhaps the E's can have a higher maximum energy because there's only one M taking some energy.

Wait, but in the original, the two V's take away more energy collectively than the single M in the variant.

Wait, no. The original has two V's, each taking some energy, so total energy taken by V's is more than the single M in the variant.

Wait, no. Because in the original, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So, the V's are two particles, but in the variant, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So the variant emits one M instead of two V's.

Wait, the original emits two V's; the variant emits one M. So the number of massless particles is reduced. So perhaps the available energy for the E's increases.

So, when the original has two V's, each V can carry away some energy, reducing what's available for E's. But in the variant, only one M is emitted, which can carry less energy, leaving more for E's. So, each E can have a higher maximum energy.

So in the variant, the maximum energy (endpoint) for E would be higher than in the original. So the endpoint increases.

Now, about the spectrum's continuity.

In the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum because the two V's allow for a range of energy distributions. Similarly, in the variant, with one M and two E's, perhaps the E's can still have a continuous spectrum because the M can take varying amounts of energy, allowing E's to have a range.

Wait, but in the original, the presence of two V's (each with their own energy) allows for a continuous distribution. In the variant, with one M and two E's, perhaps the energy distribution for E's is still continuous because M can have varying energy, leading to E's having varying energies.

So the E's spectrum remains continuous but with a new endpoint. Since the endpoint increases, the correct option would be B: the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.

Alternatively, if the spectrum becomes discrete, but that would imply that the energy of the E's is quantized, which isn't the case here because we're dealing with continuous energy distributions in decay processes.

So the options are A, B, C, D.

Option B says the spectrum remains continuous, endpoint increases.

Option D says the spectrum remains continuous, endpoint decreases.

So in the variant, since the M is a single massless particle, the E's can have a higher maximum energy (since M takes less energy than two V's), so the endpoint increases. Therefore, the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The original decay process is \( 2A \to 2B + 2E + 2V \), where the outgoing \( E \)-particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint \( Q \). This continuity arises because the energy and momentum are shared among the four particles (\( 2E \) and \( 2V \)), allowing for a range of possible \( E \)-particle energies. The endpoint \( Q \) represents the maximum energy an \( E \)-particle can have when the other particles take the minimum possible energy.

In the variant decay, \( 2A \to 2B + 2E + M \), where \( M \) is a single massless particle, the energy and momentum are now shared among three particles (\( 2E \) and \( M \)). Since \( M \) is massless, its energy is tied to its momentum (\( E_M = |p_M|c \)), and its momentum must balance the vector sum of the momenta of the two \( E \)-particles to conserve momentum. This changes the energy distribution compared to the original decay.

In the original decay, the energy was shared among four particles (\( 2E \) and \( 2V \)), which allowed the \( E \)-particles to have a continuous spectrum. In the variant, the energy is shared among three particles (\( 2E \) and \( M \)), but the \( E \)-particles can still have a continuous spectrum because \( M \) can carry varying amounts of energy. However, the maximum energy (endpoint) for the \( E \)-particles increases in the variant because the energy is no longer distributed among two additional \( V \)-particles. The single \( M \)-particle takes less energy than the two \( V \)-particles would have collectively, leaving more energy available for the \( E \)-particles.

Thus, the \( E \)-particles in the variant decay still have a continuous spectrum, but the endpoint increases compared to the original decay. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
