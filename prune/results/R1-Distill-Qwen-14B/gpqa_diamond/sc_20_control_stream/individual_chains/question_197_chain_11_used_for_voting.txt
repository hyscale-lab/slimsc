Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all the spectroscopy stuff. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. But wait, red phosphorus usually indicates that it's probably an addition reaction. Oh right, red phosphorus is used in the formation of the oxymercuration or maybe it's for the addition of HI across a double bond. Oh wait! I think when an alkene reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to add HI across the double bond, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but I think more likely it's an addition.

So first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. To do that, I'll look at the IR and NMR data provided.

Starting with the IR data. The ranges they gave are 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I know that the 1720 cm-1 peak is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300, which is covered in the first range. So is there an acidic proton here?

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A broad singlet around 10 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but sometimes they can be a bit higher. Alternatively, that could be a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic acids have protons that are very deshielded, appearing around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the IR data has a peak around 1720 cm-1, which would align with a carbonyl like a ketone. Hmm, but a carboxylic acid would have a broader O-H stretch, perhaps around 2500-3300. Wait, the IR data says 3400–2500 cm-1, which includes that region. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an -OH group.

But wait, looking again at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton than an aldehyde. Because aldehydes are usually sharper. So if the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, that might be a ketone, but wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1 or a bit higher. So 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, maybe more like an ester or ketone.

Wait, but the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. That's really high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer? Or perhaps it's a phenolic OH? No, phenolic OHs are usually around 5 ppm or so, but that's the proton. The carbonyl would be in the IR. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which correlates with a carbonyl. Let me think. Suppose it's a ketone. Then, the peak at 10.5 ppm might not fit, because ketones don't have protons attached. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but the IR is at 1720, which is a bit too high. Alternatively, maybe an ester? Because esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740 cm-1. Oh, that's possible. So if it's an ester, then the IR makes sense. But then, what about the NMR?

Wait, the NMR also shows a peak at 10.5 ppm. Esters don't have protons attached to the carbonyl, so that peak wouldn't be from the ester. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent acidic proton. But wait, ketones don't usually have acidic protons adjacent unless it's something like a cyclohexanone or something, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe the compound is a phenyl group with substituents. Let's look at the NMR.

The NMR data: 10.5 (bs,1H), which I'm thinking is either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. The other peaks are:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) — this suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets each integrating for 2H, that's typical of a para-disubstituted benzene. So maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

So, if the substituents are in the para positions, one substituent is probably a carbonyl group (from the IR) and another is something else.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a methine (CH) adjacent to something, like maybe a CH2 or CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is maybe a CH2 next to another group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH which is split into a doublet. And 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl group. So putting that together, perhaps we have a chain like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3?

Wait, let's think. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH (since the coupling would be with a CH group). So the structure might be something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no. Alternatively, the 2.9 ppm is a methine group (like -CH-), and the 1.7 is two protons, perhaps on a CH2 adjacent to a CH. Let's imagine a structure where there's a CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. So, maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and a butyl group or similar.

Let me try to sketch this.

The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. Let's say one is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, and the other is a chain like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a secondary or tertiary butyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows 10.5 ppm as a peak, which I'm trying to attribute to a carboxylic acid. If the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, that would explain the 10.5 peak. Also, the IR shows a 1720 cm-1, which would fit a carboxylic acid carbonyl. Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid O-H stretch is usually very broad and appears around 2500-3300 in IR. The first range given is 3400–2500 cm-1, which would include the O-H stretch. So that could fit.

But wait, the IR doesn't have a peak in the 1720 area that's a strong one, but wait the first part says 3400–2500, then 1720, 1610, and 1450. So 1720 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl, which aligns with a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and some alkyl substituent.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 is a singlet, which would fit a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but sometimes under certain conditions can be a singlet. So maybe that's it.

So putting it together, the aromatic ring has a COOH group and another substituent in the para position. The other substituent is a butyl group or something similar.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

The 8.0 ppm is a doublet (2H), which would correspond to the protons ortho to the COOH group. And the 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be the para position protons of the substituent.

Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene with two groups, say, X and Y, each in the 1 and 3 positions? Or wait, wait, in a para substitution, the substituents are on 1 and 4 positions? No, para is 1 and 4, but maybe the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, but no, para is 1 and 4, meta is 1 and 3. So for two substituents in para, like 1 and 3? No, that's meta. So maybe in this case, it's a single substituent? No, because the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two substituents in the ring causing splitting.

Wait, perhaps the ring has two substituents, both in the para positions, and each substituent is causing the splitting. For example, if the ring has two substituents, each in the 2 and 6 positions (but that's adjacent to each other), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene. No, because the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which implies two substituents causing the splitting. So in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is in the para position, so the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. Because each substituent would de-shield the adjacent protons.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each on the 1 and 3 positions? No, that's not para. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-disubstituted benzene, but that would give different splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that's in the 4 position and another in the 1, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a substituent at position 2 and another at position 6, which would be para to each other. Hmm, no, that would be ortho.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions. So each substituent is at opposite ends. So the aromatic ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4. The substituent in position 1 could be a carbonyl group (like COOH), and substituent in position 4 could be a butyl group or something else.

So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each ortho to the substituents. So the protons in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the COOH) would be one set, and protons in 3 and 5 (ortho to the butyl group) would be another set. Each set would be a doublet because each is adjacent to two substituents, but wait, each substituent would cause coupling.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with groups at 1 and 4, the protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the group at 1, and the protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to the group at 4. So in this case, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be next to the substituent at 1, and the protons at 3 and 5 next to substituent at 4.

So the chemical shifts would be different for each set. The substituent at 1 (like COOH) would be electron-withdrawing, causing the adjacent protons (2 and 6) to be deshielded, so higher ppm. The substituent at 4, perhaps an alkyl group, which is electron-donating, causing the adjacent protons (3 and 5) to be more shielded, so lower ppm.

In the NMR, the peaks are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So the higher ppm (8.0) would be from the protons next to the electron-withdrawing group (like COOH), and the lower ppm (7.2) from the protons next to the alkyl group.

So the substituents are a COOH group at position 1 and a butyl group at position 4.

Wait, but the substituents are in 1 and 4 positions. So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted.

Now, looking at the other NMR peaks: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group (like CH2CH2CH3). The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, such as in an isobutyl group. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an isobutyl group.

Wait, the substituent is probably a butyl group. Let me think. The substituent is in the para position as a butyl group. The NMR for the butyl group:

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a methine (CH) group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is then connected to another CH2.

So, let's imagine the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Let me try to parse the NMR.

The substituent would be something like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let's think: the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's a t-butyl group, but that would have different NMR shifts.

Alternatively, think about the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, if it's a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, perhaps it's a chain like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the substituent is in the para position to the COOH group, and it's a butyl group. Let's think about the structure. The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): likely a methine (CH) group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): adjacent CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal CH3.

So putting this together, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, perhaps it's a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Let me think of the structure.

It's a four-carbon chain, so butyl. The substituent is likely a butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The NMR suggests it's a secondary or tertiary butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. Let me see: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. No, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The substituent's NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H): that's a CH group, maybe attached to another CH2 and a CH3.

The 1.7 ppm m (2H): two adjacent protons on a CH2.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to the CH. So the substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would make a butyl group.

Wait, let me try drawing a possible structure.

The substituent is a butyl group, say, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a 2-methylpropyl group, perhaps?

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3 group. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3 group. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group. No, that's a pentyl group, which is longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, I think a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but that would have a single peak for the CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl group or something else. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent's NMR shows a CH (1H at 2.9 ppm), a CH2 (2H at 1.7), a CH3 (3H at 1.4, d), and another CH3 (3H at 0.9, t). So this suggests a chain where the substituent is -(CH2)m-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a CH2CH(CH3) structure. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that would be a gem-dimethyl, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group where the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's an isobutyl group.

Wait, an isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Then, the NMR would have:

The CH(CH3)2 group would have one CH (the one attached to the ring), which would have two adjacent CH3 groups. But in the NMR, the substituent's CH is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would be the CH in CH(CH3)2.

The neighboring protons would be the methyl groups, but wait, the isobutyl group's structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is attached via CH2 to the CH(CH3)2.

Wait, that would mean the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the CH2 group, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 group is attached to the ring, then a CH(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 group would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH(CH3)2. The CH2 would be at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which matches the NMR data. The CH(CH3)2 would have a CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The methyl groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, but wait, why a doublet?

Wait, the CH(CH3)2 would have two CH3 groups attached to a CH, which is connected to a CH2. The CH3 groups would be split by the CH, but since they're equivalent, it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group. No, that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which would be a butyl group, but I'm not sure about the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think of the substituent as -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that's a pentyl group, which is longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe I should instead consider the possibility that the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, leading to a sec-butyl group. Wait, the substituent is a secondary butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. But how would that look in the NMR?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group where the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-2. So, -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl is -(CH2)C(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So that's an iso-butyl group. So benzene-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

But wait, the substituent is attached to the ring as a branch. So, substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's a pentyl group, not a butyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, that's a secondary butyl group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR has a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), which is connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d), and then a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t).

So, the substituent is a three-carbon chain, perhaps. Let me structure this.

The substituent could be:

benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group. No, that's four carbons if the substituent is attached via CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH3)- group, but with another CH3 somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a secondary butyl group. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But then, how about the NMR? The CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- would have the CH2 group next to the ring: the protons on that CH2 would be at around 1.7 ppm (m,2H), then the CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), and then the CH2 group at the end would have protons at lower ppm, perhaps around 1.4 ppm and 0.9 ppm.

Wait, let me try this structure:

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

No, that's a pentyl group. Wait, but maybe it's a butyl group where the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the CH2 group attached to the ring would be next to a CH(CH3)2 group.

The CH2 (ring attached) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH(CH3)2. So, the CH2 would be a triplet perhaps, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet, which can fit.

The CH(CH3)2 group would have a CH proton at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The two methyl groups attached would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), but why doublet? Because each methyl is attached to the CH, which is split by the neighboring CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But that would make it a pentyl group, which is five carbons, but wait, butyl is four.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's take a step back.

The substituent on the benzene is a butyl group. The NMR shows a CH, a CH2, and two methyl groups. So, the substituent is probably a tertiary butyl group. Wait, but a tertiary butyl group is -C(CH3)3. Then, the NMR would have a singlet for the CH2 group (if any), but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary butyl group.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the substituent as a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So the substituent would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, followed by a CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group (attached to the ring) would be a triplet or multiplet around 1.7 ppm (since it's next to a CH group).

- The CH(CH3)2 would have a proton at around 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The two CH3 groups on the CH would appear as a triplet or something else, but in the NMR, we have a 1.4 ppm (d,3H) and a 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Because the substituent would have two CH3 groups attached to the CH, which would be equivalent and appear as a singlet, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH3 group. Hmm, but that's a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, which is a neopentyl group. Wait, neopentyl is -(CH2)C(CH3)3. Then, the substituent would be a neopentyl group attached to the ring.

But in that case, the NMR would show the CH2 group next to the ring (maybe around 1.7 ppm, multiplet), then the central CH (if any), but neopentyl group is symmetric, so perhaps the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups.

But in our NMR data, the substituent's signals are:

2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups as follows:

The CH2 attached to the ring (position 1) would be next to another CH2 (position 2), which is next to a CH(CH3) (position 3).

So, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 (position 1) as a triplet or multiplet around 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH2 (position 2) as a quartet or multiplet around 2.9 ppm (2H), but that doesn't match the data.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which is a butyl group, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR shows a CH (1H at 2.9 ppm), then a CH2 (2H at 1.7), followed by a CH3 (3H at 1.4) and another CH3 (3H at 0.9). So the substituent is a chain like CH(CH3)-(CH2)-something.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring. So, substituent is benzene-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

In this case, the structure would be benzene-(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. Let me think about the NMR.

The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H). The next CH2 would be at a lower ppm, but in the data, the next is 1.4 (d,3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, which is a pentyl group. But that's not a butyl.

Hmm, perhaps this is taking too long, and I should just think about the possible options.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question is asking for the product after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So, what's the reaction? Probably hydrohalogenation. If Compound X is an alkene, adding HI across the double bond would give a dihalide, but I'm not sure. Another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydroxylation of alkenes, perhaps as in the oxymercuration, but I think red phosphorus is used in the formation of the triphenylphosphine ylide in the Wittig reaction. Wait, no, the Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide to form the ylide, which then reacts with an alkyne or another carbonyl.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used to deoxygenate epoxides, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another reaction: when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to do a hydrohalogenation, but I think in this case it's probably a halogenation. Wait, no, hydrohalogenation would add HI across the double bond.

So, if the starting material is an alkene, the reaction would give a diiodide or perhaps a vicinal dihalide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all substituted benzenes with either isobutyl or ethyl groups and possibly a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the product options include benzoic acid derivatives. So perhaps the reaction is adding HI to an aromatic ring in some way, but aromatic rings are generally unreactive unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe Compound X is a benzene ring with a ketone group and a substituent that is a methyl group or something else, and the reaction adds HI in a way that forms a dihalide.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the reaction part. Let me think again about what Compound X is.

From the NMR and IR data, I think Compound X is a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a butyl substituent.

So, its structure would be 4-(substituent)-benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then option C would be the product.

But wait, the question is about the product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So, if Compound X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, then reacting with HI would add across the double bond.

Wait, in that case, Compound X would have a vinyl group or a double bond adjacent to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is a benzene ring with a ketone and an alkyl group, and the reaction is some kind of substitution.

Wait, another possibility: if Compound X has an ester group. The IR shows a 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which fits a carboxylic acid. So maybe Compound X is an ester with a phenyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows an aromatic ring, so Compound X is a phenyl ester, perhaps.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Let me think again.

So, if I'm right that the substituent is a butyl group, then the product after reaction with HI would depend on what the starting substituent is.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, if the substituent has a double bond, like a vinyl group, the HI would add across the double bond. For example, if the substituent is a propenyl group, adding HI would give a diiodide.

But I'm not seeing that in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another angle: the reaction between an alkyne and HI with red phosphorus is a hydration reaction, giving a ketone. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the NMR doesn't fit that well.

Wait, let's recap.

The IR data shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, the compound has a carbonyl group. The 10.5 ppm peak is probably a carboxylic acid proton. So, that suggests the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

The NMR's aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent.

The substituent's NMR suggests a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl.

So, the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That is, a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if that's the case, what's the reaction with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, but if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Red phosphorus is a reducing agent in some reactions. For example, it can reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols, but in the presence of HI, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If the substituent has a leaving group, but I don't see any in the structure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a secondary or tertiary butyl group with a hydrogen that can be abstracted, leading to some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me consider the reaction conditions again: red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a reaction that converts an alkyne to a diiodide. Wait, no, that's with H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalysts.

Alternatively, when an alkyne is treated with HI in the presence of a cuprous iodide catalyst, it adds HI across the triple bond to form a vicinal diiodide. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved in that.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of an alkene. Red phosphorus and HI are used to add HI across a double bond. So, if Compound X has an alkene in the substituent, then adding HI would form a dihalide.

But in that case, the product would have two iodine atoms added across the double bond.

Wait, but the options don't show any diiodides. The options are all substituted benzenes without any iodide groups. So perhaps the reaction is not adding HI to an alkene within the substituent.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the aromatic ring, but that's unlikely unless under specific conditions.

Wait, or maybe the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can be a reducing agent, perhaps reducing a carbonyl group. If the substituent has a carbonyl, like a ketone, then reducing it would give an alcohol.

Wait, but Compound X is a benzoic acid, which has a carbonyl (COOH). Reducing a carboxylic acid would require strong reducing agents, like LiAlH4, which would convert it to an alcohol. But red phosphorus and HI might not do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydroxylation of a double bond. For example, if the substituent has an alkene, the reaction adds an -OH group. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation of an aromatic ring, but under those conditions, it's more likely to form a diiodobenzene, but that's not reflected in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, the HI could substitute a hydrogen to form a CH2I group. But again, the options don't show any iodide groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the reaction and what the options are.

Options A, C, and D have benzoic acid derivatives or substituents, while option B is a di-substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups.

So, the product is probably a di-substituted benzene with some substituent.

Wait, but the options suggest that the product is formed by reacting Compound X, which is perhaps a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo a reaction.

Wait, another possibility: if Compound X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a leaving group, like a chloride, then treating with HI would cause a substitution. But I don't see any indication of a leaving group in the NMR data.

Alternatively, considering that the substituent's NMR includes a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t), perhaps it's an alkyl chain that can undergo some substitution or addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation of the alkyl chain. For example, if the substituent is a butyl group, adding HI could cause a substitution at the end, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of an alcohol. But the starting material doesn't seem to have an alcohol group.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used in what's called the Schlenk's reaction, which is the hydroxylation of alkenes to form epoxides, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to add iodide to a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement, but that involves esters and aromatic rings, and occurs under specific conditions with a catalyst.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If Compound X is this, and the reaction adds HI, but I don't see any change in the structure. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting an ester to a carboxylic acid. For example, if Compound X is a phenyl ester, then treating with HI and red phosphorus might hydrolyze it to the carboxylic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is the carboxylic acid. So perhaps Compound X is the ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

But that depends on whether the reaction conditions would hydrolyze an ester. Red phosphorus and HI are more likely involved in addition reactions rather than hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the ester's oxygen is replaced by iodide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the reaction. The reaction is of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI.

If X is an alkyne, then adding HI would give a dihalide. But the options don't show any dihalide. Alternatively, if X is an alkene, adding HI would give a diiodide, but again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a substitution, but I can't figure out where the substitution would occur.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in Compound X is a benzyl position with a leaving group, but I don't see that in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a double bond to form a diol or diacid. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl iodide. If the substituent is a benzyl group (CH2Ph), then adding HI could substitute the hydrogen on the CH2 to form CH2I-Ph. But that would require a good leaving group, which I'm not sure is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit without a halide present.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If Compound X is this, and the reaction adds HI, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the substituent changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in Compound X is a carbonyl group, and the reaction reduces it. But the product options don't show any alcohols.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction adds HI across the carbonyl, but that's not typical.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product options suggest that the reaction is either adding substituents to the benzene ring or modifying existing substituents.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a di-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group.

If Compound X is a mono-substituted benzene with a substituent that can undergo a substitution or addition to form another substituent, then perhaps the reaction leads to option D.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an alkyl halide, and I don't think the conditions here would support that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration-oxidation, but that's for alkenes to form alcohols, and I'm not sure how that fits here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but again, I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in Compound X is a ketone, such as a benzaldehyde group, and the reaction adds HI to form a secondary alcohol.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, consistent with a carboxylic acid. So if Compound X is an ester, then the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

Ester hydrolysis typically occurs under basic or acidic conditions. But red phosphorus and HI are more likely involved in other reactions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. If that's the case, then the product would be a benzoic acid derivative, like option C.

But the question is about reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which I'm not sure would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne, forming a diiodide, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent in Compound X is a vinyl group, and the addition of HI gives a diiodide, but again, the options don't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the reaction leads to option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the starting material is an ester, which is hydrolyzed to the acid.

But I'm not entirely confident about the reaction conditions leading to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. But again, the options don't show that.

Hmm.

Wait, given the time I've spent and the data provided, I think the correct product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the answer would be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The IR spectrum shows a strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹**, indicative of a carbonyl group. 
- The broad absorption in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- The aromatic region shows **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**, consistent with a **para-substituted benzene ring**.
- The remaining peaks (**2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**) suggest a **butyl group** attached to the benzene ring. The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** indicate a **sec-butyl group**.

### Structure of Compound X:
From the spectroscopic data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI can act as a nucleophile. However, the reaction does not alter the aromatic ring or the substituents in a way that introduces iodine or modifies the functional groups. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituent is not an ethyl group, and the structure does not match the NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this structure does not contain a carboxylic acid group, which is evident from the IR and NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the spectroscopic data and remains unchanged after the reaction.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
