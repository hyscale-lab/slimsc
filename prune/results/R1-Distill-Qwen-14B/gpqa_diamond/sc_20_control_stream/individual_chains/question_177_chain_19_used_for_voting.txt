Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—both are 1.5 times larger for Star_1. They found that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm, I remember something about black body radiation and the peak wavelength. Oh wait, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if they have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same? Because lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So T1 equals T2.

Now, the stars are said to radiate as black bodies, so I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for their luminosity. Luminosity L is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity depends on the radius squared. So L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²). Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would point towards option A) ~2.25. But wait, let me check if there's anything else.

Wait, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity? Hmm, I don't think radial velocity directly affects luminosity. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, like the actual energy output. Radial velocity would affect the observed flux due to Doppler shift, but the problem states that the calculated luminosities are based on black body radiation. So maybe the velocities don't come into play here. 

Wait, but the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak of their black body spectrum. So if their temperatures are the same, then their L is R² times. So I think the answer is 2.25 times. So option A.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure. Could the Doppler effect shift the observed wavelength? Oh, right! If a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength of its light shifts. The problem says the observed wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, that would cause a redshift or blueshift. But since their observed peak wavelengths are same, maybe we have to take that into account?

Wait, but I thought the problem says the stars' own emission peaks are at the same wavelength. Because the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be shifted. So to have the same observed peak wavelength, their actual emission must have different temperatures, or something else.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's say Star_2 is moving away from us. The Doppler effect would make its observed wavelength longer (redshifted) than the emitted wavelength. So if Star_1 is at rest (radial velocity 0), its observed wavelength is the same as the emitted. Then Star_2, moving away, would have its emitted peak at a different wavelength, but the observed would be same as Star_1. So that would mean that T1 and T2 as emitted are different. Because T is inversely proportional to wavelength.

Wait, but this complicates things. Because if their observed peak wavelengths are the same, but their velocities are different, then their actual temperatures might be different.

Wait, the problem states that the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler effect must be making the emitted wavelengths appear the same. So the actual emitted wavelengths (what they would have if at rest) would be different.

So let me model this. For Star 1, observed wavelength lambda1, which equals its emitted wavelength because radial velocity is zero. So lambda1_emitted = lambda1_observed.

For Star 2, which is moving at 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so lambda2_observed = lambda2_emitted * (1 + v/c), approximately, using the Doppler formula. Since v is much less than c, perhaps we can approximate it as lambda2_emitted*(1 + v/c).

But the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So lambda1_observed = lambda2_observed.

Which implies lambda1_emitted = lambda2_emitted * (1 + v/c) → lambda1_emitted = lambda2_emitted * (1 + 700000/3e5) → v is 700 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So 700/3e5 = 0.002333... So 1 + 0.002333 is 1.002333.

So lambda1_emitted = lambda2_emitted * 1.002333. So the emitted wavelength of Star 1 is longer than that of Star 2 by a factor of about 1.002333.

But since the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature, T1_emitted = T2_emitted * (lambda2_emitted / lambda1_emitted) = T2_emitted / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667 * T2_emitted.

So the temperatures are not the same as I previously thought. So now, when calculating luminosity, I can't assume T1 equals T2.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So perhaps they accounted for the Doppler shift in their calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the peak wavelength they use is the rest wavelength, not the observed. But the question is a bit ambiguous.

But wait, the problem states that the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So that's the observed wavelength. So that's the lambda_max observed. So to find the intrinsic temperature, we need to correct for Doppler shift.

Wait, but if Star 2 is moving away, its observed peak is at a longer wavelength than its actual emitted. So the actual emitted peak for Star 2 is at a shorter wavelength than observed.

So the observed lambda1 = lambda1_emit.

Observed lambda2 = lambda2_emit * (1 + v/c).

But since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs, which is given, then lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * (1 + v/c).

So lambda2_emit = lambda1_emit / (1 + v/c).

But since Wien's law says lambda_max = b / T, so lambda1_emit = b / T1, lambda2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting, lambda1_emit = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

But lambda1_emit is also equal to b / T1. So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Canceling b, we get:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me redo.

Wait, lambda1_emit = b / T1.

lambda2_emit = b / T2.

But lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * (1 + v/c).

So substituting,

b / T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2)*(1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, v is positive if moving away, so T2 would be higher than T1?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the emitted wavelength is shorter. A shorter emitted wavelength implies higher temperature for the star. So T2 would be higher than T1.

Wait, let me think again. If a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer. The emitted wavelength would be shorter, meaning the actual star is hotter. So T2 is higher than T1.

So, the equation I have: T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Because (1 + v/c) is about 1.002333, so T2 is about 1.002333 * T1.

So now, the temperatures are T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 is about 0.997667 * T2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me clarify.

If Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c).

But for Star_1, lambda_obs is lambda_emit (since v=0).

So lambda_emit for Star_2 is lambda_obs / (1 + v/c) = lambda_emit_1 / (1 + v/c).

So the emitted wavelengths are lambda1_emit and lambda2_emit = lambda1_emit / (1 + v/c). Since 1 + v/c is larger than 1, lambda2_emit is smaller than lambda1_emit. So, since lambda is inversely proportional to temperature, T2_emit = T1_emit * (1 + v/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity, so perhaps they accounted for the Doppler shift in the observed wavelength? Because if you don't, you might miscalculate the temperature, and thus the luminosity.

Wait, no, the problem states that they computed the luminosity based on black body radiation, so they must have taken into account the Doppler effect. Or maybe they didn't, but the question is about the computed value. Wait, the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So I think the factors to consider are the radius and the temperature, which are now different.

So L is 4pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * k, where k=1.002333.

So (T1 / T2) = 1/k.

So L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1 / T2)^4 )

Substituting the values:

R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.997667.

(0.997667)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.997667 squared is approximately 0.995333. Then squared again: 0.995333^2 ≈ 0.99071.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.99071.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So about 2.227, which is approximately 2.23. So looking at the options, that's option D) ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought we don't have to consider the Doppler shift because the temperatures are the same. But that was incorrect because the observed wavelengths are the same, so the temperatures must be different.

So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Hmm, so the initial assumption that T1=T2 was wrong because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. So even though the observed wavelengths are same, the intrinsic temperatures are different, leading to a slightly lower factor than 2.25.

The problem involves determining the ratio of luminosities between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their radii and temperatures. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and both stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s. 

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:  
   The peak wavelength at which a black body radiates is inversely proportional to its temperature:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]  
   Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, the Doppler effect must be accounted for. For Star_2, which is moving away, its emitted wavelength is blueshifted, meaning its intrinsic temperature is slightly higher than Star_1's. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]  
   where \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), we find:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emitted, Star_2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{emitted, Star_1}}}{1 + v/c} \approx \lambda_{\text{emitted, Star_1}} \cdot 0.997667
   \]  
   This implies:  
   \[
   T_{\text{Star_2}} = T_{\text{Star_1}} \cdot (1 + v/c) \approx T_{\text{Star_1}} \cdot 1.002333
   \]

2. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   The ratio of luminosities is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]  
   Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.997667)^4
   \]  
   Approximating \((0.997667)^4 \approx 0.99071\):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99071 \approx 2.227
   \]  

3. **Final Answer**:  
   The computed luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This corresponds to option **D**.
