Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to think about what kind of compound that would be.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, two substituents on the benzene. And the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must account for 2 carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because each substituent is attached to the ring. So if it's a di-substituted, each substituent is maybe a single group. Let me think.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must be one carbon each, or something else?

Wait, maybe each substituent is a single group. Like, one substituent is a carbonyl group (since IR shows a carbonyl), and another is a halogen. Because the IR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so that's probably a substituent like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.

Wait, but di-substituted benzene would have two substituents. So, one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and another is a halogen. But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group like an acyl group. Wait, but if it's a di-substituted, the substituents could be a ketone and a halogen.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Let's say it's something like para-substituted benzene. So, two substituents opposite each other on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen. Wait, but a carbonyl group (like a ketone) is a single substituent. So, if the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, that would give two substituents on the benzene.

Wait, but wait. A benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, O=C-R), and the other is a halogen. But wait, no, the carbonyl is a group itself, so perhaps the substituents are an acyl group and a halogen.

But let me think about the number of carbons. Benzene has 6. Each substituent is a single group, so if one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -O-C-R?), but wait, no, perhaps the substituent is an acyl group attached to the benzene. For example, benzene with a ketone substituent, like acetophenone. But acetophenone is C6H5-CO-CH3. Wait, but that would add two carbons: the CO and the CH3. So that's three carbons (the CO is double bonded, but the substituent is a ketone, which is a carbonyl and a methyl group attached). Wait, no, the substituent is the acetyl group: -COCH3. So that's two carbons in the substituent: the CO and the CH3.

So the benzene has 6 carbons, the substituent is -COCH3 (2 carbons), and another substituent, perhaps a halogen, which would be one carbon (but wait, Cl is a substituent as -Cl, which is no carbons. Oh wait, halogens like Cl, Br, etc., don't add any carbons. So substituents would be:

- One substituent is -COCH3 (which has two carbons: the CO and the CH3)
- Another substituent is -X (like Cl, which has no carbons)

So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Oh wait, but wait: the COCH3 adds two carbons, and the halogen adds none, so 6+2=8. That works.

So the structure would be a di-substituted benzene ring with substituents at two positions, one being a COCH3 group and the other a halogen (like Cl, Br).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an acetyl group and a halogen. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another is a halogen. Let's think.

So, the compound is a di-substituted benzene with substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen. So, for example, para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 and a Cl.

Now, considering the IR data: presence of a carbonyl group (so the C=O stretch is present, which is around 1700-1750 cm^-1), and the aromatic-halogen stretch, which is typically around 600-800 cm^-1 (like C-X stretch), so that would be present.

So, now, the NMR spectrum.

Looking at the options, each option has different signals.

Let me think about the structure. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. So, one substituent is COCH3, the other is Cl.

So, the benzene ring would have two substituents opposite each other. The substituents are X (like Cl) and COCH3.

Now, the ring protons would be in a certain pattern. If the substituents are para, then the two substituents are opposite each other. So, in the ring, each substituent is at position 1 and 3? No, wait, para is positions 1 and 4. So, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (Cl) and 4 (COCH3), for example.

Wait, no. Wait, di-substituted benzene can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). So, in this case, the substituents are para.

In the case of para-substituted benzene with two strong electron-withdrawing groups (like COCH3 and Cl), the ring's protons would be deshielded. But more importantly, how would the NMR look?

Wait, but in a para-dichlorobenzene, all the ring protons are equivalent, so you get a singlet. But in this case, substituents are different: one is COCH3 and the other is Cl. So, their positions would affect the neighboring protons.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents: Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, and COCH3 is also an electron-withdrawing group.

In a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the ring protons would be split into two sets of equivalent protons. For example, each substituent would have two adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the ring would have two doublets. Let me visualize. So, if substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 4 (COCH3), then the H at position 2 is adjacent to Cl, and H at position 3 is adjacent to COCH3. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two sets of two equivalent protons each, each as doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two pairs of equivalent protons. So, in the NMR, you'd see two doublets, each integrating to two protons.

So, in the NMR, the aromatic region would show two doublets. For example, a peak around 7.8 ppm (d, 2H) and another around 7.6 ppm (d, 2H). That's because the substituents are de-shielding the adjacent protons, causing them to be downfield. The coupling between these protons would give the doublet pattern.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

The singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be a ketone (so no aldehyde). Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with a strong deshielded proton, like in the case of a nitro group, but not sure.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

The 2.3 ppm singlet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to an electron-withdrawing group, maybe like a COCH3 group. So COCH3 would have a singlet for the methyl group. So in the NMR, you'd see the methyl at around 2.3 ppm as a singlet (3H). Also, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, which is what option C shows. So that's a possibility.

Option A also has the aromatic doublets, but with a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I'm not sure about. But wait, the compound has a carbonyl group but no aldehyde (since FTIR shows a carbonyl, which could indicate a ketone or another carbonyl group like ester, etc.), but the presence of a singlet at 9.9 ppm would suggest an aldehyde proton, which would require an aldehyde group (RCHO). But in that case, the IR would show a strong peak for aldehyde C-H stretch around 2800-2700 cm^-1, but the question didn't mention that. The IR here only mentions carbonyl and aromatic-halogen, so perhaps an aldehyde isn't present.

So, option C's methyl singlet at 2.3 ppm probably corresponds to the COCH3 group. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which would be the case in a para-disubstituted ring where each substituent is in a para position, causing the adjacent protons to couple and split into doublets.

So, looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That seems to fit the scenario.

But let me check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

Hmm, the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm regions are typical for protons attached to oxygen, like -OCH2- groups. The singlet at 6.9 ppm might be an aromatic proton, but if the substituents are such that only one aromatic proton is present, that might not fit. Also, the substituents would probably lead to more than one aromatic proton. So this might not fit the scenario.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)

Hmm, similar to option D, these shifts suggest maybe ethylene glycol-type protons or something else. Not likely in an aromatic compound with carbonyl and halogen.

So, back to the correct structure. So, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a COCH3 (which would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the methyl group), and another is a halogen (Cl, Br, I). The presence of the halogen would influence the aromatic protons.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, then the two substituents are opposite each other, which would split the ring into two sets of two equivalent protons each. So each pair would be a doublet, integrating to 2H each.

In option C, the aromatic peaks are at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, which are typical downfield shifts for protons ortho and para to electron-withdrawing groups. The COCH3 group is a strong EWG, so the protons adjacent (ortho) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The para position would have another substituent, which is the halogen.

Wait, no, the substituents are in para positions. So, if substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 4 (COCH3), then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded, and those at positions 3 and 5 (meta to Cl and ortho to COCH3) would be shielded a bit differently?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: each substituent affects the adjacent protons. So, if the substituents are in para positions, the two substituents would each have two adjacent protons. So, each substituent would cause two protons to be in a certain environment.

Wait, maybe in a para-dichlorobenzene, all the H are equivalent, but in this case, substituents are different, so the ring protons would split into two sets. Each set would have two H, each as a doublet.

So, in the NMR, two doublets integrating to 2H each. And the COCH3 would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm (3H), which is present in option C.

So, that fits. The carbonyl group (from COCH3) would also explain the IR peak for C=O.

So, option C seems to fit.

Wait, but let me think again: the substituents are at para positions. So, the benzene ring would have Cl at position 1, and COCH3 at position 4. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), and protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). So, each of these sets (positions 2,6 and 3,5) would be equivalent within their own sets, but not between.

The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COCH3, while 3 and 5 would be ortho to COCH3 and meta to Cl. So, their chemical shifts would be different.

Thus, in the NMR, two doublets would appear, each integrating to 2H. So, option C shows 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which aligns with this.

The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3), which is correct.

So, this would fit the scenario. So option C is correct. Let me check the other options again to make sure.

Option A: 9.9 ppm would be a strong deshielded proton, maybe an aromatic proton next to a strong EWG, but also a singlet. But in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, I don't think there would be a singlet for an aromatic proton. Also, the 3.7 ppm singlet for 2H could be a methylene group attached to something, but I'm not sure.

Option B: The shifts are in the 4-5 ppm range, which is more typical for protons attached to oxygen, like ethers or esters. So, perhaps this is for a di-substituted group like two OCH2 groups, which doesn't fit the given substituents.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which might happen in a meta-substituted ring, but with two substituents, perhaps, but not sure. The other signals are similar to option B, which I don't think fit.

So, the correct NMR should be option C: aromatic doublets integrating to 2H each, and a singlet for the COCH3 methyl group.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Benzene contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃) and the other is a halogen (e.g., -Cl).

The structure is likely a para-substituted benzene, where the two substituents are opposite each other. The -COCH₃ group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the halogen (-X) also has a deshielding effect on the aromatic protons. This arrangement results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each appearing as a doublet in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The -COCH₃ group contributes a singlet for its methyl protons at around 2.3 ppm due to the lack of neighboring protons.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. However, the IR spectrum does not indicate the presence of an aldehyde. Additionally, the singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H) does not fit the expected pattern for this compound. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: The signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest protons attached to oxygen, which is inconsistent with the substituents described (a carbonyl group and a halogen). This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This option matches the expected NMR pattern.
- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H) suggests a single aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a para-substituted benzene. The signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm again suggest protons attached to oxygen, which is incorrect. This option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The correct ¹H NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH₃ group and a halogen substituent. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, and the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent appears as a singlet.

Now, considering the IR data: presence of a carbonyl group (so the C=O stretch is present, which is around 1700-1750 cm^-1), and the aromatic-halogen stretch, which is typically around 600-800 cm^-1 (like C-X stretch), so that would be present.

So, now, the NMR spectrum.

Looking at the options, each option has different signals.

Let me think about the structure. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. So, one substituent is COCH3, the other is Cl.

So, the benzene ring would have two substituents opposite each other. The substituents are X (like Cl) and COCH3.

That's because the substituents are de-shielding the adjacent protons, causing them to be downfield. The coupling between these protons would give the doublet pattern.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

The singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be a ketone (so no aldehyde). Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with a strong deshielded proton, like in the case of a nitro group, but not sure.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

The 2.3 ppm singlet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to an electron-withdrawing group, maybe like a COCH3 group. So COCH3 would have a singlet for the methyl group. So in the NMR, you'd see the methyl at around 2.3 ppm as a singlet (3H). Also, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, which is what option C shows. So that's a possibility.

Option A also has the aromatic doublets, but with a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I'm not sure about. But wait, the compound has a carbonyl group but no aldehyde (since FTIR shows a carbonyl, which could indicate a ketone or another carbonyl group like ester, etc.), but the presence of a singlet at 9.9 ppm would suggest an aldehyde proton, which would require an aldehyde group (RCHO).

The IR here only mentions carbonyl and aromatic-halogen, so perhaps an aldehyde isn't present.

So, option C's methyl singlet at 2.3 ppm probably corresponds to the COCH3 group. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which would be the case in a para-disubstituted ring where each substituent is in a para position, causing the adjacent protons to couple and split into doublets.

So, looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That seems to fit the scenario.

But let me check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

Hmm, the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm regions are typical for protons attached to oxygen, like -OCH2- groups. The singlet at 6.9 ppm might be an aromatic proton, but if the substituents are such that only one aromatic proton is present, that might not fit. Also, the substituents would probably lead to more than one aromatic proton. So this might not fit the scenario.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)

Hmm, similar to option D, these shifts suggest maybe ethylene glycol-type protons or something else. Not likely in an aromatic compound with carbonyl and halogen.

Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 1), and protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3 (position 4). So, each of these sets (positions 2,6 and 3,5) would be equivalent within their own sets, but not between.

The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COCH3, while 3 and 5 would be ortho to COCH3 and meta to Cl. So, their chemical shifts would be different.

Thus, in the NMR, two doublets would appear, each integrating to 2H. So, option C shows 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which aligns with this.

The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3), which is correct.

So, this would fit the scenario. So option C is correct. Let me check the other options again to make sure.

Option A: 9.9 ppm would be a strong deshielded proton, maybe an aromatic proton next to a strong EWG, but also a singlet. But in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, I don't think there would be a singlet for an aromatic proton. Also, the 3.7 ppm singlet for 2H could be a methylene group attached to something, but I'm not sure.

Option B: The shifts are in the 4-5 ppm range, which is more typical for protons attached to oxygen, like ethers or esters. So, perhaps this is for a di-substituted group like two OCH2 groups, which doesn't fit the given substituents.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which might happen in a meta-substituted ring, but with two substituents, perhaps, but not sure. The other signals are similar to option B, which I don't think fit.

So, the correct NMR should be option C: aromatic doublets integrating to 2H each, and a singlet for the COCH3 methyl group.
