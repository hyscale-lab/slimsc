Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because phosphate buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. And in this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is okay because standard conditions are assumed unless stated otherwise.

Hmm, orthophosphate ions. I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-

The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, for each step, the acid donates a proton, and the conjugate base is formed.

The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 (potassium hydrogen phosphate) would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it'll dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That means we have a buffer solution because a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-) are present. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, but here we're just trying to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? I think that's correct.

Now, the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.

Let me calculate moles of KH2PO4:

Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So, 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol equals approximately 0.00734 moles. Let me compute that: 1 / 136.09 = 0.00734 mol.

Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g divided by 177.99 g/mol. So, 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

So, the solution has 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.00561 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how much volume is the solution? It's 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So, the concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02805 M

But wait, is that all? Because the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is one of the components of this buffer. So the concentration is just 0.02805 M? But none of the options match that. The options are around 1e-7 M, which is way lower. So I must be missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. But in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms, right? Depending on the pH, it's in different protonation states.

Wait, but in a buffer solution made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the pKa2. Let me calculate that.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let's compute that.

Log(6.2) is approx 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208.

In a buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) and the acid (H2PO4^-).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

But in this problem, do I know the pH? Wait, the problem doesn't give the pH directly. Hmm, but perhaps I can find the pH from the given concentrations and Ka2, then find the actual concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which relates to the second dissociation step (Ka2). So the pH is around pKa2, which is about 7.2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. But wait, considering that H2PO4^- can dissociate further into HPO4^2- and H+. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is not just the moles from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, because some of the H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 might dissociate into HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Because in solution, the H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium according to the Ka2 expression.

So, the total concentration of HPO4^2- is the sum of the HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4·2H2O and the amount produced by the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the solution considering both the salts and the equilibria.

Wait, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, the problem is, I don't know the pH of the solution. So how can I proceed?

Wait, but maybe I can find the pH first. Let me think: the solution is made by mixing both the KH2PO4 and the Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, it's a buffer solution, and the pH would be determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the base and the acid.

But the problem is, without knowing the pH, how can I find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. The initial moles of HPO4^2- come from Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.00561 mol, and the moles of H2PO4^- come from KH2PO4, which is 0.00734 mol.

But in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+. So the actual concentration of HPO4^2- will be higher than just the initial 0.00561 mol, because H2PO4^- donates H+ to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells me that [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2). But without knowing pH, perhaps I can find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression for Ka2.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

So, rearranged: [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/[H+]

Wait, but [H+] is related to the pH. Without pH, perhaps I can relate [H+] using the ratio of the two ions.

Wait, but maybe I can find the pH using the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Let me compute the initial concentrations:

H2PO4^- concentration = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M

HPO4^2- concentration = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.764.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log(ratio)

pKa2 is about 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.764)

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.115. So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093.

So pH is about 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, I can find the [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka2 expression again:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/[H+]

We know Ka2 is 6.2e-8,

[H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M,

[H+] is 8.21e-8 M.

So plugging in:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.0367) / (8.21e-8)

Let me compute numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.0367 ≈ 2.28e-9.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 2.28e-9 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 0.0278 M.

Wait, but that's about 0.0278 M, which is 2.78e-2 M. But that's way higher than any of the options given, which are in the 1e-7 range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the actual concentration of HPO4^2- and the total concentration. Because HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+, but that's governed by Ka3, which is much smaller, so maybe that's negligible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by calculating the total phosphate concentration and then find the fraction that is in the form of HPO4^2-.

Wait, because phosphate can be present as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-, but in solution, the predominant forms are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is around 7.

Wait, but let's think about the total phosphate in solution. The total phosphate comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Each mole of KH2PO4 contributes one mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O contributes one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, the total moles of phosphate ions (in all forms) is 0.00734 + 0.00561 = 0.01295 mol.

But wait, that's the total phosphate. Some of it is in H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but then I can model the distribution of phosphate species using the given Ka values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the expression for the distribution of phosphate species in solution.

The sum of all species is equal to the total concentration.

But that might be complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in solution, the H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, and the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+, but given the Ka values, HPO4^2- dissociates much less than H2PO4^-.

Hmm, but the total concentration of all phosphate species is the sum of each.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the buffer solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the initial concentrations and then find [HPO4^2-].

Wait, let me go back. Earlier, I calculated the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] as 0.764, and using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, found pH ≈7.09.

Then, using that pH, I calculated [H+] and found [HPO4^2-] to be approximately 0.0278 M, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be right.

Wait a second, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I should set up an equilibrium expression.

Let me denote the concentration of HPO4^2- as x, and H2PO4^- as y.

But considering the solution, the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M (from KH2PO4)

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M (from Na2HPO4·2H2O)

But in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-

Let me let 's' be the change in concentration of H2PO4^- that dissociates. So:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 - s

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 + s

[H+] = s (since each dissociation produces one H+)

But wait, since the solution is buffered, the [H+] is determined by the pH, which we can find using the initial concentrations. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the Ka2 expression.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8

We can write this as:

6.2e-8 = (s)(0.02805 + s) / (0.0367 - s)

But given that Ka2 is small, s might be much smaller than 0.0367 and 0.02805, so we can approximate 0.02805 + s ≈ 0.02805 and 0.0367 - s ≈ 0.0367.

So:

6.2e-8 ≈ (s)(0.02805) / 0.0367

Solving for s:

s ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.0367) / 0.02805

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.0367 ≈ 2.28e-9

Divide by 0.02805: 2.28e-9 / 0.02805 ≈ 8.13e-8

So s ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration of H+.

So, [H+] ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

Now, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 + s ≈ 0.02805 + 8.13e-8 ≈ 0.028058 M, which is approximately 0.02806 M. Still, that's about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options given, which are around 1e-7 M.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the HPO4^2- comes both from the salt and from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. But in solution, some of this HPO4^2- could further dissociate into PO4^3- because of the third dissociation step. However, Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. So, the main forms are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions in the solution, considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system with both the initial concentrations and the dissociation.

Let me denote:

Initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M

Let 's' be the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+.

So, at equilibrium:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 - s

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 + s

[H+] = s (assuming negligible contribution from other sources, like water autoionization)

But wait, H+ can also come from the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+, but since Ka3 is so small, this will contribute a negligible amount. So we can ignore it for now.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8

Plugging in the equilibrium concentrations:

6.2e-8 = (s)(0.02805 + s) / (0.0367 - s)

As before, since s is likely very small compared to 0.02805 and 0.0367, I can approximate:

6.2e-8 ≈ s * 0.02805 / 0.0367

Solving for s:

s ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.0367) / 0.02805 ≈ (2.28e-9) / 0.02805 ≈ 8.13e-8 M

So, [H+] is approximately 8.13e-8 M.

Now, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 + 8.13e-8 ≈ 0.028058 M, which is about 0.02806 M.

But wait, that's way higher than the options provided. The options are around 1e-7 M, which is 1e-7 = 0.0000001 M. But 0.028 M is 2.8e-2 M, which is way bigger.

Hmm, this suggests that I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct species. Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I thought was HPO4^2-. But I've also heard that orthophosphate can refer to H3PO4, but that's less likely. No, I think orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and its conjugate bases are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the free HPO4^2- ions, not accounting for the H2PO4^- dissociation. But that's not the case because the calculation should include the dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not a buffer, but considering that the salts are the only sources of phosphate, but that can't be right because both are providing phosphate ions.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total phosphate concentration and then find the fraction that is HPO4^2-.

Total moles of phosphate in solution = moles of KH2PO4 + moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 0.00734 + 0.00561 = 0.01295 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so total concentration is 0.01295 / 0.2 = 0.06475 M.

Now, the fraction of phosphate in each form can be determined using the Ka values.

In solution, the phosphate exists as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But at pH 7, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the main species.

But how to find the distribution?

The distribution can be found using the equations based on the dissociation steps. Alternatively, using the expressions for each species.

The total phosphate concentration is [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = C_total.

But considering that the pH is around 7, H3PO4 is negligible, and PO4^3- is also negligible because of the low Ka3. So, [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ C_total.

But wait, to find the exact concentrations, perhaps I can set up the equations.

Let me denote:

[H3PO4] = negligible.

[H2PO4^-] = a

[HPO4^2-] = b

[PO4^3-] = negligible.

So, a + b = C_total = 0.06475 M.

Now, using the dissociation:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12

To find [H+], I can use the buffer equation again.

But perhaps we can model the solution using the charges.

In solution, the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges.

The solution contains K+ and Na+ as counterions, but they are spectator ions and don't affect the charge balance of the phosphate species.

So, considering phosphate species:

[H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-] = [H+] + [H3PO4]

But since [PO4^3-] is negligible, and [H3PO4] is also negligible because of the pH, the equation simplifies to:

[H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] ≈ [H+]

But from the buffer, we can also relate [H+] using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let's think about the expressions for each step.

The second dissociation is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, with Ka2 =6.2e-8.

So,

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =6.2e-8.

Let me let [H+] = x. Then,

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/x.

But from the charge balance, [HPO4^2-] * 2 = x + [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-]

But [H3PO4] is negligible, so 2b ≈ x + a.

But a + b = C_total = 0.06475 M.

So,

a = 0.06475 - b.

Substituting into the charge balance equation:

2b ≈ x + (0.06475 - b)

=> 3b ≈ x + 0.06475.

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe I should express [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-].

From Ka2:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/x.

So,

a + (Ka2 a)/(x) = 0.06475.

But I also have 2*([HPO4^2-]) = x → 2*(Ka2 a)/(x) ) = x → 2 Ka2 a = x².

Wait, perhaps I can substitute.

But this seems getting complicated. Maybe I should assume that x is around 1e-7, because the options are around that.

Wait, the options are between 3e-7 and 6e-7 M.

Wait, let me test with option D, 3.97e-7 M.

If [HPO4^2-]=3.97e-7 M, then [HPO4^2-] is b=3.97e-7 M.

From the buffer equation:

a = 0.06475 -3.97e-7 ≈ 0.06475 M.

Then, using Ka2:

Ka2 = (x * b ) / a = (x * 3.97e-7) / 0.06475 ) =6.2e-8.

Solving for x:

x = (6.2e-8 * 0.06475) / (3.97e-7) )

Compute numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.06475 ≈4.017e-9.

Divide by 3.97e-7: 4.017e-9 /3.97e-7 ≈0.01012.

So x ≈0.01012 M. But that's [H+] =0.01 M, which is pH=2. This is way too low, considering that the buffer is around pH 7.

Hmm, that's not making sense. So perhaps the assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, another approach: The total phosphate concentration is 0.06475 M.

We can model the distribution of phosphate species using the given Ka values.

At pH 7.2, which is near the pKa2 of 7.208, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are approximately equal. So, each would be about half of 0.06475 M, which is ~0.0324 M. But earlier I found 0.0367 and 0.02805, which sum to 0.06475, which is correct.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation says that when pH = pKa2, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 1. So, concentrations are equal.

But in our case, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] =0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M. So the ratio is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈0.764.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) ≈7.208 -0.115 =7.093.

So, [H+] =1e-7.093 ≈8.13e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka2 expression again: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can solve for [HPO4^2-]:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/[H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2=6.2e-8,

[H2PO4^-]=0.0367 M,

[H+]=8.13e-8 M.

So,

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.0367)/(8.13e-8) = (2.28e-9)/(8.13e-8) ≈0.02807 M.

Wait, that's about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in initial calculations. Let me double-check the moles.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:1.00g /177.99 g/mol ≈0.00561 mol.

Total volume is 200 mL, so 0.2 L.

So, concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] =0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] =0.00561 / 0.2 =0.02805 M.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but according to the buffer equation, the pH should be around 7.09, and the [HPO4^2-] concentration should be 0.028 M. But the options are much lower. So perhaps the question is not asking for the concentration in the buffer solution but something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer, but a solution where the phosphate exists in various forms, and the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, considering all equilibria.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here because the initial approach gives a value way higher than the options provided.

Wait, maybe I should try to calculate the concentration using the given Ka values and the initial concentrations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is made by mixing the two salts, which are each providing different phosphate species, and the solution is not a buffer but a solution where the phosphate species can interconvert.

Wait, but if the solution is a buffer, then the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are as I calculated, but that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate in the solution, considering that orthophosphate can be present as HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total concentration of phosphate in solution and then find the fraction that is HPO4^2-.

The total concentration of phosphate is (0.00734 + 0.00561) mol / 0.2 L = 0.06475 M.

Now, the fraction of HPO4^2- can be found using the Ka2 and the pH.

From earlier, pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, the fraction of HPO4^2- is given by:

f = [HPO4^2-]/([H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-])

But using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, at pH = pKa2 + log ( [base]/[acid] )

So, [base]/[acid] = 10^(pH-pKa2) = 10^(7.09 -7.208) = 10^(-0.118) ≈0.764.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 [H2PO4^-]

But [HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] = 0.06475 M.

Let x = [H2PO4^-], then [HPO4^2-] =0.764 x.

So, x + 0.764 x = 0.06475 → x(1+0.764)=0.06475 → x=0.06475 /1.764 ≈0.0367 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 * 0.0367 ≈0.02805 M.

Again, this brings me back to the same result, which is 0.028 M, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles. Let me recalculate:

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. 1.00 g /136.09 = 0.00734 mol.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g /177.99 = 0.00561 mol.

Wait, correct. So, the concentrations are correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- but is instead considering the initial concentrations only. But that can't be right because the buffer solution would adjust the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer solution, but a solution that doesn't involve a buffer. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which are two different salts providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is the sum of the HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O and any produced by the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But in this case, the dissociation of H2PO4^- is governed by Ka2, and the solution's pH affects this.

But without knowing the pH, perhaps I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should set up a system of equations based on the dissociation of H2PO4^- and the charge balance.

Total phosphate concentration: [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.06475 M.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =6.2e-8.

Charge balance: [H+] + [H3PO4] = 2[HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] + [OH^-]

But at 25°C, [OH^-] is 1e-7 M. But since [H+] is around 1e-7, perhaps it's better to ignore [OH^-] for simplicity.

So, [H+] ≈ 2[HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]

But since [H3PO4] is negligible, we have [H+] ≈ 2b + a, where a = [H2PO4^-], b = [HPO4^2-].

We also know that a + b =0.06475.

So substituting a = 0.06475 - b into the charge balance:

[H+] ≈ 2b + (0.06475 - b) = b +0.06475.

But from the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = ( [H+] * b ) / a =6.2e-8.

Substituting a =0.06475 -b and [H+] = b +0.06475,

6.2e-8 = ( (b +0.06475) * b ) / (0.06475 -b )

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps we can make an approximation.

Assume that b is much smaller than 0.06475, so 0.06475 -b ≈0.06475, and b +0.06475 ≈0.06475.

So,

6.2e-8 ≈ (0.06475 *b ) /0.06475 → 6.2e-8 ≈ b.

So, [HPO4^2-] ≈6.2e-8 M.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7 M, which is about 10 times higher.

Hmm, perhaps the approximation isn't valid because 6.2e-8 is about 0.09% of 0.06475. So maybe the approximation holds, but the calculated [HPO4^2-] is 6.2e-8 M. That's 6.2e-8, which is 6.2x10^-8 M, but the options are D)3.97e-7, which is about 6.3 times higher.

Wait, maybe the assumption that b is much smaller than 0.06475 isn't correct. Let's try solving the equation without the approximation.

We have:

6.2e-8 = (b (b +0.06475)) / (0.06475 -b )

Let me rearrange:

6.2e-8 * (0.06475 -b) = b(b +0.06475)

6.2e-8 *0.06475 -6.2e-8 b = b² +0.06475 b

Compute 6.2e-8 *0.06475 ≈4.0165e-9.

So,

4.0165e-9 -6.2e-8 b = b² +0.06475 b

Rearranging,

b² +0.06475 b +6.2e-8 b -4.0165e-9 =0

Combine like terms:

b² + (0.06475 +6.2e-8) b -4.0165e-9 =0

Approximate 0.06475 +6.2e-8 ≈0.06475.

So,

b² +0.06475 b -4.0165e-9 =0

Using quadratic formula:

b = [ -0.06475 ± sqrt( (0.06475)^2 +4 *1*4.0165e-9 ) ]/(2*1)

Compute discriminant:

(0.06475)^2 = approx 0.004193

4 *1*4.0165e-9 =1.6066e-8.

So discriminant is approx 0.004193 + 0.000000016066 ≈0.004193.

So,

b = [ -0.06475 ± sqrt(0.004193) ] /2

sqrt(0.004193) ≈0.06475.

So,

b = [ -0.06475 ±0.06475 ] /2

We take the positive root.

Case 1: [ -0.06475 +0.06475 ] /2 =0 → b=0

Case 2: [ -0.06475 -0.06475 ] /2 = -0.06475, which is negative and thus not possible.

So, the only valid solution is b≈6.2e-8 M, which is the same as the approximation.

But according to this, the [HPO4^2-] is 6.2e-8 M, which isn't among the options. The closest option is A)6.24e-7 M, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the solution is not a buffer because the amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are not in a ratio appropriate for a buffer. Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains both, so it should be a buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in solution, considering all species, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of PO4^3- and include it, but given that Ka3 is 1.8e-12, that concentration would be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the solution as a simple solution of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, and the ortho phosphate concentration is the sum of HPO4^2- from the salt and any produced by the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But earlier calculations suggest that the [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of free orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2- not bound to any other ions. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Perhaps the question is a trick question. The solution contains 1g of each salt. So, the moles are as calculated. The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 mol /0.2 L =0.02805 M. But that's not the case because some of the H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation using the buffer approach, [HPO4^2-] after considering the dissociation is 0.02806 M. But the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. It says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions", which is HPO4^2-, but maybe it's asking for the concentration of PO4^3-? No, because that's much lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the sum of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- concentrations, but that's the total phosphate, which is 0.06475 M.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the solution in terms of the total concentration and the speciation.

At pH 7.09, the majority of phosphate is in the form of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with the latter being predominant because the pH is slightly below pKa2.

Wait, but no, since pH is less than pKa2, the conjugate acid (H2PO4^-) is more prevalent. Wait, no, wait: at pH below pKa, the acid form is dominant. So, H2PO4^- would be more than HPO4^2-.

Wait, with pH=7.09 and pKa2=7.208, since pH < pKa2, the acid (H2PO4^-) is more than the base (HPO4^2-).

So, the ratio is less than 1, which is what I found earlier (0.764).

So, the concentrations should be as calculated earlier.

But again, the options don't match. So where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me recheck:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:1g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.00561 mol.

Volume is 200 mL →0.2 L.

So, [H2PO4^-] =0.00734 /0.2 =0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] =0.00561 /0.2 =0.02805 M.

Total phosphate: 0.06475 M.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

= 7.208 + log(0.02805/0.0367) → log(0.764) ≈-0.115.

So pH≈7.093.

Then,

[H+] =1e-7.093 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

Then, Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

So,

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/[H+] = (6.2e-8 * 0.0367) / 8.13e-8.

Compute numerator: 6.2e-8 *0.0367≈2.28e-9.

Divide by 8.13e-8 → 2.28e-9 /8.13e-8 ≈0.02807 M.

So, I'm getting the same result again.

But the options are way lower. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-? No, that's negligible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the given masses are 0.100 grams each. Because with 0.100 grams, the moles would be 0.000734 and 0.000561, leading to concentrations of 0.00367 M and 0.002805 M. Then, [HPO4^2-] would be around 3.67e-3 M, which is still higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the salts. Let me think about Na2HPO4·2H2O.

When Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it releases 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus 2 H2O. So, the molar mass includes the water of crystallization. So, 177.99 g/mol is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is not in a buffer, but the salts are dissociated, and the concentrations are determined by their solubility. But that doesn't make sense because both salts are highly soluble.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution after considering the hydrolysis of the salts. But that might not change much.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration using the formula for a buffer solution.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

But if I don't know the pH, perhaps I can't proceed. Unless I'm supposed to find the concentration without considering the buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the concentration contributed by the Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.02805 M.

But that's 0.028 M, which again doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- ions assuming no dissociation, but that would give 0.02805 M, which is not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. All my calculations point to a concentration around 0.028 M, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of the orthophosphate ion in the solution, which is the sum of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-? No, that's the total phosphate, which is 0.06475 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution when both salts are present, without considering the dissociation. But that would be 0.02805 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it releases HPO4^2- and Na+ ions, and when KH2PO4 dissolves, it releases H2PO4^- and K+ ions. But the solution is a mixture, so the ions from both salts are present.

Wait, but that's what I've been doing all along. So I'm not seeing where the mistake is.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution after the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can interconvert, but in a solution, their concentrations are determined by the buffer equation.

But again, this brings me back to the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer solution, and I should instead calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But with 0.0367 M H2PO4^-, and Ka2=6.2e-8, the concentration of HPO4^2- would be:

[HPO4^2-] = sqrt( Ka2 * C )

Wait, that's the formula for weak acids when dissociation is small.

So,

[HPO4^2-] = sqrt(6.2e-8 * 0.0367) ≈sqrt(2.28e-9) ≈4.77e-5 M.

That's 4.77e-5 M, which is 4.77e-5, but again, the options are lower.

Wait, but that's the concentration from H2PO4^- dissociation alone. The solution already has 0.02805 M HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, so the total [HPO4^2-] would be 0.02805 +4.77e-5 ≈0.028097 M, which is still around 0.028 M.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm adding the concentrations from both salts, but perhaps the solution's pH affects the actual concentration.

Wait, but I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't get the concentration to match the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, reviewing the problem statement: It says the solution contains 1.00g of KH2PO4 and 1.00g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, perhaps I swapped the moles? No, I think I did it correctly.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in solution, but considering that Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2-·2H2O, but that doesn't make sense because the water is part of the crystal structure.

Wait, no, Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration after considering the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But I'm not seeing any other way.

Given that all my calculations point to approximately 0.028 M, which doesn't match any of the options, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer solution because the amounts are such that the solution is neutral, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution after considering that some of it hydrolyzes into PO4^3- and H+. But that's governed by Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So,

[HPO4^2-] = [PO4^3-] * (Ka3 / [H+])

But without knowing [H+], this doesn't help.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 0.028 M, but this isn't an option. However, the options given are all much lower, so perhaps I made a mistake in initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate in the solution, which is the sum of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- multiplied by the appropriate fraction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe using the total phosphate concentration and the distribution of species.

The total phosphate concentration is 0.06475 M.

At pH 7.09, the fraction of HPO4^2- is 0.52 (from the buffer ratio 0.764, which is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.764 → [HPO4^2-] =0.764 [H2PO4^-], and since [HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] =0.06475, solving gives [HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M, as before.

So, unless I'm missing some key insight, I can't reconcile this with the given options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option D)3.97e-7 M, but I'm not sure how that comes about.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the given Ka2 and the concentrations.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

Given [H2PO4^-] =0.0367 M,

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/[H+] = (6.2e-8 *0.0367)/[H+].

But [H+] is 1e-7 (approx pH7), so:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 *0.0367)/1e-7 = (2.28e-9)/1e-7 = 0.0228 M.

Wait, that's even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the [H+] is 1e-7, so:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 *0.0367)/(1e-7) )= (2.28e-9)/(1e-7)=0.0228 M.

Again, way higher than options.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the option closest to my calculated value, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)3.97e-7 M, but I can't see how I would arrive at that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in a solution containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹². The solution is treated as a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with Ka₂ governing their equilibrium.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Initial Concentrations**:
   - \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.00734}{0.2} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M}\).
   - \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.00561}{0.2} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M}\).

3. **Buffer System and Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**:
   - The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with Ka₂ = \(6.2 \times 10^{-8}\).
   - pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208\).
   - Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
     \[
     \text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
     \]
     Substituting \([HPO₄²⁻] = 0.02805 \, \text{M}\) and \([H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.0367 \, \text{M}\):
     \[
     \text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.0367}\right) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
     \]

4. **[H⁺] from pH**:
   - \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

5. **Equilibrium Concentration of HPO₄²⁻**:
   - Using the Ka₂ expression:
     \[
     K_a2 = \frac{[H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}
     \]
     Rearranging for \([HPO₄²⁻]\):
     \[
     [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{K_a2 \cdot [H₂PO₄⁻]}{[H⁺]}
     \]
     Substituting \(K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), \([H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.0367 \, \text{M}\), and \([H⁺] = 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\):
     \[
     [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (0.0367)}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}.
     \]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (\(0.02806 \, \text{M}\)) is significantly higher than the provided options, which are on the order of \(10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). This suggests a possible misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the problem, as the calculated value does not align with the options. However, based on the calculations, the closest option is **D) 3.97 × 10⁻⁷ M**, though the reasoning to arrive at this value remains unclear.

Answer: D
