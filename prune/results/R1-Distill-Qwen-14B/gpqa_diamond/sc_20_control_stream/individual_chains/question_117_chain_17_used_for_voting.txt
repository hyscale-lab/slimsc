Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives four compounds and asks which exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different numbers. I remember that optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Alternatively, meso compounds can have internal planes of symmetry, so they wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected with substituents. The structure is a bit complex. I think if the substituents are in positions that allow for different arrangements, like if there are two identical groups on each phenyl ring, but the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. Like if the substituents are on opposite sides. Wait, the compound is dimethyl, so maybe the ester groups are on the 2 and 2' positions, and the nitro groups on 6 and 6'. I'm not sure about the exact structure, but if the molecule is symmetric, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl arrangement allows for stereoisomerism. I'm a bit confused here.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's like an ester where the propanoate has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-O-C-O-(CH2) something. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The formula would be something like CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that would have a chiral center. The central carbon (the one with OH, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups?) Wait, let me think. The carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, then the second has OH and the third is methyl. So, wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3? If that's the case, the central carbon is attached to four different groups: OH, COOCH3, two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- as the acid. 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the conjugate base of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one attached to OH, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So the carbonyl is on C-1. Then C-2 has the hydroxyl. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is on C-1, C-2 has OH and two CH3 groups? No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me draw it mentally.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with an OCH3 group. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- One methyl group (from CH3CH)
- One carbonyl group (from COOCH3)
- Another CH3 from the other side?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is the CH(OH) group. So the carbon with OH is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups? No, because CH(OH) is connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other. Wait, maybe it's:

The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH2? No, wait, it's a three-carbon chain. So the three carbons are:

1. CH3 (carbon 1)
2. CH(OH) (carbon 2)
3. COOCH3 (carbon 3, the ester group)

So carbon 2 has four substituents: CH3 (carbon 1), OH, COOCH3 (carbon 3), and maybe another H? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not possible because carbon 2 would have three substituents: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. But that's three; how about the fourth? Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. In the structure, each carbon in the chain can only have four bonds. So carbon 2 is CH(OH), which is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen? Or maybe another substituent.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 2 has:

- CH3 (on one side),
- COOCH3 (on the other side),
- an OH group,
- and a hydrogen attached? Because that would make four substituents. So the structure would have a central carbon (carbon 2) with CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Thus, four different groups: yes. So that carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound (number 2) can exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. That's a simple molecule with two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. Structure is C6H5-C-O-C6H5. Wait, no, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, and attached to two benzene rings. So, the structure is:

Ph-C(O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two benzene rings and an oxygen. But wait, that's three substituents. Wait, no, the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl group is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon has a double bond to O and two phenyl groups. But that's three substituents. No, wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbon in the middle is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to oxygen. That's only three substituents. Oh wait, no. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it has two substituents (two phenyl groups) and two double bonds. So the actual structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central C is triple bonded? No, wait, it's a double bond. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups and a double bond to oxygen. So that's three bonds. Then where's the fourth? No, wait, carbonyl group has a double bond, so the structure is:

Ph–(C=O)–Ph.

Wait, that can't be right because each carbon must have four bonds. Oh wait, no. The central carbon is part of the carbonyl group. So, each Ph is attached to the central C, which is double-bonded to O. So central C has two Ph groups, one O (double bond), and what else? No, wait, actually, the carbonyl group is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, but that would make the central C have three substituents: two Ph groups and a double bond O. So each C has four bonds, right? So the structure must be:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, that can't be. Each C needs four bonds. Oh, wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-Ph, but with two Ph groups attached. So it's Ph–C(=O)–Ph, which is a correct structure because the central C is connected to two Ph groups, one O (double bond), and another single bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Ph)₂CO, which is correct. So the central C is connected to two Ph groups, one O (double bond), and another O? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is (Ph)₂CO, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central C is double-bonded to O and has two Ph groups attached. So the substituents are two Ph groups, O (double bond), and nothing else. Wait, that's three, which can't be. Oh, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

No, each C must have four bonds. So the central C in benzophenone is connected to two Ph groups, an O (double bond), and another Ph group? No, that can't be because it's (Ph)₂CO. So actually, each benzophenone molecule has two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, but that's only three substituents. No, wait, the carbonyl group is O=C, so the central C is connected to Ph, Ph, O (double bond), and another H? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think that benzophenone has a central ketone group with two phenyl groups attached. So, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, but then the central C has two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and another double bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh, perhaps it's (Ph)₂CO, which implies that the C is connected to two Ph groups, one O, and another group. Wait, no, the carbonyl is O=C, so it's Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So the central C has two Ph groups, a double bond to O, and another single bond? But that would require four bonds. Oh, wait, the central C is connected to two Ph groups, a double bond to O, and a single bond to another group. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether benzophenone has any chiral centers. Well, if the central C is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl, that's three groups, but where's the fourth? Oh, wait, perhaps it's Ph–CO–Ph, meaning the central C is double-bonded to O and has two Ph groups attached. But that would mean it's trigonal, which is impossible for a carbon. So I must be getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps benzophenone is a diketone? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about the structure wrong. In any case, the key is that benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because the central C is double-bonded to O, so it's a trigonal planar structure. So no, it can't have a chiral center. So benzophenone (number 3) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond in the cis or trans configuration. Wait, fumaric acid is actually the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H, but that's maleic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is (Z), and fumaric is (E). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the two COOH groups on opposite sides. No, wait, no, that's not right. Let's think:

Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's actually the structure of succinic acid. No, wait, no, succinic acid has four carbons, with two COOH groups on the first and fourth. Fumaric acid has two COOH groups on adjacent carbons, with a double bond between them. Oh, wait, maybe I should think of it as:

Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two middle carbons and in the trans configuration. So it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond in between, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, I think fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H but that's not correct because that would be four carbons. Alternatively, the correct structure of fumaric acid is:

It's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is the (E) isomer, so opposite sides.

Wait, I think it's better to think that fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the two COOH groups on the same or opposite ends. No, wait, no, that can't be. Let me get this straight.

Actually, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two middle carbons. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, but that would make it a four-carbon chain. Oh, wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on either end of the double bond. In fumaric acid, the groups are trans: so the two COOH are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, replacing the -OH in the COOH groups with OCH3. So the structure would be CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that can't be because that would have four carbons with two COOH groups on the first and fourth, which is succinic acid. Wait, I'm getting stuck on this, perhaps I should move on. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Alternatively, for fumarate, it's the trans isomer of the diacid. So the diester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups (OCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So this would result in the molecule having stereoisomerism. Because the double bond is in the middle, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides, meaning it has E geometry. Wait, but wait, the structure with a double bond and two ester groups on opposite sides would have a plane of symmetry if they're both on the same side, but if they're opposite, it's chiral? No, wait, if both substituents on each carbon are the same, then it's not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on each end. So each carbon of the double bond has an ester group (OCH3) and a CH3 group. Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the groups on opposite sides. The dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but with the double bond. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end, connected by a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I remember that fumarate has a double bond, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to a possibility of geometric isomerism. But for optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or a meso compound. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, if the structure is where each end of the double bond has two identical groups, like OCH3 and another group, then perhaps it doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is such that it has a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, which wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents on the double bond are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. For example, if each end of the double bond has different groups, then perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, let's think about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So each of the two carbons of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, that can't be. Each carbon of the double bond would have one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. No, wait, no, perhaps each carbon is connected to an OCOCH3 group and another CH3, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons of the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, that would make each carbon have two COOCH3 groups, but that's impossible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond. No, that's not correct. I'm getting stuck here, but I think perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a double bond with substituents that allow for stereoisomerism. If the substituents on each end are the same, then it's not chiral. But if they're different, then it could be.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond, with each carbon attached to an ester group and a methyl group. No, perhaps not. Another approach: I remember that dimethyl maleate and dimethyl fumarate are examples of diastereomers. Wait, no, they are diastereomers because maleate is the cis diacid ester and fumarate is the trans. But in this question, it's about optical isomerism, not geometric isomerism. So if the molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule is planar and symmetrical, it can't.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might be symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is asymmetric, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, let's think again: if the molecule has a central double bond and each end has two identical groups, then the molecule might be symmetric. For example, if each end has a COOCH3 and a CH3, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not symmetric, leading to chirality. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think dimethyl fumarate does exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a meso compound. For example, if the structure has a plane of symmetry, so that it's achiral.

Wait, I think I need to find another approach. Let me think about the presence of a chiral center in each compound.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The biphenyl system has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions. So the structure is symmetrical across the central bond? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it could be chiral. I'm not sure about the exact structure, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric, leading to chirality.

Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the substituents around the biphenyl link allows for stereoisomerism. For example, if the two phenyl rings can rotate to give different configurations, but in reality, the biphenyl might have restricted rotation, leading to different isomers.

Wait, but if the substituents on each phenyl ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it could have optical isomers.

But I'm not certain about this one. Let me think about the others first.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is such that the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond (cis), is that possible? Or if they are on opposite sides (trans). But whether that leads to optical isomerism.

Wait, no, geometric isomerism (cis/trans) is a type of stereoisomerism, but it's not optical isomerism per se. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers, not from double bonds. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, optical activity can also come from other factors like planar chirality, but that's more advanced. For most organic molecules, optical isomerism is due to chiral centers.

So dimethyl fumarate, if it has a chiral center, would exhibit optical isomerism. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it wouldn't have a chiral center and thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, let me think: if the molecule has a double bond but no chiral centers, then it can't exhibit optical isomerism because it doesn't have any chiral centers. So for dimethyl fumarate, if the structure is such that the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical, hence not chiral.

Wait, the structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would be (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So each of the two carbons of the double bond has two identical groups. For example, each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think that each carbon of the double bond has two identical substituents. If that's the case, then the molecule would be symmetrical, so no chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So for compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, I don't think it has a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, another thought: if the molecule has a central double bond and each end has two different groups, then perhaps the molecule is chiral. For example, if each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group but arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me summarize:

Compound 1: Not sure, but perhaps has a plane of symmetry, so no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Has a chiral center → exhibits optical isomerism.

Compound 3: Benzophenone → no chiral centers → no optical isomerism.

Compound 4: Dimethyl fumarate → no chiral centers → no optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right because I remember that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer with dimethyl maleate. But that's geometric isomerism, not optical. So maybe dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

So which of the compounds show optical isomerism? According to my analysis, only compound 2.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

Option A: 1,2,4

Option B:3,4 → No

Option C:2,3 → 2 has it, 3 doesn't → so no

Option D:1,2 → 1 may or may not, 2 yes.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 1 might have a chiral center.

Let me reconsider compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Each phenyl has substituents at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. The substituents are nitro groups and ester groups (OOCR). The question is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents are symmetrically placed, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. For example, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are mirror images of each other across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical.

But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' and 6 and 6' positions. So each phenyl ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So the arrangement on each ring is as follows: for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). But 6 is the ortho position relative to the central bond. Wait, in biphenyl, the numbering is such that the central bond is between positions 1 and 1', so the substituents are at 2 and 2' (meta to the central bond) and 6 and 6' (para to the central bond? Or perhaps ortho? Maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each phenyl ring has an ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. If this arrangement is symmetrical across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks such symmetry, leading to chirality.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the IUPAC name suggests that the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions, implying symmetry. So the molecule might be symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Then, the only compound that does is number 2.

Looking back at the options, the options list:

Option A: 1,2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 aren't.

Option B:3,4 → no.

Option C:2,3 → 2 is correct, 3 isn't.

Option D:1,2 → 2 is correct, 1 isn't.

So the only correct compound is 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Wait, but looking back at the options, the correct answer would be option A if compounds 1,2,4 have optical isomerism, but I thought only 2 does. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure should be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that would imply each CH2 is attached to two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 → no, wait, that can't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3, with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, I think the correct structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

But each carbon of the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups attached, which would make that carbon have three substituents plus the double bond. That's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So maybe the structure is CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 → but that's a single bond. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)₂, which would imply each CH2 is attached to a COOCH3 and a double bond, but that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck here, but perhaps it's better to think that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another approach: if the molecule has two identical groups on each side of the double bond, then it's symmetrical, so no chiral center. But if the groups are different, then perhaps it's asymmetrical. But in fumarate, each end is the same, so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound showing optical isomerism is number 2.

Looking again at the options, the only option that includes only 2 is none of them. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, which is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B)3 and4 → no.

C)2 and3 → no, because 3 doesn't have it.

D)1 and2 → no, because 1 doesn't have it.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Let me think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6', which are symmetrically opposite positions, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral. For example, if on one phenyl ring, the substituents are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro), and on the other ring, they are arranged differently. But wait, the name suggests that both rings have the same substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So 2 and 2' have ester groups, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups. So each phenyl ring has an ester at 2 and a nitro at 6.

But in a biphenyl system, the two rings are connected by a single bond, so rotation around that bond can lead to different configurations.

Wait, but in reality, biphenyls can have different conformations, but as far as I know, they can freely rotate unless hindered. But in this case, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions, which are para to each other. Wait, no, 2 and 6 are meta positions. So perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is not symmetrical.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is such that it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that reflects each other, then it's symmetrical. Otherwise, it's not.

But I think in this case, the molecule might not be symmetrical because the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are meta positions, leading to a lack of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule could be chiral.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Then, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism would be 1 and 2. Looking back at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

But then, I'm getting conflicting thoughts about whether compound 1 actually has a chiral center or not.

Alternatively, perhaps each phenyl ring has substituents in such a way that the entire molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Wait, but I'm not an expert, and this is a bit unclear. So perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

I think compound 2 definitely has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism. If compound 1 also has a chiral center, then option D would be correct. But I'm not entirely sure about compound 1.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center, so only compound 2 does. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. Structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, but arranged in the E configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

In this structure, each carbon of the double bond is connected to an ester group (OOCCH3) and a CH3 group. No, wait, each carbon is connected to two ester groups? No, each carbon is connected to an ester group and a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the CH2 groups. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. In this case, each CH has two COOCH3 groups attached. But that would give each carbon three substituents: two COOCH3 and a double bond. Which isn't possible because each carbon needs four bonds. So perhaps that's not the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure would be CH3OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 → but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      CH2-CH2
     /
O-C-OCH3

But that's a single bond. I'm getting stuck again.

I think I'm overcomplicating this, but I'll proceed. If dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with identical groups on each end, it won't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Only compound 2 and possibly compound 1.

If compound 1 has a chiral center, then option D (1 and 2) is correct. But if it doesn't, then only 2 is correct, but no option includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's recap:

- Compound 2: has a chiral center → yes.

- Compound 1: has a biphenyl structure with substituents at 2,2' and 6,6'. If these substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule is chiral. Otherwise, not.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm not sure. But considering the IUPAC name, the substituents are at symmetrical positions, so the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So then, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that only includes 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

If dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with ester groups on each end, and the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, the molecule would be symmetrical. So, for example, if each carbon of the double bond has an OOCCH3 and a CH3 group, then it's symmetrical. So no chiral center.

Therefore, compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Then, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). But if 1 doesn't have it, then none of the options are correct, which isn't possible. So perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each phenyl ring has an ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. The biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Now, in a biphenyl system, the substituents can be in different positions relative to each other, leading to different isomers.

If the substituents on each ring are in such positions that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents leads to a situation where the molecule has a chiral center. But wait, the molecule itself doesn't have a chiral center; it's the arrangement of substituents around the biphenyl that gives rise to stereoisomerism.

Wait, but optical isomerism in biphenyl systems usually arises from the arrangement around the central bond, leading to different diastereomers. But biphenyls themselves aren't chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has axial chirality, which is a type of chirality arising from the arrangement around a single bond, like in allenes or biphenyls. Axial chirality is a concept where the central bond has substituents arranged in a non-superimposable manner.

In that case, the molecule could exhibit optical isomerism if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond, then the molecule would have axial chirality and exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. If these are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Given that, I think compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism because the substituents create an asymmetric arrangement around the central bond, leading to axial chirality.

So, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

So, the correct answer would be option A? Wait, no, option D is 1 and 2.

Therefore, the answer is option A) 1,2,4? No, because I thought 4 doesn't. Wait, no, option D is 1 and 2.

Wait, but according to this, compounds 1 and 2 do exhibit optical isomerism, so the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and has a non-superimposable mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, with ester groups at the 2,2' positions and nitro groups at the 6,6' positions. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the rings are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. Since the substituents are not symmetrical, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and can exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule therefore exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. Since this carbon does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and unable to exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a double bond with identical groups (COOCH₃) on both sides, giving it a plane of symmetry. As a result, it does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of chirality. Compound 3 lacks chirality because it has a plane of symmetry, and compound 4 lacks chirality because its substituents are identical on both sides of the double bond.
