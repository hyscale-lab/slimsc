Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Hmm, so a proton and antiproton annihilating into two particles each of charges +1 and -1, maybe like pions or something else? Not sure, but the mass of particle A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. 

The problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so I'm guessing I need to use some relativistic equations here. Let me think about conservation laws because this is a particle physics problem.

In any annihilation process, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can assume that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is 'slowly moving'—so perhaps it's non-relativistic? But protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass, right? So the rest energy of each is about 938 MeV, I think. So if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest energy. But wait, the system is p and p̄ colliding. 

Wait, but in annihilation processes, in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Because initially, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. Or wait, no, the initial system (proton + antiproton) must have certain momentum.

Wait, maybe I should consider the initial and final momentum. Let me think: the initial state is a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄) moving towards each other. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Or is the proton also moving? Hmm, the way the problem is phrased, I think the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. Because otherwise, it's unclear. So initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

So, in the initial state, the proton is at rest, so momentum is zero, and the antiproton has momentum p̄_p. The total initial momentum is therefore p̄_p.

In the final state, we have four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Since each A is a particle, their momenta must add up to the same total as the initial momentum. Also, energy must be conserved.

But wait, this could get complicated with four particles. Hmm. Maybe there's a way to simplify this. Let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote the initial proton as being at rest, so its energy is m_p c², which is about 938 MeV. The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its energy is gamma m_p c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Its momentum is gamma m_p v. 

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so v is much less than c. So gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but perhaps I can make some approximations here. Or wait, maybe not, because the mass of A is 300 MeV, which is less than m_p c². So maybe the energy isn't too high, but I'm not sure.

The final state: four particles, each A is either + or -, but I think they might be moving in opposite directions or something. Wait, but the initial system's momentum is just that of the antiproton. So the total momentum of the final state must equal the initial momentum, which is gamma m_p v (assuming the proton is at rest).

Wait, but considering that, the four particles in the final state must have a net momentum equal to that. Maybe it's easier to look at the problem in the center of mass frame, but then again, the initial momentum isn't zero. Alternatively, perhaps in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Wait, maybe let's assume that in the final state, the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are created symmetrically, so that the total momentum is carried by all of them. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the process is symmetric, so the four particles have momenta that cancel each other out except for the initial momentum. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a two-body annihilation, but it's stated as producing four particles. Maybe each A+ and A- are a pair, so perhaps we can treat them as moving in pairs. Or perhaps each A is moving in some direction but the total momentum sums up.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all four particles move with the same speed, so their momentum vectors add up. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. If that's the case, then perhaps each pair's momenta cancel, so the total momentum of all four is zero. But that can't be the case because the initial system's momentum isn't zero.

Wait, maybe the initial system (proton and antiproton) is moving, so the total initial momentum is that of the antiproton. So the final particles must have a net momentum equal to that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about energy and momentum in this reaction. The initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. Since the proton is at rest, its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c². So the total initial energy is (1 + gamma) m_p c².

After annihilation, the final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has energy E = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is their Lorentz factor. The total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

But wait, because each A could be moving in a different direction, their energies and momenta will vary. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

But perhaps there's an assumption here that the particles A are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Since the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton (p̄_p), the total momentum of the four A's must be equal to p̄_p.

Alternatively, perhaps because the antiproton is moving slowly, we can approximate the system as non-relativistic. That is, the velocities are low enough that relativistic effects are small. But I'm not sure. The problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton's rest mass. So maybe the velocities are significant but not extremely close to c.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this process is similar to pair production, but in this case, annihilation. Maybe the key is to consider conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the initial momentum as p_initial = gamma m_p v_p, where v_p is the velocity of the antiproton. Since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero.

In the final state, each A particle has momentum p_A. Suppose all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. But that's not likely; perhaps they move in some symmetric fashion. Alternatively, maybe each pair (A+ and A-) moves in opposite directions, leading to cancellation of their momenta. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is symmetric in a way that the A+ and A- are produced in pairs, so the momentum of each pair might cancel each other. For example, each A+ and A- could be moving in opposite directions with the same speed, so their momenta sum to zero. If that's the case, then the net momentum of all four particles would just be the sum of the two pairs. But each pair's momentum cancels, so the total momentum is zero. But that can't be, because the initial system has momentum p_initial. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the four particles are moving in two pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but each pair has some net momentum. So each pair has a momentum p, and the other pair has momentum p in the opposite direction. But wait, this would make the total momentum zero, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving in such a way that two are moving in one direction and two in another, each with some momentum. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as each pair (A+ and A-) moving in opposite directions, but with each pair's momentum adding up to something.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. But that seems unlikely because the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. So perhaps each A particle is moving in the same direction, each with the same speed. So the total momentum would be 4 * p_A.

Wait, but that would make the total momentum 4 p_A. So 4 p_A = p_initial.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are arranged symmetrically, so their momentum vectors sum up to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the problem in the center of mass (COM) frame. In the COM frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the final state would also be zero. But in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the situation is different.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the total energy and momentum in the lab frame and set up equations for conservation. Let's try that.

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v_p.

Final energy: E_final = 4 * gamma_A m_A c².

Wait, but that's only if all four A particles have the same speed. But in reality, their speeds and directions might vary. So that's a big assumption, but perhaps it's necessary for solving the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the particles are moving with the same speed, so their energies and momenta are the same. So if we make that assumption, maybe we can proceed.

So, assuming that all four A particles have the same speed v, then each has energy gamma_A m_A c², and momentum gamma_A m_A v in their respective directions. But the sum of their momenta must equal the initial momentum.

Wait, but if each A is moving in a direction that their momenta add up to p_initial, perhaps it's more manageable. But I'm not sure about the directions. Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. That would make the total momentum 4 gamma_A m_A v. So:

4 gamma_A m_A v = gamma m_p v_p.

Hmm. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the system's energy is conserved. The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So equate these two:

m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Simplify:

(1 + gamma) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

(1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A).

Hmm, but I don't know gamma yet. Gamma is for the antiproton's motion. Wait, but the antiproton's velocity is given to be 'slowly moving', which probably means non-relativistic, so gamma is approximately 1. But if that's the case, then gamma ≈ 1.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but for small velocities, we can approximate gamma as 1. So, gamma ≈ 1. Then,

gamma_A ≈ (1 + 1) m_p / (4 m_A) = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Given that m_A c² is 300 MeV, and m_p c² is about 938 MeV, so m_p ≈ 3.127 m_A (since 938 / 300 ≈ 3.127).

So,

gamma_A ≈ (3.127 m_A) / (2 m_A) ) = 3.127 / 2 ≈ 1.5635.

So gamma_A is about 1.5635. Then, the Lorentz factor gamma_A is 1.5635. Now, to find v, the velocity of A.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So,

1.5635 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / 1.5635 ≈ 0.64.

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 0.4096.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

v/c = sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768 c.

Wait, that's approximately 0.77c. Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. So is that the answer?

But wait, I made an assumption that gamma is approximately 1, which is only valid if the antiproton's velocity is non-relativistic. However, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so this approximation might hold. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the initial assumption that all four A particles have the same speed and direction may not hold, but perhaps it's the intended approach for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about the total energy and momentum.

Another approach: considering that the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻.

Since the proton is at rest, initial momentum is that of the antiproton, which is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final energy is E_final = sum of the energies of the four A particles. Assuming each A has energy E_A, E_final = 4 E_A.

Similarly, the final momentum must be equal to the initial momentum, so the sum of the momenta of the four A's equals p_initial.

But if I assume that the four A's are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial, perhaps each is moving in the same direction. So, the total momentum is 4 p_A = p_initial.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_p.

Hmm. But I have two unknowns here: v_A and gamma. Because I don't know v_p, the velocity of the antiproton.

But wait, perhaps I can relate the energies as well. So, from energy conservation:

E_initial = E_final → m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So two equations:

1) 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_p.

2) (1 + gamma) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Simplify equation 2: (1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma) m_p ) / (4 m_A ).

Substituting into equation 1:

4 * [ ( (1 + gamma) m_p ) / (4 m_A ) ] * m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_p.

Wait, let's plug in gamma_A:

gamma_A = (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A )

So,

4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A ) ] * m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_p.

Simplify:

(1 + gamma) m_p v_A = gamma m_p v_p.

Cancel m_p from both sides:

(1 + gamma) v_A = gamma v_p.

So,

v_A = [ gamma v_p ] / (1 + gamma ).

Hmm. Now, using equation 2 again: (1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

But from equation 2 substitution, this gives gamma_A in terms of gamma.

Wait, maybe we can express v_p in terms of beta_p (v_p = beta_p c), and similarly v_A = beta_A c.

Let me define beta_p = v_p / c, beta_A = v_A / c.

Then, equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A (beta_A c) = gamma m_p (beta_p c).

Divide both sides by c:

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma m_p beta_p.

But from equation 2:

gamma_A = (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A).

Substitute into the equation:

4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A) ] * beta_A = gamma m_p beta_p.

Simplify:

(1 + gamma) m_p beta_A / m_A = gamma m_p beta_p.

Cancel m_p:

(1 + gamma) beta_A / m_A = gamma beta_p.

Now, solving for beta_p:

beta_p = [ (1 + gamma) beta_A ] / (gamma m_A ) * m_A? Wait, no.

Wait, let me re-express:

(1 + gamma) beta_A / m_A = gamma beta_p.

So,

beta_p = (1 + gamma) beta_A / (gamma m_A) * (1/m_A?) No, because m_A is in the denominator.

Wait, let me see:

(1 + gamma) beta_A = gamma m_A beta_p.

So,

beta_p = (1 + gamma) beta_A / (gamma m_A )

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to consider that the antiproton is moving at beta_p, and then find beta_A in terms of beta_p.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to make another substitution. Let me write gamma in terms of beta_p.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p²).

So, perhaps I can write everything in terms of beta_p.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can make another assumption. Let me suppose that the velocity of A is much less than c, so gamma_A ≈ 1 + (v_A²)/(2 c²). But wait, earlier when I took gamma ≈ 1, got gamma_A ≈ 1.5635, which means beta_A is about 0.77c. So, not non-relativistic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the A particles moving at a certain beta, perhaps 0.9c or something, making gamma around 2.29.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me take the initial energy and set it equal to the final energy.

E_initial = E_final.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

m_p (1 + gamma) = 4 m_A gamma_A.

But m_p is about 3.127 m_A, as I calculated earlier. So,

3.127 m_A (1 + gamma) = 4 m_A gamma_A.

Cancel m_A:

3.127 (1 + gamma) = 4 gamma_A.

So,

gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + gamma)] / 4.

Now, from equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_p.

Express v_p in terms of beta_p: v_p = beta_p c.

v_A = beta_A c.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A (beta_A c) = gamma m_p (beta_p c).

Cancel c:

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma m_p beta_p.

Express m_p as 3.127 m_A:

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma *3.127 m_A beta_p.

Cancel m_A:

4 gamma_A beta_A = 3.127 gamma beta_p.

Now, substitute gamma_A from earlier:

gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + gamma)] / 4.

So,

4 * [3.127 (1 + gamma) /4 ] * beta_A = 3.127 gamma beta_p.

Simplify:

3.127 (1 + gamma) beta_A = 3.127 gamma beta_p.

Cancel 3.127:

(1 + gamma) beta_A = gamma beta_p.

So,

beta_p = [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] beta_A.

Hmm. Let me express beta_p as (1 + gamma)/(gamma) beta_A.

But beta_p is a value between 0 and 1, so [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] beta_A must also be less than 1.

Wait, but gamma is greater than 1, since it's the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's motion. Let me think in terms of gamma and beta_p.

We have:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p²).

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p²).

But again, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma. Let me let gamma be the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.

So,

gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + gamma)] /4.

From equation 1,

4 gamma_A beta_A = 3.127 gamma beta_p.

But we have beta_p = [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] beta_A.

Substituting beta_p into the equation:

4 gamma_A beta_A = 3.127 gamma [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] beta_A.

Wait, the beta_A terms cancel out (assuming beta_A ≠ 0), so:

4 gamma_A = 3.127 (1 + gamma).

Which brings us back to the earlier equation. So that doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can combine the two equations.

Wait, perhaps I should make an assumption for beta_p. Let me suppose that the antiproton is moving at a non-relativistic speed, so gamma ≈ 1.

Then, from equation:

gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + 1) ] /4 = (3.127 * 2)/4 = 6.254/4 ≈ 1.5635.

Then, as before, gamma_A = 1.5635.

So, beta_A = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A^2)).

Wait, beta_A = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma_A^2))).

gamma_A squared is about (1.5635)^2 ≈ 2.444.

So,

beta_A = sqrt(1 - 1/2.444) = sqrt(1 - 0.409) = sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769 c.

Which is approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

But earlier, when I made the approximation that gamma = 1, that's because the antiproton is moving slowly. But if the velocity of A is about 0.77c, which is significant, then the approximation that gamma ≈ 1 might not hold. So perhaps I need to include higher-order terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not make the gamma ≈1 approximation and instead solve for gamma.

Let me try that. Let me denote gamma as the Lorentz factor of the antiproton.

From earlier:

gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + gamma)] /4.

And from equation,

beta_p = [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] beta_A.

But beta_A = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2).

So,

beta_p = [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127 (1 + gamma))]^2 )

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can set up an equation in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write beta_p in terms of gamma and then relate it to gamma.

But this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe it's better to proceed with the initial approximation, since the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, implying that gamma is close to 1. So, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable, leading to beta_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which matches our initial approximation. But another way, I should perhaps check if the velocity is higher, say around 0.9c, which would imply a higher gamma. Let me see.

Suppose that particle A is moving at 0.9c, so gamma_A is about 2.294.

Then, from equation:

gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + gamma)] /4.

So,

2.294 ≈ [3.127 (1 + gamma)] /4.

Multiply both sides by 4: 9.176 ≈3.127 (1 + gamma).

Divide by 3.127: 9.176 /3.127 ≈ 2.935 ≈1 + gamma.

So gamma ≈ 1.935.

Gamma = 1.935 implies beta_p = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.935)^2)).

Calculate 1.935 squared: approx 3.745.

So,

1 - (1/3.745) ≈ 1 - 0.267 ≈ 0.733.

So beta_p = sqrt(0.733) ≈ 0.856 c.

Which is a significant speed, but higher than the initial assumption of non-relativistic. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, which might imply a lower beta_p, so gamma ≈1. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to make no approximation and solve the equations.

Let me write down the two equations again:

1. (1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A → equation A.

2. 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma m_p beta_p → equation B.

From equation A, gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma) m_p ) / (4 m_A )

Substituting into equation B:

4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A) ] * m_A beta_A = gamma m_p beta_p.

Simplify:

(1 + gamma) m_p beta_A = gamma m_p beta_p.

Cancel m_p:

(1 + gamma) beta_A = gamma beta_p.

So,

beta_p = [ (1 + gamma) / gamma ] beta_A.

But beta_A is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2), which from equation A is:

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma) m_p )/(4 m_A )

But m_p = 3.127 m_A, so:

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma) *3.127 m_A ) / (4 m_A ) → gamma_A = [3.127 (1 + gamma)] /4.

So,

beta_A = sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127 (1 + gamma))]^2 )

Substituting beta_A into the equation for beta_p:

beta_p = [ (1 + gamma)/gamma ] * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127 (1 + gamma))]^2 )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can write it in terms of gamma only.

Let me denote x = gamma.

Then,

beta_p = ( (1 + x)/x ) * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127 (1 + x))]^2 )

But beta_p must be less than 1. So,

( (1 + x)/x ) * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127 (1 + x))]^2 ) < 1.

This is a transcendental equation, which might be difficult to solve algebraically. Perhaps I can make an assumption for x and see if it holds.

Let me try x=2.

Then,

( (3)/2 ) * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127*3)]^2 )

Calculate denominator: 3.127 *3 ≈9.38.

4 /9.38 ≈0.426.

So,

[4/(3.127*(1+2))]^2 = (0.426)^2 ≈0.181.

So,

sqrt(1 - 0.181) = sqrt(0.819) ≈0.905.

Now,

(3/2) * 0.905 ≈1.357, which is greater than 1. So, beta_p would be 1.357, which is impossible. So x=2 is too big.

Let me try x=1.5.

Then,

(2.5/1.5) * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127*2.5)]^2 )

Compute denominator: 3.127 *2.5 ≈7.8175.

4 /7.8175 ≈0.5118.

(0.5118)^2 ≈0.262.

So,

sqrt(1 -0.262) = sqrt(0.738) ≈0.859.

Multiply by (2.5/1.5)=1.6667:

1.6667 * 0.859 ≈1.432, which is still greater than 1. So beta_p would be 1.432, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps x=1.3.

Then,

(2.3/1.3) * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127*2.3)]^2 )

Compute denominator: 3.127 *2.3 ≈7.192.

4/7.192≈0.556.

(0.556)^2≈0.309.

sqrt(1-0.309)=sqrt(0.691)=0.831.

Multiply by (2.3/1.3)=1.769.

1.769 *0.831≈1.470. Still too big.

Hmm, perhaps x=1.2.

Then,

(2.2/1.2) * sqrt(1 - [4/(3.127*2.2)]² )

Denominator:3.127 *2.2≈6.879.

4/6.879≈0.581.

(0.581)^2≈0.337.

sqrt(0.663)=0.814.

Multiply by (2.2/1.2)=1.833.

1.833 *0.814≈1.492. Still over 1.

Maybe x=1.1.

Compute:

(2.1/1.1) = ~1.909.

Denominator: 3.127 *2.1 ≈6.566.

4/6.566≈0.609.

(0.609)^2≈0.371.

sqrt(1-0.371)=sqrt(0.629)=0.793.

Multiply: 1.909 *0.793≈1.517. Still over 1.

Hmm, perhaps x=1.05.

(2.05/1.05)=~1.952.

Denominator:3.127*2.05≈6.407.

4/6.407≈0.624.

(0.624)^2≈0.389.

sqrt(0.611)=~0.782.

Multiply:1.952 *0.782≈1.526. Still over 1.

Hmm, perhaps x=1.0.

Then:

(2/1)=2.

Denominator:3.127*2=6.254.

4/6.254≈0.64.

(0.64)^2=0.4096.

sqrt(1-0.4096)=sqrt(0.5904)=~0.768.

Multiply by 2: 1.536>1. So still over.

But beta_p can't be more than 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the velocities are such that the momenta and energies balance without making beta_p exceed 1. Maybe I should instead consider that beta_p is much less than 1, which would require gamma to be close to 1. Let me go back to the initial approximation, then.

In the initial approach, we found beta_A≈0.77c. Let me check the options and see if that's one of them. Yes, option A is 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C which is 0.91c, but my initial approximation gave 0.77c.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine that.

In the initial approach, I assumed that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, leading to 4 p_A = p_initial. Then, using energy and momentum conservation, I found beta_A≈0.77c.

But perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let me think about the production of two A+ and two A- particles. Perhaps each A+ and A- are produced in pairs, so their momenta could cancel.

Wait, but the initial system's momentum is not zero, so the four particles must have a net momentum equal to that. So, perhaps the two A+ and two A- are produced such that each pair's momentum adds up to half the initial momentum.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each pair (A+ and A-) is moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel, but in such a way that the total momentum is equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps each pair contributes a net momentum of p_initial/2, so that two such pairs would give a total of p_initial.

Hmm, but this is getting too speculative. Perhaps the intended approach is the initial one, leading to option A, 0.77c.

Alternatively, let me think about the invariant mass approach. The invariant mass squared (s) is equal to the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the conservation of energy and momentum without considering the directions of the particles, assuming all four have the same speed and direction.

But given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll proceed with the initial conclusion that the velocity is approximately 0.77c, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is stated to be moving slowly, suggesting a non-relativistic approximation may be valid. The mass of particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \), and the proton mass is approximately \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Assumptions and Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_p^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.  

   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four \( A \)-particles:  
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles.

   Equating the initial and final energies:  
   \[
   (1 + \gamma) m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The initial momentum is due to the antiproton:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p v_p.
   \]  
   Assuming the \( A \)-particles move symmetrically, their total momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A.
   \]  
   Equating the initial and final momenta:  
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma m_p v_p.
   \]

### Solving for \( \gamma_A \) and \( v_A \):
From energy conservation:  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma) m_p}{4 m_A}.
\]  
Substituting \( m_p \approx 3.127 m_A \) (since \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \)):  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma) \cdot 3.127 m_A}{4 m_A} = \frac{3.127 (1 + \gamma)}{4}.
\]

From momentum conservation:  
\[
v_A = \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} v_p.
\]  
Substituting \( \gamma_A \) into the equation for \( \gamma_A \):  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{3.127 (1 + \gamma)}{4}.
\]  
Assuming the antiproton is moving slowly (\( \gamma \approx 1 \)), we find:  
\[
\gamma_A \approx \frac{3.127 \cdot 2}{4} = 1.5635.
\]

Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_A \):  
\[
v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
\]  
Substituting \( \gamma_A = 1.5635 \):  
\[
v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5635)^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - 0.409} = c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77c.
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to option **A**.
