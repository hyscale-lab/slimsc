Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds. So, there are two C=C bonds. Wait, maybe I should count all the bonds in the molecule because the question gives bond energies.

The problem provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make it into individual atoms. So for carbon, that's probably the energy to break all the bonds in its elemental form, which is graphite or diamond. But I'm not sure if that's needed here. Maybe I'll come back to that.

The bond energies given are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to calculate the total bond energies of the compound and relate it to the elements.

The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

But wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Or maybe I should think about the formation as building the molecule from its constituent atoms, so the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies required to break bonds in the reactants minus the energies released when forming bonds in the product.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies in the reactants) - (sum of bond energies in the product)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When a molecule is formed from its atoms, it's the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the energy released when the bonds form in the product.

Wait, for example, if the reaction is C (graphite) + H2 → CH4, the enthalpy change would be sum of bond energies of reactants (C-C and H-H) minus sum of bond energies in product (C-H bonds). But wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. The standard approach is: 

The standard enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. 

The formula is often written using the heats of atomization (which is the energy to break all bonds in the compound into individual atoms):

ΔHf° = (Σ Heats of atomization of products) - (Σ Heats of atomization of reactants)

But wait, or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Suppose the reaction is a + b → c. The enthalpy change is (sum of heats of atomization of c) - (sum of heats of atomization of a and b times their stoichiometric coefficients).

Wait, but in this problem, the molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So, for the formation reaction, we have:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → 1 mol of the compound.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf° = [n * (heat of atomization of C) + m * (heat of atomization of H2)] - [sum of bond energies in the compound]

Wait, no, because forming the molecule releases energy. So:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies in the molecule] - [sum of bond energies in the reactants]

Wait, maybe I should think about it as:

The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (reactants) to form the compound, minus the energy released when the compound's bonds form.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The standard approach is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies in the reactants) - (sum of bond energies in the product)

Wait, no. Let's think about it. If I have a reaction where elements combine to form a compound, the energy released is the sum of bond energies of the product minus the sum of bond energies of the reactants.

Wait, that would mean that enthalpy of formation would be negative if the reaction is exothermic, which is correct. So, the formula should be:

ΔHf° = sum (bond energies in reactants) - sum (bond energies in product)

Wait, wait. Let me think in terms of bond energies. Breaking bonds requires energy, and forming bonds releases energy. So, if the reaction is exothermic, the product has stronger bonds. So, the energy change is energy required to break reactant bonds minus energy released when forming product bonds.

So, for the formation reaction:

Reactants → Products

ΔH = sum (reactant bonds broken) - sum (product bonds formed)

But that's for the overall process. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for this reaction.

So, for the formation of the compound from its elements, the enthalpy of formation would be:

sum (bond energies of reactants) - sum (bond energies of product)

But wait, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. For carbon, that's graphite, which has a certain bond energy. For hydrogen, it's H2 gas.

So, for this problem:

The compound is made up of C and H. The reactants are C (graphite) and H2.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms) * (heat of atomization of C) ) + (number of H atoms / 2) * (heat of atomization of H2) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, no, because the heat of atomization is the energy needed to break all bonds in an element to make individual atoms. So, for the reaction, you have to break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) to get individual atoms, and then form the bonds in the product (the compound).

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

[Heat of atomization of C × moles of C] + [Heat of atomization of H2 × moles of H2] - [Sum of bond energies in the product]

Wait, but the bond energies in the product (the molecule) are the bonds that are formed. So, when the molecule forms, it releases energy equal to the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

So, the overall enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bonds formed in product]

In this case, the reactants are C (graphite) and H2. Each C in graphite has C-C bonds, so the heat of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol as given. Each H2 has H-H bonds.

Wait, but wait. The heat of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in the element to form individual atoms. So for C in graphite, the heat of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. For H2, the heat of atomization is 100 kJ/mol (because bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol given).

So, for each mole of C, you need 1000 kJ to break into atoms. For each mole of H2, you need 100 kJ to break into H atoms.

Then, when you form the molecule, you form all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule. Each bond contributes its bond energy as the energy released.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (moles of C × 1000) + (moles of H2 × 50 × 100) ] - [ (sum of bond energies in the molecule) ]

Wait, wait. Moles of H2 is equal to (number of H atoms) / 2, because each H2 has two H atoms. So, if the molecule has x H atoms, then moles of H2 is x/2.

Wait, but to get the atoms, you need to break the H2 into 2H per molecule, so each H2 contributes 100 kJ to break into two H atoms.

Wait, no. The bond energy is per mole. So, the bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. So, for each mole of H2, you need 100 kJ to break into two moles of H atoms.

So, if the molecule has, say, y H atoms, then the number of moles of H2 needed is y/2.

So, the heat of atomization for H2 would be (y/2) * 100 kJ.

Similarly, the number of moles of C is the number of C atoms in the molecule. Let's call that n_C.

So, heat of atomization for C is n_C * 1000 kJ.

Then, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is the sum of all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the compound.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C * 1000) + (n_H / 2 * 100) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, but wait. The bond energies in the molecule are the bonds that are formed. So, for each C-C bond, the bond energy is 200 kJ/mol. When the molecule forms, those bonds are formed, releasing energy. So, the sum of the bond energies is the total energy released.

So, the calculation is:

ΔHf° = (energy required to break reactants into atoms) - (energy released when forming product bonds)

Which is:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C * 1000) + (n_H / 2 * 100) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds * 200) + (number of C=C bonds * 300) + (number of C-H bonds * 400) ) ]

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. All bond energies are given per mole, so I need to calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

So, first, let's count the number of each type of bond in the given molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write it out step by step.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-

So, that's:

CH3-C(CH3)=CH-

So, that's a central C connected to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to a CH. So, in this part:

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see, each CH3 has a C-C bond with the central C. Wait, no. Each CH3 is a methyl group attached to the central C. So, each CH3 has one C-C bond (each CH3 is connected via a single bond to the central C). So, in (CH3)2C, there are two C-C bonds (each CH3 contributes one).

Then, the central C is double-bonded to a CH. So, that's one C=C bond.

Then, the next part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the structure continues as:

...CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, let's count all the bonds.

First, let's count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   - Each (CH3) has 3 C-H bonds. So, two CH3 groups have 2 * 3 = 6 C-H bonds.
   - The central C has two C-C bonds (each connected to CH3 groups) → 2 C-C bonds.
   - The central C is double-bonded to a CH → 1 C=C bond.
   - The CH has 3 C-H bonds? Wait, CH has one C-H bond, or more? Let me think. No, the group is CH, so it's CH2? Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-...

Wait, the structure might be better represented as:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let me break it down:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → This is a double bond between the central C (which is attached to two CH3 groups) and a CH group.

   - So, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups (each via single C-C bonds) → 2 C-C bonds.
   - The central C is double-bonded to the CH → 1 C=C bond.
   - The CH has one C-H bond, but wait, the CH is connected to the next part as CH-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps each CH group has one C-H bond. Let me think about each part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the bonds in the entire molecule.

Let me count each type:

C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

Looking at the structure:

1. (CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, let's list each C-C bond:

- The central C (let's say C1) in (CH3)2C is connected to two CH3 groups (C1-C2 and C1-C3, where C2 and C3 are each CH3 carbons).
- C1 is double-bonded to C4 (the CH group: C4 is connected to C1 via double bond, and to C5 via single bond (C4-C5: CH-CH2...).
- C5 is connected to C4 via single bond (CH2- group), so C4-C5 is a C-C bond.
- C5 is connected to C6 (CH(CH3)), so C5-C6 is another C-C bond.
- C6 is connected to C5, then to C7 (CH2), and C6 has a CH3 group attached (so C6-C7? No, C6 is CH(CH3), so connected to C5, C7, and CH3).
Wait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled. Let me approach this methodically.

Alternative approach: Each group contributes certain bonds.

1. The molecule is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C-C bonds:

Each single bond is a C-C.

- In (CH3)2C, each CH3 contributes one C-C bond with the central C. So, 2 C-C bonds.
- The central C is double-bonded to the next C (so no single bond there; it's a double bond, so not a C-C bond).
- The next C (let's say C4) is connected to C5 via single bond (CH2-CH...).
   So, C4-C5 is another C-C bond.
- C5 is connected to C6 (CH(CH3)) → another C-C bond (C5-C6).
- C6 is connected to C7 (CH2-) → another C-C bond (C6-C7).
- C7 is connected to C8 (CH=...).
   So, C7-C8 → another C-C bond.
- C8 is connected to C9 (the other C in the double bond). So, C8-C9 is a double bond (C=C), so no single bond there.
- Additionally, in the ends, perhaps there are more C-C bonds.

Wait, maybe I should count each single bond between two carbons.

Let me try:

Each single bond is a C-C.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, the chain is:

C1 (from (CH3)2C) = C2 (the CH group) – C3 (CH2) – C4 (CH(CH3)) – C5 (CH2) – C6 (CH=C(CH3)2)

Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons:

1. C1: attached to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to C2.

2. C2: double-bonded to C1 and single-bonded to C3.

3. C3: single-bonded to C2 and C4.

4. C4: single-bonded to C3 and C5, plus a CH3 attached.

5. C5: single-bonded to C4 and C6.

6. C6: single-bonded to C5 and C7, and has a double bond to C7.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is: C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

So, the connections are:

C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

Each '-' represents a single bond.

So, the C-C bonds are:

C1-C2: no, because it's a double bond. So no single C-C bond there.

C2-C3: single bond → 1 C-C.

C3-C4: single bond → 1 C-C.

C4-C5: single bond → 1 C-C.

C5-C6: single bond → 1 C-C.

C6-C7: no, it's a double bond → no single C-C bond.

So, in the main chain, there are 4 C-C bonds.

Wait, but each CH3 group is connected via single bonds. Let's see:

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

C2 is connected to one CH (from the CH group) → which is a C-H bond, but that's not a C-C bond.

C3 is connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, no. C3 is CH2, so it's connected to C2 and C4, and two H's.

So, already, I'm getting confused. Let's perhaps count all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: The central C (C1) is connected to two CH3 groups (C-C bonds) → 2.

2. The double bond C1=C2: not a C-C bond.

3. Then C2 is connected to C3 via single bond → another C-C bond.

4. C3 is connected to C4 → another → total 3.

5. C4 is connected to C5 → total 4.

6. C5 is connected to C6 → 5.

7. C6 is connected to C7 via double bond (C6=C7) → no C-C bond.

8. Additionally, C7 is connected to two CH3 groups → each is a C-C bond. So, 2 more → total 7.

So, total C-C bonds: 7.

Wait, let me recount:

- C1 has two C-C bonds (to two CH3 groups) → 2.

- C2 connected to C3 → 1 → total 3.

- C3 connected to C4 → 1 → 4.

- C4 connected to C5 → 1 →5.

- C5 connected to C6 →1 →6.

- C6 connected to two CH3 groups (so two more C-C bonds) → 8.

Wait, because C6 is double-bonded to C7. So, C6 is connected to C7 via double bond (no single C-C), but C6 has two CH3 groups attached → that's two C-C bonds.

So, yes, 8 C-C bonds in total.

Wait, but let me think again. Each CH3 group is a single C-C bond. So, for C1, two CH3 → 2 C-C bonds.

For C6, two CH3 → 2 more → 2+2=4.

Then, in the main chain, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 → that's four more → total 8.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the main chain had five C-C bonds (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7?), but wait, C6 is connected to C7 via double bond, so no C-C bond there.

So, main chain C-C bonds: 4.

So, 4 (main chain) + 4 (from CH3 groups) = 8 C-C bonds.

But wait, each CH3 is a separate C-C bond. So, for each CH3 attached to any C, it's one C-C bond. Let's count all CH3 groups.

Looking at the molecule:

- (CH3)2 → two CH3 groups → 2 C-C bonds.

- CH(CH3) → one CH3 → 1 C-C.

- CH=C(CH3)2 → two CH3 groups → 2 C-C bonds.

So, total CH3 groups: 2 (from first part) + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 (from last part) → 5 CH3 groups.

Each contributes one C-C bond → 5 C-C bonds.

In the main chain, how many C-C bonds?

Looking at the main chain:

C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

So, C2-C3 is a bond → 1.

C3-C4 → another → 2.

C4-C5 → 3.

C5-C6 →4.

Wait, that's four C-C bonds in the main chain.

So total C-C bonds: 5 (from CH3) +4 (main chain) =9? No, wait, perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, no. The CH3 groups are attached to certain Cs, each contributing one C-C bond. The main chain's C-C bonds are the ones between the Cs in the chain.

So, structure:

C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

C1 has two CH3 → 2 C-C bonds.

C2 is connected to C3 →1→ total 3.

C3 connected to C4 →4.

C4 connected to C5 →5.

C5 connected to C6 →6.

C6 has two CH3 → 2 more → total 8.

So, 8 C-C bonds in total.

Now, what about C=C bonds?

The molecule has two double bonds: C1=C2 and C6=C7.

So, two C=C bonds.

Now, the C-H bonds.

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. Let's count all CH3 groups.

As before, there are 2 (from C1), 1 (from C4), and 2 (from C7) → total 5 CH3 groups. Each has 3 → 5 *3 =15 C-H bonds.

Then, other C-H groups:

Looking at the structure, there are some CH groups.

For example, the C2 is part of CH (from =CH-). So, that's one C-H bond.

Similarly, the C3 is part of CH2, which has two C-H bonds.

Wait, let's go step by step.

Each carbon in the molecule:

- C1: (CH3)2C= → So, C1 is connected to two CH3, and double-bonded to C2. So, no H attached to C1.

- C2: =CH- → So, C2 has one H attached (since it's CH), so one C-H bond.

- C3: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

- C4: CH(CH3) → that's one H attached (since it's CH, not CH2 or CH3), so one C-H bond.

- C5: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

- C6: double-bonded to C7, and connected to two CH3 groups. So, no H attached to C6.

- C7: =C(CH3)2 → no H attached.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount the C-H bonds:

1. C1: no H.

2. C2: CH → 1 H.

3. C3: CH2 → 2 H.

4. C4: CH → 1 H.

5. C5: CH2 → 2 H.

6. C6: no H.

7. C7: no H.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups:

- C1: 2 → 2 *3 =6.

- C4: 1 →3.

- C7: 2 →6.

Total H in CH3 groups:6 +3 +6 =15.

Other H groups:

C2:1, C3:2, C4:1, C5:2. So 1+2+1+2=6.

Total C-H bonds:15 (from CH3) +6 (from other CH groups) =21.

Wait, wait, each C-H is a single bond, so each contributes one bond. So, 21 C-H bonds.

So, now putting it all together:

C-C bonds: 8 → each is 200 kJ/mol → 8 *200 =1600 kJ.

C=C bonds:2 → each 300 → 2 *300 =600 kJ.

C-H bonds:21 → each 400 → 21 *400 =8400 kJ.

So, sum of bond energies in the molecule =1600 +600 +8400 =10600 kJ.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The bond energies are per mole. So, each bond contributes its energy. So, for 8 C-C bonds, it's 8 *200 kJ. But wait, that's 1600 kJ for all 8 bonds.

Wait no, no. Wait, the bond energies are given per mole. So, each mole of C-C bond has 200 kJ. If I have 8 C-C bonds in one mole of the molecule, then the total energy for C-C is 8 *200=1600 kJ.

Similarly for C=C: 2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

So, sum is 1600 +600 +8400 =10600 kJ.

Now, the reactants are C and H2.

The number of C atoms in the molecule:

Looking at the formula, it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 contributes 2 CH3 groups, each CH3 has 1 C. So, the molecule has:

- Each (CH3)2: 2 C.

- The central C in (CH3)2C: 1 C.

- Then, the next C in =CH-: 1.

- CH2-: another C → so far, 2+1+1+1=5?

Wait, perhaps better to count each carbon.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count all carbons:

- (CH3)2C : 3 C (two CH3 and one central C).

- =CH- : 1 C.

- CH2- :1 C.

- CH(CH3) :1 C.

- CH2- :1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the CH and the C connected to two CH3).

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try:

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C= → 3 C (two CH3 and one C).

2. =CH- → 1 C.

3. -CH2- → 1 C.

4. -CH(CH3)- →1 C.

5. -CH2- →1 C.

6. -CH=C(CH3)2 →2 C (the CH and the C with two CH3).

So, 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +2 =9 C atoms in total.

So, n_C =9.

n_H: Let's count the H atoms.

Each CH3 group has 3 H.

Earlier, we thought there are 5 CH3 groups: let me recount.

- (CH3)2C: 2 CH3 → 2 *3 =6 H.

- =CH-: 1 H.

- CH2-: 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 CH3 → 3 H, but the CH has 1 H → so CH(CH3) has 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4 H.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

=CH-: the CH has 1 H.

Each CH2 has 2 H.

Each C in CH(CH3) has 1 H (since it's CH) plus the 3 from CH3.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count every H in the molecule.

Let's go step by step.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C: two CH3 groups (each 3 H) → 2*3=6 H.

The C in (CH3)2C is connected to =CH-, which is CH.

So, CH has 1 H.

Then, -CH2-: 2 H.

Then, -CH(CH3): the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H → total 4 H.

Next, -CH2-: 2 H.

Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C=C has the other C connected to two CH3 (each 3 H) → 2*3=6 H.

Wait, no. The structure is CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C on the left (CH) has 1 H.

The C on the right (C(CH3)2) has no H attached (since it's connected to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to the other C).

So, the H count from CH=C(CH3)2 is 1 (from CH) + 0 (from C(CH3)2) → 1 H.

Wait, but the CH3 groups each have 3 H.

So, putting it all together:

H from (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Two CH3:6 H.

- CH:1 H.

So, 7 H.

Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH2:2 H.

- CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 → total 4 H.

- CH2:2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and two CH3 groups: 2*3=6 H.

So, adding up:

6 (from first CH3) +1 (CH) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH) +6 (CH3 from C=C) → 6+1=7; 7+2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22.

Wait, that makes 22 H atoms.

Wait, but let's recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   - 2 CH3: 6 H.

   - CH:1 H.

   → 6+1=7.

2. -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:

   a. CH2:2 H → total 9.

   b. CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 →4 → total 13.

   c. CH2:2 →15.

   d. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H; the C=C has two CH3 groups → 3*2=6 H → total 1+6=7 H.

   So, adding d → 15 +7 =22.

So, total H atoms:22.

But wait, each CH3 in the C=C part: there are two CH3 groups attached to the C on the right of the double bond. Each contributes 3 H → 2*3=6 H. Plus the CH on the left contributes 1 H → total 7 H from the last part.

So, overall, 22 H atoms.

Wait, but in the earlier count, I thought each CH3 contributes 3 H, and other groups contribute based on their structure.

So, with 22 H atoms, the number of moles of H2 needed is 22 / 2 =11 moles.

So, n_H =22 → n_H/2 =11.

Now, putting it all into the formula.

ΔHf° = [ (n_C * 1000) + (n_H/2 * 100) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

n_C is 9 → 9 *1000 =9000 kJ.

n_H is 22 →22/2=11 →11 *100=1100 kJ.

So, sum of reactant bond energies:9000 +1100=10100 kJ.

Sum of product bond energies:10600 kJ.

So, ΔHf°=10100 -10600 =-500 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that gives a negative value, which would imply the reaction is exothermic.

But looking at the options, I don’t see any negative options. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me recheck the numbers.

n_C: earlier thought 9? Let me recount the carbons in the molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C= → 3 C (two CH3 and one central C).

- =CH- → 1 C.

- CH2- →1 C.

- CH(CH3)- →1 C.

- CH2- →1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2 → 2 C (CH and the C with two CH3).

So, 3+1+1+1+1+2=9 C → correct.

n_C=9 → 9 *1000=9000 kJ.

n_H=22 →11 moles of H2 →11 *100=1100 kJ.

So, reactant bond energies:9000 +1100=10100.

Product bond energies:8 C-C (each 200), 2 C=C (each 300), 21 C-H (each 400).

So,

C-C:8 *200=1600.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

Sum:1600+600=2200; 2200+8400=10600.

So, 10600.

ΔHf°=10100 -10600 =-500 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have negative numbers. So, perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility is that the formula is reversed. Maybe the product bond energies are subtracted from the reactant bond energies.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies in product - sum of bond energies in reactants.

Which would give 10600 -10100=500 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, 500 isn't present. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the given bond energies are bond energies for breaking. So, when you form bonds, you release energy. So, the total bond energy in the product is the energy released, which is subtracted from the energy used to break the reactant bonds.

So, the correct formula is ΔHf° = (reactant bond energies) - (product bond energies).

Which would be 10100 -10600= -500.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of bonds.

Let me check the counts again.

C-C bonds: did I count 8 correctly?

Each CH3 contributes one C-C bond.

In the molecule, the CH3 groups are:

- Two from (CH3)2C → 2.

- One from CH(CH3) →1.

- Two from C=C(CH3)2 →2.

So, that's 5 CH3 groups →5 C-C bonds.

In the main chain:

C2-C3 is single →1.

C3-C4 →1.

C4-C5 →1.

C5-C6 →1.

That's four.

So, 5+4=9. Oh wait, earlier I thought 8, but perhaps it's 9.

Wait, so C-C bonds:9.

If that's the case, 9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

So, sum product bonds:1800 +600 +8400=10800.

Then, ΔHf° =10100 -10800= -700.

But again, not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me count again:

Each CH3 group contributes one C-C bond.

Number of CH3 groups:

Looking at the molecule:

- Two from (CH3)2C →2.

- One from CH(CH3) →1.

- Two from C(CH3)2 →2.

Total 5 CH3 →5 C-C.

In the main chain:

C2 connected to C3 →1.

C3 connected to C4 →2.

C4 connected to C5 →3.

C5 connected to C6 →4.

C6 connected to C7 →5, but it's a double bond, so no single C-C.

So, four C-C in the main chain.

Total C-C:5 (from CH3) +4 (main) =9.

So, product bond energies:9*200=1800, 2*300=600, 21*400=8400 → sum 1800+600=2400 +8400=10800.

So, ΔHf°=10100 -10800= -700 kJ/mol.

Still no matching option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the sum of bond energies in the reactants minus sum in the product, but the product is the molecule, which is 1 mole, while the reactants may be in different amounts.

Wait, let me think of the reaction.

The reaction is:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → 1 mol of the compound.

So, the bond energies are on a per mole basis.

So, the moles of C is 9 (as per the molecule), and moles of H2 is 22/2=11.

So, the bond energies for reactants are:

9 * (heat of atomization of C) =9 *1000=9000.

11 * (heat of atomization of H2)=11 *100=1100.

Total reactant bond energies:10100.

Product bond energies: sum of all bond energies in the molecule →10800 (assuming 9 C-C bonds).

So, ΔHf°=10100 -10800= -700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, could the problem be asking for enthalpy of formation per mole, but I'm using per molecule?

No, the problem states 'given' bond energies are per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the formation from elements, but from another source. Or perhaps I need to use a different approach.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the formula:

ΔHf° = (Σ [number of bonds × bond energy]) for reactants - (Σ [number of bonds × bond energy]) for products.

Wait, no, that would be for a reaction where the reactants and products are broken down into elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants)] - [Σ (bonds formed in products)].

Wait, but if the reaction is making a molecule from elements, then the bonds broken in reactants are the bonds in the elements (C and H2), and bonds formed are the bonds in the product (the molecule).

So, the correct formula would be:

ΔHf° = (bond energies of C and H2) - (bond energies of the molecule).

Wait, but earlier calculation gives that as 10100 -10800= -700.

But the options given don't include -700.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds and C-H bonds.

Let me recount the number of C-C bonds again.

Each CH3 contributes a C-C bond.

Total CH3 groups:5 →5 C-C.

Main chain:

C2-C3 →1.

C3-C4 →2.

C4-C5 →3.

C5-C6 →4.

C6-C7 → no, double bond.

So, 4 C-C in the main chain.

Total C-C bonds:5+4=9.

So, 9 ×200=1800.

C=C bonds:2 ×300=600.

C-H bonds:21 ×400=8400.

Sum:1800+600=2400 +8400=10800.

So, product bond energy:10800.

Reactant bond energy:9000+1100=10100.

ΔHf°=10100-10800= -700.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bond energies given are in kJ per bond, not per mole. But no, the question says "Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol".

So, the given bond energies are per mole, not per bond.

So, each mole of C-C bonds contributes 200 kJ.

Thus, for 9 moles of C-C bonds, it's 9×200=1800.

Same for other bonds.

Wait, but the molecule is one mole. So, each bond in the molecule is present in one mole of the compound.

So, the sum is per mole.

So, the calculation seems correct.

But the options don't have -700, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement.

Oh, wait! The question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation" but perhaps it's considering only the bonds broken and formed in the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy of formation being the sum of the bond energies of the elements minus the sum of the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, but that would be the same as what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of formation as the energy released when the molecule is formed, which would be the negative of what I calculated.

So, if the molecule releases energy when formed, the enthalpy of formation is negative. But the options don't have negative values.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe it's using the formula:

ΔHf° = sum (elements' bond energies) - sum (molecule's bond energies).

Which would be 10100 -10800= -700.

But, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute value? Or perhaps it's a positive value because the question is about the energy required.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds.

Let me recount the C-H bonds.

Earlier, I thought there were 21 C-H bonds.

But perhaps the structure has more or fewer.

Let me think again.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds.

Number of CH3 groups:5 →5 ×3=15.

Other C-H bonds:

C2: CH →1.

C3: CH2 →2.

C4: CH →1.

C5: CH2 →2.

C6: no.

C7: no.

So, 1+2+1+2=6.

Total C-H:15+6=21.

Yes, that's correct.

So, that's 21 C-H bonds.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated using only the single bonds, not the double bonds. But no, double bonds are included.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of atomization of C as the energy per atom, not per mole. Wait, the given enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So, per mole of C atoms.

But in the calculation, I used 9 moles of C atoms (since the molecule has 9 C atoms) → 9 *1000=9000 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C atoms. So, if the molecule has 9 C atoms, then it's 9 moles of C atoms → 9 *1000=9000.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. The calculation leads to -700 kJ/mol, but that's not an option. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation [...] Given, enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So, units are per mole, but the options include per gram.

So, perhaps the answer is in per gram, which would require knowing the molar mass.

Wait, let's calculate the molar mass of the molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 is 15 g/mol (12 +3*1).

Now, let's count the number of each atom.

Carbon:

Earlier we have 9 C atoms.

Hydrogen:

Earlier count was 22 H atoms.

So, molar mass =9*12 +22*1 →108 +22=130 g/mol.

So, 130 g/mol.

So, if the enthalpy of formation is -700 kJ/mol, then per gram it would be -700 /130 ≈ -5.38 kJ/g.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, but the options C and D are in kJ/g. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, D is 1900 kJ/g, which seems too high.

But I don't see any of these matching -5.38.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the actual ΔHf is positive 700, which would mean the question is looking for the magnitude.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of combustion or something else. But no, the question is about formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go step by step again.

Total C-C bonds:9 →9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 →2*300=600.

C-H:21 →21*400=8400.

Sum:1800+600=2400 +8400=10800.

Reactant bond energies:9000 (C) +1100 (H2) =10100.

ΔHf°=10100 -10800= -700.

So, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options don't include this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has fewer bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each C=C bond is only counted once, but I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies in the product] - [sum of bond energies in the reactants].

Which would be 10800 -10100=700.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is different. Let me re-examine the structure.

The given structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is symmetric. So, perhaps the molecule is 1,7-dimethyl-1,6-diphenylheptene or something, but I don't think that affects the bond count.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the molecule has more C-H bonds than I thought.

Wait, if I recount C-H bonds, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me recount:

In (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H.

Number of CH3 groups:

- (CH3)2C:2.

- CH(CH3):1.

- CH=C(CH3)2:2.

Total 5 CH3 → 5×3=15.

Other C-H:

C2: CH →1.

C3: CH2 →2.

C4: CH →1.

C5: CH2 →2.

C6: no.

C7: no.

So, 1+2+1+2=6.

Total C-H:15+6=21.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 21 ×400=8400.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of atomization as per atom, not per mole.

Wait, the given is "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So, per mole of C atoms.

So, 9 C atoms →9 moles →9 ×1000=9000 kJ.

But perhaps I should have used kJ per atom.

Wait, 1000 kJ per mole → per atom is 1000 / (6.022e23) ≈ 1.66e-22 kJ/atom.

Which is negligible and wouldn't change the calculation.

So, no. So, I'm not seeing the mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the enthalpy of formation to be positive, so the correct answer isn't present, but the closest option is B) 67.4.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I have a wrong number of H atoms.

Wait, let me recount the H.

Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups:5 →15 H.

Other H:

C2: CH →1.

C3: CH2 →2.

C4: CH →1.

C5: CH2 →2.

C6: no.

C7: no.

So, 1+2+1+2=6.

Total H:15 +6=21.

Wait, 21 H. So, H2 needed is 21/2=10.5 moles. But I used 11 earlier.

Wait, 10.5 ×100=1050.

Ah! I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I used 11 moles of H2, but 21 H atoms mean 10.5 moles of H2.

So, the correct calculation is:

n_C=9 →9×1000=9000.

n_H=21 →21/2=10.5 →10.5 ×100=1050.

So, reactant bond energies:9000 +1050=10050.

Product bond energies:10800.

ΔHf°=10050 -10800= -750.

Still doesn't match any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the H-H bond energy as 432 kJ/mol? But the given is 100 kJ/mol. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered each C=C bond as 615 kJ/mol, but the given is 300.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of enthalpy of formation as the energy released when the molecule is formed, so the absolute value. So, 700 or 750.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 8 C-C bonds, not 9.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

CH3 groups contribute 5 C-C bonds.

Main chain:

C2-C3 →1.

C3-C4 →2.

C4-C5 →3.

C5-C6 →4.

Total:4.

So, 5+4=9.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should only count the single bonds in the molecule.

Wait, the molecule has two double bonds, so each double bond has one less single bond.

So, in the main chain, between C1 and C2, it's a double bond → no single C-C.

Similarly, between C6 and C7, no single C-C.

So, the main chain's C-C bonds are:

C2-C3 →1.

C3-C4 →2.

C4-C5 →3.

C5-C6 →4.

So, 4.

Plus the 5 from CH3 groups →9.

So, 9 C-C bonds.

I think I'm correct.

Perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using the formula for enthalpy of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the atoms minus the bond energies of the molecule.

But that's what I did.

Wait, let me think. Maybe the question is using the enthalpy of formation as the sum of all bond energies in the molecule minus the sum of bond energies in the elements.

So, ΔHf°= sum (product bonds) - sum (reactant bonds).

Which would be 10800 -10050=750.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the energy in kJ/g, not kJ/mol.

If the molar mass is 130 g/mol, then 700 kJ/mol →700/130≈5.38 kJ/g.

But the options have C)11.44 kJ/g and D)1900 kJ/g.

Maybe I made a mistake in molar mass.

Wait, what's the molecular formula of the compound?

The given structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's write the formula.

Each (CH3)2 contributes 2 C and 6 H.

The central C is connected to =CH-: so adds one C and one H.

Then, CH2- adds one C and 2 H.

CH(CH3): adds one C and (1 +3)=4 H.

CH2-: adds one C and 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: adds one C (from CH) and (6 H from two CH3) and one C from the double bond (so two CH3, 6 H).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count C and H.

Total C:

As before, 9.

Total H:

Let me recount.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (from two CH3) +1 (CH)=7 H.

CH2-:2 →9.

CH(CH3):1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =4 →13.

CH2-:2 →15.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 (CH) +6 (from two CH3) →7 →22.

So, 22 H.

So, molecular formula is C9H22.

Molar mass:9×12 +22×1=108+22=130 g/mol.

So, if the ΔHf is -700 kJ/mol, then per gram it's -700 /130 ≈ -5.38 kJ/g.

But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but option B is 67.4 kJ/mol. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the H atoms, leading to a different n_H.

Wait, if the molecule has 20 H atoms, then n_H/2=10 →10 ×100=1000.

So, reactant bond energies:9000+1000=10000.

Product bond energies:10800.

ΔHf=10000 -10800=-800.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 24 H atoms →12 H2 →12 ×100=1200.

So, reactant bond energies:9000+1200=10200.

Product:10800.

ΔHf=10200-10800= -600.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternative approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (number of C atoms × heat of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × ½ × heat of atomization of H2) ) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule).

Which is what I did.

So, perhaps I'm correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Or perhaps there's a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energies in kJ, not per mole.

Wait, the given bond energies are per mole. So, for one mole, it's per mole.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of all bond energies of the elements minus the sum of bond energies of the molecule.

So, that's what I did.

But I'm not seeing any error in that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the bond energies in the molecule as the bonds that are broken, not formed.

Wait, no, because when the molecule is formed, the bonds are formed, releasing energy.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Since none of the calculations match the options, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has only 8 C-C bonds.

If that's the case:

8 ×200=1600.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:21 ×400=8400.

Sum:1600+600=2200 +8400=10600.

Reactant bond energies:9000 +1050=10050.

ΔHf=10050 -10600= -550.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the single bonds and not the double bonds.

Wait, but the double bonds contribute to bond energies as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the bond energies in the molecule, not the formation.

But the question is about enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total bond energy and compare to the options.

Sum of bond energies in molecule:10600 or 10800.

But the options have 11200 as option A.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

If the molecule has 10 C-C bonds:

10 ×200=2000.

C=C:600.

C-H:8400.

Sum:2000+600=2600 +8400=11000.

Then, reactant bond energies:9000 +1050=10050.

ΔHf=10050 -11000= -950.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the product bonds is 11200.

If so, then 11200 -10050=1150. But that's not an option.

Option A is 11200.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of bond energies in the molecule, which is option A.

But that seems unlikely. The question asks for enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is written as ΔHf° = sum (reactant bonds) - sum (product bonds).

Which would be 10050 -10800= -750.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is positive 750, but that's not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use only the single bond energies.

Wait, maybe the double bonds are not counted. But that can't be right, as the problem includes their bond energies.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be -700 kJ/mol, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to provide different bond energies or a different structure.

Given the options, the closest match to a positive value is option B)67.4, but I don't see how that arises from my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H atoms. Let me recount.

Let me write down each H:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

Groups:

1. (CH3)2C: 2 CH3 →6 H.

2. =CH-: 1 H.

3. CH2-:2 H.

4. CH(CH3):1 (CH) +3 (CH3) →4 H.

5. CH2-:2 H.

6. CH=C(CH3)2:1 (CH) +6 (two CH3) →7 H.

Total H:6 +1 +2 +4 +2 +7=22.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I might have to go with the calculation I have, but it's not matching any option. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the product bonds minus the sum of the reactant bonds, leading to 10800 -10050=750.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in grams, but that brings in the molar mass.

If the ΔHf is -700 kJ/mol, and molar mass is 130 g/mol, then per gram it's -700 /130 ≈ -5.38 kJ/g.

But the options have C)11.44 kJ/g and D)1900 kJ/g.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula where each bond contributes its energy to the formation, but only for the new bonds formed.

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies as per bond, not per mole.

Wait, the given bond energies are per mole, so that can't be.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the correct answer isn't among the options. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't figure out how to reach that.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be:

ΔHf°= (sum of bonds in product) - (sum of bonds in reactants) → 10800 -10050=750 →750 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

In conclusion, based on my calculations, the correct answer should be -700 kJ/mol, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake. But I can't find where. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I don't know why.

The problem involves calculating the enthalpy of formation of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` using the provided bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{(Sum of bond energies in reactants)} - \text{(Sum of bond energies in product)}
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Reactants and Bond Energies**:
   - The reactants are carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).
   - The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as **1000 kJ/mol**, and the bond energy of H-H is **100 kJ/mol**.
   - The molecule contains **9 carbon atoms** and **22 hydrogen atoms**:
     - **n_C = 9**, so the energy required to break the bonds in carbon is \( 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ} \).
     - **n_H = 22**, so the energy required to break the bonds in hydrogen gas is \( \frac{22}{2} \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total bond energy for reactants: \( 9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ} \).

2. **Product Bond Energies**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - **9 C-C bonds**: Each C-C bond energy is \( 200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ} \).
     - **2 C=C bonds**: Each C=C bond energy is \( 300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ} \).
     - **21 C-H bonds**: Each C-H bond energy is \( 400 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 21 \times 400 = 8400 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total bond energy for the product: \( 1800 + 600 + 8400 = 10800 \, \text{kJ} \).

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:
   Using the formula:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = \text{(Sum of bond energies in reactants)} - \text{(Sum of bond energies in product)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 10100 - 10800 = -700 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:
   The calculated value of \( -700 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) does not match any of the provided options. The options are:
   - **A)** \( 11200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)
   - **B)** \( 67.4 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)
   - **C)** \( 11.44 \, \text{kJ/g} \)
   - **D)** \( 1900 \, \text{kJ/g} \)

   The discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be \( -700 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), but since this is not listed, the closest plausible answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning for this is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The enthalpy of formation calculated from the given bond energies and atomization energy is \( -700 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). However, since this value is not among the options, the most reasonable choice based on the given options is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds. So, there are two C=C bonds. Wait, maybe I should count all the bonds in the molecule because the question gives bond energies.

The problem provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make it into individual atoms. So for carbon, that's probably the energy to break all the bonds in its elemental form, which is graphite or diamond. But I'm not sure if that's needed here. Maybe I'll come back to that.

The bond energies given are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to calculate the total bond energies of the compound and relate it to the elements.

The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

But wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Or maybe I should think about the formation as building the molecule from its constituent atoms, so the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies required to break bonds in the reactants minus the energies released when forming bonds in the product.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies in the reactants) - (sum of bond energies in the product)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When a molecule is formed from its atoms, it's the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the energy released when the bonds form in the product.

Wait, for example, if the reaction is C (graphite) + H2 → CH4, the enthalpy change would be sum of bond energies of reactants (C-C and H-H) minus sum of bond energies in product (C-H bonds). But wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. The standard approach is: 

The standard enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. 

The formula is often written using the heats of atomization (which is the energy to break all bonds in the compound into individual atoms):

ΔHf° = (Σ Heats of atomization of products) - (Σ Heats of atomization of reactants)

But wait, or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Suppose the reaction is a + b → c. The enthalpy change is (sum of heats of atomization of c) - (sum of heats of atomization of a and b times their stoichiometric coefficients).

Wait, but in this problem, the molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So, for the formation reaction, we have:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → 1 mol of the compound.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf° = [n * (heat of atomization of C) + m * (heat of atomization of H2)] - [sum of bond energies in the compound]

Wait, no, because forming the molecule releases energy. So:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies in the molecule] - [sum of bond energies in the reactants]

Wait, maybe I should think about it as:

The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (reactants) to form the compound, minus the energy released when the compound's bonds form.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The standard approach is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies in the reactants) - (sum of bond energies in the product)

Wait, no. Let's think about it. If I have a reaction where elements combine to form a compound, the energy released is the sum of bond energies of the product minus the sum of bond energies of the reactants.

Wait, that would mean that enthalpy of formation would be negative if the reaction is exothermic, which is correct. So, the formula should be:

ΔHf° = sum (bond energies in reactants) - sum (bond energies in product)

Wait, wait. Let me think in terms of bond energies. Breaking bonds requires energy, and forming bonds releases energy. So, if the reaction is exothermic, the product has stronger bonds. So, the energy change is energy required to break reactant bonds minus energy released when forming product bonds.

So, for the formation reaction:

Reactants → Products

ΔH = sum (reactant bonds broken) - sum (product bonds formed)

But that's for the overall process. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for this reaction.

So, for the formation of the compound from its elements, the enthalpy of formation would be:

sum (bond energies of reactants) - sum (bond energies of product)

But wait, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. For carbon, that's graphite, which has a certain bond energy. For hydrogen, it's H2 gas.

So, for this problem:

The compound is made up of C and H. The reactants are C (graphite) and H2.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms) * (heat of atomization of C) ) + (number of H atoms / 2) * (heat of atomization of H2) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, no, because the heat of atomization is the energy needed to break all bonds in an element to make individual atoms. So, for the reaction, you have to break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) to get individual atoms, and then form the bonds in the product (the compound).

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

[Heat of atomization of C × moles of C] + [Heat of atomization of H2 × moles of H2] - [Sum of bond energies in the product]

Wait, but the bond energies in the product (the molecule) are the bonds that are formed. So, when the molecule forms, it releases energy equal to the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

So, the overall enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bonds formed in product]

In this case, the reactants are C (graphite) and H2. Each C in graphite has C-C bonds, so the heat of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol as given. Each H2 has H-H bonds.

Wait, but wait. The heat of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in the element to form individual atoms. So for C in graphite, the heat of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. For H2, the heat of atomization is 100 kJ/mol (because bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol given).

So, for each mole of C, you need 1000 kJ to break into atoms. For each mole of H2, you need 100 kJ to break into H atoms.

Then, when you form the molecule, you form all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule. Each bond contributes its bond energy as the energy released.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (moles of C × 1000) + (moles of H2 × 50 × 100) ] - [ (sum of bond energies in the molecule) ]

Wait, wait. Moles of H2 is equal to (number of H atoms) / 2, because each H2 has two H atoms. So, if the molecule has x H atoms, then moles of H2 is x/2.

Wait, but to get the atoms, you need to break the H2 into 2H per molecule, so each H2 contributes 100 kJ to break into two H atoms.

Wait, no. The bond energy is per mole. So, the bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. So, for each mole of H2, you need 100 kJ to break into two moles of H atoms.

So, if the molecule has, say, y H atoms, then the number of moles of H2 needed is y/2.

So, the heat of atomization for H2 would be (y/2) * 100 kJ.

Similarly, the number of moles of C is the number of C atoms in the molecule. Let's call that n_C.

So, heat of atomization for C is n_C * 1000 kJ.

Then, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is the sum of all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the compound.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C * 1000) + (n_H / 2 * 100) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, but wait. The bond energies in the molecule are the bonds that are formed. So, for each C-C bond, the bond energy is 200 kJ/mol. When the molecule forms, those bonds are formed, releasing energy. So, the sum of the bond energies is the total energy released.

So, the calculation is:

ΔHf° = (energy required to break reactants into atoms) - (energy released when forming product bonds)

Which is:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C * 1000) + (n_H / 2 * 100) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds * 200) + (number of C=C bonds * 300) + (number of C-H bonds * 400) ) ]

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. All bond energies are given per mole, so I need to calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

So, first, let's count the number of each type of bond in the given molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write it out step by step.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-

So, that's:

CH3-C(CH3)=CH-

So, that's a central C connected to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to a CH. So, in this part:

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see, each CH3 has a C-C bond with the central C. Wait, no. Each CH3 is a methyl group attached to the central C. So, each CH3 has one C-C bond (each CH3 is connected via a single bond to the central C). So, in (CH3)2C, there are two C-C bonds (each CH3 contributes one).

Then, the central C is double-bonded to a CH. So, that's one C=C bond.

Then, the next part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the structure continues as:

...CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, let's count all the bonds.

First, let's count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   - Each (CH3) has 3 C-H bonds. So, two CH3 groups have 2 * 3 = 6 C-H bonds.
   - The central C has two C-C bonds (each connected to CH3 groups) → 2 C-C bonds.
   - The central C is double-bonded to a CH → 1 C=C bond.
   - The CH has 3 C-H bonds? Wait, CH has one C-H bond, or more? Let me think. No, the group is CH, so it's CH2? Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-...

Wait, the structure might be better represented as:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let me break it down:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → This is a double bond between the central C (which is attached to two CH3 groups) and a CH group.

   - So, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups (each via single C-C bonds) → 2 C-C bonds.
   - The central C is double-bonded to the CH → 1 C=C bond.
   - The CH has one C-H bond, but wait, the CH is connected to the next part as CH-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps each CH group has one C-H bond. Let me think about each part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the bonds in the entire molecule.

Let me count each type:

C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

Looking at the structure:

1. (CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, let's list each C-C bond:

- The central C (let's say C1) in (CH3)2C is connected to two CH3 groups (C1-C2 and C1-C3, where C2 and C3 are each CH3 carbons).
- C1 is double-bonded to C4 (the CH group: C4 is connected to C1 via double bond, and to C5 via single bond (C4-C5: CH-CH2...).
- C5 is connected to C4 via single bond (CH2- group), so C4-C5 is a C-C bond.
- C5 is connected to C6 (CH(CH3)), so C5-C6 is another C-C bond.
- C6 is connected to C5, then to C7 (CH2), and C6 has a CH3 group attached (so C6-C7? No, C6 is CH(CH3), so connected to C5, C7, and CH3).
Wait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled. Let me approach this methodically.

Alternative approach: Each group contributes certain bonds.

1. The molecule is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C-C bonds:

Each single bond is a C-C.

- In (CH3)2C, each CH3 contributes one C-C bond with the central C. So, 2 C-C bonds.
- The central C is double-bonded to the next C (so no single bond there; it's a double bond, so not a C-C bond).
- The next C (let's say C4) is connected to C5 via single bond (CH2-CH...).
   So, C4-C5 is another C-C bond.
- C5 is connected to C6 (CH(CH3)) → another C-C bond (C5-C6).
- C6 is connected to C7 (CH2-) → another C-C bond (C6-C7).
- C7 is connected to C8 (CH=...).
   So, C7-C8 → another C-C bond.
- C8 is connected to C9 (the other C in the double bond). So, C8-C9 is a double bond (C=C), so no single bond there.
- Additionally, in the ends, perhaps there are more C-C bonds.

Wait, maybe I should count each single bond between two carbons.

Let me try:

Each single bond is a C-C.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, the chain is:

C1 (from (CH3)2C) = C2 (the CH group) – C3 (CH2) – C4 (CH(CH3)) – C5 (CH2) – C6 (CH=C(CH3)2)

Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons:

1. C1: attached to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to C2.

2. C2: double-bonded to C1 and single-bonded to C3.

3. C3: single-bonded to C2 and C4.

4. C4: single-bonded to C3 and C5, plus a CH3 attached.

5. C5: single-bonded to C4 and C6.

6. C6: single-bonded to C5 and C7, and has a double bond to C7.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is: C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

So, the connections are:

C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

Each '-' represents a single bond.

So, the C-C bonds are:

C1-C2: no, because it's a double bond. So no single C-C bond there.

C2-C3: single bond → 1 C-C.

C3-C4: single bond → 1 C-C.

C4-C5: single bond → 1 C-C.

C5-C6: single bond → 1 C-C.

C6-C7: no, it's a double bond → no single C-C bond.

So, in the main chain, there are 4 C-C bonds.

Wait, but each CH3 group is connected via single bonds. Let's see:

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

C2 is connected to one CH (from the CH group) → which is a C-H bond, but that's not a C-C bond.

C3 is connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, no. C3 is CH2, so it's connected to C2 and C4, and two H's.

So, already, I'm getting confused. Let's perhaps count all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: The central C (C1) is connected to two CH3 groups (C-C bonds) → 2.

2. The double bond C1=C2: not a C-C bond.

3. Then C2 is connected to C3 via single bond → another C-C bond.

4. C3 is connected to C4 → another → total 3.

5. C4 is connected to C5 → total 4.

6. C5 is connected to C6 → 5.

7. C6 is connected to C7 via double bond (C6=C7) → no C-C bond.

8. Additionally, C7 is connected to two CH3 groups → each is a C-C bond. So, 2 more → total 7.

So, total C-C bonds: 7.

Wait, let me recount:

- C1 has two C-C bonds (to two CH3 groups) → 2.

- C2 connected to C3 → 1 → total 3.

- C3 connected to C4 → 1 → 4.

- C4 connected to C5 → 1 →5.

- C5 connected to C6 →1 →6.

- C6 connected to two CH3 groups (so two more C-C bonds) → 8.

Wait, because C6 is double-bonded to C7. So, C6 is connected to C7 via double bond (no single C-C), but C6 has two CH3 groups attached → that's two C-C bonds.

So, yes, 8 C-C bonds in total.

Wait, but let me think again. Each CH3 group is a single C-C bond. So, for C1, two CH3 → 2 C-C bonds.

For C6, two CH3 → 2 more → 2+2=4.

Then, in the main chain, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 → that's four more → total 8.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the main chain had five C-C bonds (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7?), but wait, C6 is connected to C7 via double bond, so no C-C bond there.

So, main chain C-C bonds: 4.

So, 4 (main chain) + 4 (from CH3 groups) = 8 C-C bonds.

But wait, each CH3 is a separate C-C bond. So, for each CH3 attached to any C, it's one C-C bond. Let's count all CH3 groups.

Looking at the molecule:

- (CH3)2 → two CH3 groups → 2 C-C bonds.

- CH(CH3) → one CH3 → 1 C-C.

- CH=C(CH3)2 → two CH3 groups → 2 C-C bonds.

So, total CH3 groups: 2 (from first part) + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 (from last part) → 5 CH3 groups.

Each contributes one C-C bond → 5 C-C bonds.

In the main chain, how many C-C bonds?

Looking at the main chain:

C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

So, C2-C3 is a bond → 1.

C3-C4 → another → 2.

C4-C5 → 3.

C5-C6 →4.

Wait, that's four C-C bonds in the main chain.

So total C-C bonds: 5 (from CH3) +4 (main chain) =9? No, wait, perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, no. The CH3 groups are attached to certain Cs, each contributing one C-C bond. The main chain's C-C bonds are the ones between the Cs in the chain.

So, structure:

C1=C2–C3–C4–C5–C6=C7.

C1 has two CH3 → 2 C-C bonds.

C2 is connected to C3 →1→ total 3.

C3 connected to C4 →4.

C4 connected to C5 →5.

C5 connected to C6 →6.

C6 has two CH3 → 2 more → total 8.

So, 8 C-C bonds in total.

Now, what about C=C bonds?

The molecule has two double bonds: C1=C2 and C6=C7.

So, two C=C bonds.

Now, the C-H bonds.

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. Let's count all CH3 groups.

As before, there are 2 (from C1), 1 (from C4), and 2 (from C7) → total 5 CH3 groups. Each has 3 → 5 *3 =15 C-H bonds.

Then, other C-H groups:

Looking at the structure, there are some CH groups.

For example, the C2 is part of CH (from =CH-). So, that's one C-H bond.

Similarly, the C3 is part of CH2, which has two C-H bonds.

Wait, let's go step by step.

Each carbon in the molecule:

- C1: (CH3)2C= → So, C1 is connected to two CH3, and double-bonded to C2. So, no H attached to C1.

- C2: =CH- → So, C2 has one H attached (since it's CH), so one C-H bond.

- C3: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

- C4: CH(CH3) → that's one H attached (since it's CH, not CH2 or CH3), so one C-H bond.

- C5: CH2 → two C-H bonds.

- C6: double-bonded to C7, and connected to two CH3 groups. So, no H attached to C6.

- C7: =C(CH3)2 → no H attached.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount the C-H bonds:

1. C1: no H.

2. C2: CH → 1 H.

3. C3: CH2 → 2 H.

4. C4: CH → 1 H.

5. C5: CH2 → 2 H.

6. C6: no H.

7. C7: no H.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups:

- C1: 2 → 2 *3 =6.

- C4: 1 →3.

- C7: 2 →6.

Total H in CH3 groups:6 +3 +6 =15.

Other H groups:

C2:1, C3:2, C4:1, C5:2. So 1+2+1+2=6.

Total C-H bonds:15 (from CH3) +6 (from other CH groups) =21.

Wait, wait, each C-H is a single bond, so each contributes one bond. So, 21 C-H bonds.

So, now putting it all together:

C-C bonds: 8 → each is 200 kJ/mol → 8 *200 =1600 kJ.

C=C bonds:2 → each 300 → 2 *300 =600 kJ.

C-H bonds:21 → each 400 → 21 *400 =8400 kJ.

So, sum of bond energies in the molecule =1600 +600 +8400 =10600 kJ.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The bond energies are per mole. So, each bond contributes its energy. So, for 8 C-C bonds, it's 8 *200 kJ. But wait, that's 1600 kJ for all 8 bonds.

Wait no, no. Wait, the bond energies are given per mole. So, each mole of C-C bond has 200 kJ. If I have 8 C-C bonds in one mole of the molecule, then the total energy for C-C is 8 *200=1600 kJ.

Similarly for C=C: 2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

So, sum is 1600 +600 +8400 =10600 kJ.

Now, the reactants are C and H2.

The number of C atoms in the molecule:

Looking at the formula, it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 contributes 2 CH3 groups, each CH3 has 1 C. So, the molecule has:

- Each (CH3)2: 2 C.

- The central C in (CH3)2C: 1 C.

- Then, the next C in =CH-: 1.

- CH2-: another C → so far, 2+1+1+1=5?

Wait, perhaps better to count each carbon.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count all carbons:

- (CH3)2C : 3 C (two CH3 and one central C).

- =CH- : 1 C.

- CH2- :1 C.

- CH(CH3) :1 C.

- CH2- :1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the CH and the C connected to two CH3).

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try:

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C= → 3 C (two CH3 and one C).

2. =CH- → 1 C.

3. -CH2- → 1 C.

4. -CH(CH3)- →1 C.

5. -CH2- →1 C.

6. -CH=C(CH3)2 →2 C (the CH and the C with two CH3).

So, 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +2 =9 C atoms in total.

So, n_C =9.

n_H: Let's count the H atoms.

Each CH3 group has 3 H.

Earlier, we thought there are 5 CH3 groups: let me recount.

- (CH3)2C: 2 CH3 → 2 *3 =6 H.

- =CH-: 1 H.

- CH2-: 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 CH3 → 3 H, but the CH has 1 H → so CH(CH3) has 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4 H.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

=CH-: the CH has 1 H.

Each CH2 has 2 H.

Each C in CH(CH3) has 1 H (since it's CH) plus the 3 from CH3.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count every H in the molecule.

Let's go step by step.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C: two CH3 groups (each 3 H) → 2*3=6 H.

The C in (CH3)2C is connected to =CH-, which is CH.

So, CH has 1 H.

Then, -CH2-: 2 H.

Then, -CH(CH3): the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H → total 4 H.

Next, -CH2-: 2 H.

Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C=C has the other C connected to two CH3 (each 3 H) → 2*3=6 H.

Wait, no. The structure is CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C on the left (CH) has 1 H.

The C on the right (C(CH3)2) has no H attached (since it's connected to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to the other C).

So, the H count from CH=C(CH3)2 is 1 (from CH) + 0 (from C(CH3)2) → 1 H.

Wait, but the CH3 groups each have 3 H.

So, putting it all together:

H from (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Two CH3:6 H.

- CH:1 H.

So, 7 H.

Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH2:2 H.

- CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 → total 4 H.

- CH2:2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and two CH3 groups: 2*3=6 H.

So, adding up:

6 (from first CH3) +1 (CH) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH) +6 (CH3 from C=C) → 6+1=7; 7+2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22.

Wait, that makes 22 H atoms.

Wait, but let's recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   - 2 CH3: 6 H.

   - CH:1 H.

   → 6+1=7.

2. -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:

   a. CH2:2 H → total 9.

   b. CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 →4 → total 13.

   c. CH2:2 →15.

   d. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H; the C=C has two CH3 groups → 3*2=6 H → total 1+6=7 H.

   So, adding d → 15 +7 =22.

So, total H atoms:22.

But wait, each CH3 in the C=C part: there are two CH3 groups attached to the C on the right of the double bond. Each contributes 3 H → 2*3=6 H. Plus the CH on the left contributes 1 H → total 7 H from the last part.

So, overall, 22 H atoms.

Wait, but in the earlier count, I thought each CH3 contributes 3 H, and other groups contribute based on their structure.

So, with 22 H atoms, the number of moles of H2 needed is 22 / 2 =11 moles.

So, n_H =22 → n_H/2 =11.

Now, putting it all into the formula.

ΔHf° = [ (n_C * 1000) + (n_H/2 * 100) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

n_C is 9 → 9 *1000 =9000 kJ.

n_H is 22 →22/2=11 →11 *100=1100 kJ.

So, sum of reactant bond energies:9000 +1100=10100 kJ.

Sum of product bond energies:10600 kJ.

So, ΔHf°=10100 -10600 =-500 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that gives a negative value, which would imply the reaction is exothermic.

But looking at the options, I don’t see any negative options. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me recheck the numbers.

n_C: earlier thought 9? Let me recount the carbons in the molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C= → 3 C (two CH3 and one central C).

- =CH- → 1 C.

- CH2- →1 C.

- CH(CH3)- →1 C.

- CH2- →1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2 → 2 C (CH and the C with two CH3).

So, 3+1+1+1+1+2=9 C → correct.

n_C=9 → 9 *1000=9000 kJ.

n_H=22 →11 moles of H2 →11 *100=1100 kJ.

So, reactant bond energies:9000 +1100=10100.

Product bond energies:8 C-C (each 200), 2 C=C (each 300), 21 C-H (each 400).

So,

C-C:8 *200=1600.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

Sum:1600+600=2200; 2200+8400=10600.

So, 10600.

ΔHf°=10100 -10600 =-500 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have negative numbers. So, perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility is that the formula is reversed. Maybe the product bond energies are subtracted from the reactant bond energies.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies in product - sum of bond energies in reactants.

Which would give 10600 -10100=500 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, 500 isn't present. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the given bond energies are bond energies for breaking. So, when you form bonds, you release energy. So, the total bond energy in the product is the energy released, which is subtracted from the energy used to break the reactant bonds.

So, the correct formula is ΔHf° = (reactant bond energies) - (product bond energies).

Which would be 10100 -10600= -500.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of bonds.

Let me check the counts again.

C-C bonds: did I count 8 correctly?

Each CH3 contributes one C-C bond.

In the molecule, the CH3 groups are:

- Two from (CH3)2C → 2.

- One from CH(CH3) →1.

- Two from C=C(CH3)2 →2.

So, that's 5 CH3 groups →5 C-C bonds.

In the main chain:

C2-C3 is single →1.

C3-C4 →1.

C4-C5 →1.

C5-C6 →1.

That's four.

So, 5+4=9. Oh wait, earlier I thought 8, but perhaps it's 9.

Wait, so C-C bonds:9.

If that's the case, 9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

So, sum product bonds:1800 +600 +8400=10800.

Then, ΔHf° =10100 -10800= -700.

But again, not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me count again:

Each CH3 group contributes one C-C bond.

Number of CH3 groups:

Looking at the molecule:

- Two from (CH3)2C →2.

- One from CH(CH3) →1.

- Two from C(CH3)2 →2.

Total 5 CH3 →5 C-C.

In the main chain:

C2 connected to C3 →1.

C3 connected to C4 →2.

C4 connected to C5 →3.

C5 connected to C6 →4.

C6 connected to C7 →5, but it's a double bond, so no single C-C.

So, four C-C in the main chain.

Total C-C:5 (from CH3) +4 (main) =9.

So, product bond energies:9*200=1800, 2*300=600, 21*400=8400 → sum 1800+600=2400 +8400=10800.

So, ΔHf°=10100 -10800= -700 kJ/mol.

Still no matching option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the sum of bond energies in the reactants minus sum in the product, but the product is the molecule, which is 1 mole, while the reactants may be in different amounts.

Wait, let me think of the reaction.

The reaction is:

n C (graphite) + m H2 → 1 mol of the compound.

So, the bond energies are on a per mole basis.

So, the moles of C is 9 (as per the molecule), and moles of H2 is 22/2=11.

So, the bond energies for reactants are:

9 * (heat of atomization of C) =9 *1000=9000.

11 * (heat of atomization of H2)=11 *100=1100.

Total reactant bond energies:10100.

Product bond energies: sum of all bond energies in the molecule →10800 (assuming 9 C-C bonds).

So, ΔHf°=10100 -10800= -700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, could the problem be asking for enthalpy of formation per mole, but I'm using per molecule?

No, the problem states 'given' bond energies are per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the formation from elements, but from another source. Or perhaps I need to use a different approach.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the formula:

ΔHf° = (Σ [number of bonds × bond energy]) for reactants - (Σ [number of bonds × bond energy]) for products.

Wait, no, that would be for a reaction where the reactants and products are broken down into elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants)] - [Σ (bonds formed in products)].

Wait, but if the reaction is making a molecule from elements, then the bonds broken in reactants are the bonds in the elements (C and H2), and bonds formed are the bonds in the product (the molecule).

So, the correct formula would be:

ΔHf° = (bond energies of C and H2) - (bond energies of the molecule).

Wait, but earlier calculation gives that as 10100 -10800= -700.

But the options given don't include -700.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds and C-H bonds.

Let me recount the number of C-C bonds again.

Each CH3 contributes a C-C bond.

Total CH3 groups:5 →5 C-C.

Main chain:

C2-C3 →1.

C3-C4 →2.

C4-C5 →3.

C5-C6 →4.

C6-C7 → no, double bond.

So, 4 C-C in the main chain.

Total C-C bonds:5+4=9.

So, 9 ×200=1800.

C=C bonds:2 ×300=600.

C-H bonds:21 ×400=8400.

Sum:1800+600=2400 +8400=10800.

So, product bond energy:10800.

Reactant bond energy:9000+1100=10100.

ΔHf°=10100-10800= -700.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bond energies given are in kJ per bond, not per mole. But no, the question says "Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol".

So, the given bond energies are per mole, not per bond.

So, each mole of C-C bonds contributes 200 kJ.

Thus, for 9 moles of C-C bonds, it's 9×200=1800.

Same for other bonds.

Wait, but the molecule is one mole. So, each bond in the molecule is present in one mole of the compound.

So, the sum is per mole.

So, the calculation seems correct.

But the options don't have -700, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement.

Oh, wait! The question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation" but perhaps it's considering only the bonds broken and formed in the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy of formation being the sum of the bond energies of the elements minus the sum of the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, but that would be the same as what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of formation as the energy released when the molecule is formed, which would be the negative of what I calculated.

So, if the molecule releases energy when formed, the enthalpy of formation is negative. But the options don't have negative values.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe it's using the formula:

ΔHf° = sum (elements' bond energies) - sum (molecule's bond energies).

Which would be 10100 -10800= -700.

But, perhaps the question is asking for the absolute value? Or perhaps it's a positive value because the question is about the energy required.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds.

Let me recount the C-H bonds.

Earlier, I thought there were 21 C-H bonds.

But perhaps the structure has more or fewer.

Let me think again.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds.

Number of CH3 groups:5 →5 ×3=15.

Other C-H bonds:

C2: CH →1.

C3: CH2 →2.

C4: CH →1.

C5: CH2 →2.

C6: no.

C7: no.

So, 1+2+1+2=6.

Total C-H:15+6=21.

Yes, that's correct.

So, that's 21 C-H bonds.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated using only the single bonds, not the double bonds. But no, double bonds are included.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of atomization of C as the energy per atom, not per mole. Wait, the given enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So, per mole of C atoms.

But in the calculation, I used 9 moles of C atoms (since the molecule has 9 C atoms) → 9 *1000=9000 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C atoms. So, if the molecule has 9 C atoms, then it's 9 moles of C atoms → 9 *1000=9000.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. The calculation leads to -700 kJ/mol, but that's not an option. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation [...] Given, enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So, units are per mole, but the options include per gram.

So, perhaps the answer is in per gram, which would require knowing the molar mass.

Wait, let's calculate the molar mass of the molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 is 15 g/mol (12 +3*1).

Now, let's count the number of each atom.

Carbon:

Earlier we have 9 C atoms.

Hydrogen:

Earlier count was 22 H atoms.

So, molar mass =9*12 +22*1 →108 +22=130 g/mol.

So, 130 g/mol.

So, if the enthalpy of formation is -700 kJ/mol, then per gram it would be -700 /130 ≈ -5.38 kJ/g.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, but the options C and D are in kJ/g. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, D is 1900 kJ/g, which seems too high.

But I don't see any of these matching -5.38.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the actual ΔHf is positive 700, which would mean the question is looking for the magnitude.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of combustion or something else. But no, the question is about formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go step by step again.

Total C-C bonds:9 →9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 →2*300=600.

C-H:21 →21*400=8400.

Sum:1800+600=2400 +8400=10800.

Reactant bond energies:9000 (C) +1100 (H2) =10100.

ΔHf°=10100 -10800= -700.

So, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options don't include this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has fewer bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each C=C bond is only counted once, but I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies in the product] - [sum of bond energies in the reactants].

Which would be 10800 -10100=700.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is different. Let me re-examine the structure.

The given structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is symmetric. So, perhaps the molecule is 1,7-dimethyl-1,6-diphenylheptene or something, but I don't think that affects the bond count.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the molecule has more C-H bonds than I thought.

Wait, if I recount C-H bonds, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me recount:

In (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H.

Number of CH3 groups:

- (CH3)2C:2.

- CH(CH3):1.

- CH=C(CH3)2:2.

Total 5 CH3 → 5×3=15.

Other C-H:

C2: CH →1.

C3: CH2 →2.

C4: CH →1.

C5: CH2 →2.

C6: no.

C7: no.

So, 1+2+1+2=6.

Total C-H:15+6=21.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 21 ×400=8400.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of atomization as per atom, not per mole.

Wait, the given is "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So, per mole of C atoms.

So, 9 C atoms →9 moles →9 ×1000=9000 kJ.

But perhaps I should have used kJ per atom.

Wait, 1000 kJ per mole → per atom is 1000 / (6.022e23) ≈ 1.66e-22 kJ/atom.

Which is negligible and wouldn't change the calculation.

So, no. So, I'm not seeing the mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the enthalpy of formation to be positive, so the correct answer isn't present, but the closest option is B) 67.4.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I have a wrong number of H atoms.

Wait, let me recount the H.

Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups:5 →15 H.

Other H:

C2: CH →1.

C3: CH2 →2.

C4: CH →1.

C5: CH2 →2.

C6: no.

C7: no.

So, 1+2+1+2=6.

Total H:15 +6=21.

Wait, 21 H. So, H2 needed is 21/2=10.5 moles. But I used 11 earlier.

Wait, 10.5 ×100=1050.

Ah! I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I used 11 moles of H2, but 21 H atoms mean 10.5 moles of H2.

So, the correct calculation is:

n_C=9 →9×1000=9000.

n_H=21 →21/2=10.5 →10.5 ×100=1050.

So, reactant bond energies:9000 +1050=10050.

Product bond energies:10800.

ΔHf°=10050 -10800= -750.

Still doesn't match any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the H-H bond energy as 432 kJ/mol? But the given is 100 kJ/mol. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered each C=C bond as 615 kJ/mol, but the given is 300.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of enthalpy of formation as the energy released when the molecule is formed, so the absolute value. So, 700 or 750.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 8 C-C bonds, not 9.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

CH3 groups contribute 5 C-C bonds.

Main chain:

C2-C3 →1.

C3-C4 →2.

C4-C5 →3.

C5-C6 →4.

Total:4.

So, 5+4=9.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should only count the single bonds in the molecule.

Wait, the molecule has two double bonds, so each double bond has one less single bond.

So, in the main chain, between C1 and C2, it's a double bond → no single C-C.

Similarly, between C6 and C7, no single C-C.

So, the main chain's C-C bonds are:

C2-C3 →1.

C3-C4 →2.

C4-C5 →3.

C5-C6 →4.

So, 4.

Plus the 5 from CH3 groups →9.

So, 9 C-C bonds.

I think I'm correct.

Perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using the formula for enthalpy of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the atoms minus the bond energies of the molecule.

But that's what I did.

Wait, let me think. Maybe the question is using the enthalpy of formation as the sum of all bond energies in the molecule minus the sum of bond energies in the elements.

So, ΔHf°= sum (product bonds) - sum (reactant bonds).

Which would be 10800 -10050=750.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the energy in kJ/g, not kJ/mol.

If the molar mass is 130 g/mol, then 700 kJ/mol →700/130≈5.38 kJ/g.

But the options have C)11.44 kJ/g and D)1900 kJ/g.

Maybe I made a mistake in molar mass.

Wait, what's the molecular formula of the compound?

The given structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's write the formula.

Each (CH3)2 contributes 2 C and 6 H.

The central C is connected to =CH-: so adds one C and one H.

Then, CH2- adds one C and 2 H.

CH(CH3): adds one C and (1 +3)=4 H.

CH2-: adds one C and 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: adds one C (from CH) and (6 H from two CH3) and one C from the double bond (so two CH3, 6 H).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count C and H.

Total C:

As before, 9.

Total H:

Let me recount.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (from two CH3) +1 (CH)=7 H.

CH2-:2 →9.

CH(CH3):1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =4 →13.

CH2-:2 →15.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 (CH) +6 (from two CH3) →7 →22.

So, 22 H.

So, molecular formula is C9H22.

Molar mass:9×12 +22×1=108+22=130 g/mol.

So, if the ΔHf is -700 kJ/mol, then per gram it's -700 /130 ≈ -5.38 kJ/g.

But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but option B is 67.4 kJ/mol. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the H atoms, leading to a different n_H.

Wait, if the molecule has 20 H atoms, then n_H/2=10 →10 ×100=1000.

So, reactant bond energies:9000+1000=10000.

Product bond energies:10800.

ΔHf=10000 -10800=-800.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 24 H atoms →12 H2 →12 ×100=1200.

So, reactant bond energies:9000+1200=10200.

Product:10800.

ΔHf=10200-10800= -600.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternative approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (number of C atoms × heat of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × ½ × heat of atomization of H2) ) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule).

Which is what I did.

So, perhaps I'm correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Or perhaps there's a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energies in kJ, not per mole.

Wait, the given bond energies are per mole. So, for one mole, it's per mole.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of all bond energies of the elements minus the sum of bond energies of the molecule.

So, that's what I did.

But I'm not seeing any error in that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the bond energies in the molecule as the bonds that are broken, not formed.

Wait, no, because when the molecule is formed, the bonds are formed, releasing energy.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Since none of the calculations match the options, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has only 8 C-C bonds.

If that's the case:

8 ×200=1600.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:21 ×400=8400.

Sum:1600+600=2200 +8400=10600.

Reactant bond energies:9000 +1050=10050.

ΔHf=10050 -10600= -550.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the single bonds and not the double bonds.

Wait, but the double bonds contribute to bond energies as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the bond energies in the molecule, not the formation.

But the question is about enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total bond energy and compare to the options.

Sum of bond energies in molecule:10600 or 10800.

But the options have 11200 as option A.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

If the molecule has 10 C-C bonds:

10 ×200=2000.

C=C:600.

C-H:8400.

Sum:2000+600=2600 +8400=11000.

Then, reactant bond energies:9000 +1050=10050.

ΔHf=10050 -11000= -950.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the product bonds is 11200.

If so, then 11200 -10050=1150. But that's not an option.

Option A is 11200.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of bond energies in the molecule, which is option A.

But that seems unlikely. The question asks for enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is written as ΔHf° = sum (reactant bonds) - sum (product bonds).

Which would be 10050 -10800= -750.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is positive 750, but that's not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use only the single bond energies.

Wait, maybe the double bonds are not counted. But that can't be right, as the problem includes their bond energies.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be -700 kJ/mol, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to provide different bond energies or a different structure.

Given the options, the closest match to a positive value is option B)67.4, but I don't see how that arises from my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H atoms. Let me recount.

Let me write down each H:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

Groups:

1. (CH3)2C: 2 CH3 →6 H.

2. =CH-: 1 H.

3. CH2-:2 H.

4. CH(CH3):1 (CH) +3 (CH3) →4 H.

5. CH2-:2 H.

6. CH=C(CH3)2:1 (CH) +6 (two CH3) →7 H.

Total H:6 +1 +2 +4 +2 +7=22.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I might have to go with the calculation I have, but it's not matching any option. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the product bonds minus the sum of the reactant bonds, leading to 10800 -10050=750.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in grams, but that brings in the molar mass.

If the ΔHf is -700 kJ/mol, and molar mass is 130 g/mol, then per gram it's -700 /130 ≈ -5.38 kJ/g.

But the options have C)11.44 kJ/g and D)1900 kJ/g.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula where each bond contributes its energy to the formation, but only for the new bonds formed.

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies as per bond, not per mole.

Wait, the given bond energies are per mole, so that can't be.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the correct answer isn't among the options. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't figure out how to reach that.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be:

ΔHf°= (sum of bonds in product) - (sum of bonds in reactants) → 10800 -10050=750 →750 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

In conclusion, based on my calculations, the correct answer should be -700 kJ/mol, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake. But I can't find where. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I don't know why.


The problem involves calculating the enthalpy of formation of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` using the provided bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{(Sum of bond energies in reactants)} - \text{(Sum of bond energies in product)}
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Reactants and Bond Energies**:
   - The reactants are carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).
   - The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as **1000 kJ/mol**, and the bond energy of H-H is **100 kJ/mol**.
   - The molecule contains **9 carbon atoms** and **22 hydrogen atoms**:
     - **n_C = 9**, so the energy required to break the bonds in carbon is \( 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ} \).
     - **n_H = 22**, so the energy required to break the bonds in hydrogen gas is \( \frac{22}{2} \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total bond energy for reactants: \( 9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ} \).

2. **Product Bond Energies**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - **9 C-C bonds**: Each C-C bond energy is \( 200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ} \).
     - **2 C=C bonds**: Each C=C bond energy is \( 300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ} \).
     - **21 C-H bonds**: Each C-H bond energy is \( 400 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), so \( 21 \times 400 = 8400 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total bond energy for the product: \( 1800 + 600 + 8400 = 10800 \, \text{kJ} \).

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:
   Using the formula:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = \text{(Sum of bond energies in reactants)} - \text{(Sum of bond energies in product)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 10100 - 10800 = -700 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:
   The calculated value of \( -700 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) does not match any of the provided options. The options are:
   - **A)** \( 11200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)
   - **B)** \( 67.4 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)
   - **C)** \( 11.44 \, \text{kJ/g} \)
   - **D)** \( 1900 \, \text{kJ/g} \)

   The discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be \( -700 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), but since this is not listed, the closest plausible answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning for this is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The enthalpy of formation calculated from the given bond energies and atomization energy is \( -700 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). However, since this value is not among the options, the most reasonable choice based on the given options is:

**Answer: B**
