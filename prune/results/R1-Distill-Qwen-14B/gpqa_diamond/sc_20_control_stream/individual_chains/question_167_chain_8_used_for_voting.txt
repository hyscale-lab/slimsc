Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh right, because when you have a superposition of coherent states, the normalization comes out of the inner product. So N squared is the inner product of the state with itself, which is 1 + [sin(phi)]² <alpha| -alpha> + [cos(phi)]² <alpha| alpha> + cross terms. Wait, since |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Their inner product is exp(-2|alpha|² + alpha*(-alpha)* + ... Wait, wait, actually the inner product <alpha| beta> is exp(-|alpha|² - |beta|² + alpha* beta + beta* alpha)/something... Oh wait, no, more accurately, <alpha|beta> = exp(-|alpha|²/2 - |beta|²/2 + alpha* beta). So for <alpha| -alpha>, that would be exp(-|alpha|² - |alpha|² + alpha*(-alpha))? Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, let me think: <alpha| -alpha> = exp( -|alpha|²/2 - | -alpha |²/2 + alpha* (-alpha) ). Since |-alpha|² is same as |alpha|². So it becomes exp( -|alpha|² - |alpha|² + (- |alpha|²) )? Wait, wait, no: the exponent is (-|alpha|^2/2 - |-alpha|^2/2 + alpha* (-alpha)). Since |-alpha|^2 is |alpha|^2, so this becomes (-|alpha|^2 -|alpha|^2 + alpha*(-alpha)) / 2? Wait, no, let me correct: the exponent is [ -|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta ] when beta is -alpha.

So substituting beta as -alpha: the exponent becomes (-|alpha|^2/2 - |alpha|^2/2) + alpha* (-alpha) ).

Which simplifies to (-|alpha|^2) + (- |alpha|^2) )? Because alpha* times (-alpha) is - |alpha|^2. So the exponent is -|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 = -2 |alpha|^2. Wait, no: the first part is (-|a|²/2 - |a|²/2 ) = -|a|². Then alpha* (-a) = - |a|². So total exponent is -|a|² - |a|² = -2 |a|². So <alpha| -alpha> = exp( -2 |alpha|^2 ). Hmm, right.

So for the normalization N, when I compute the inner product <psi|psi>, it's [cos^2(phi) <alpha|alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha| alpha> ].

But wait, since <alpha|alpha> is 1, and similarly for |-alpha|. The cross terms are cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha| -alpha> + < -alpha | alpha> ]. But < -alpha | alpha> is the conjugate of <alpha| -alpha>, which is exp(-2 |alpha|^2 ) as well, since < -alpha | alpha> = exp( -2 |alpha|^2 ) as well because it's the conjugate of <alpha| -alpha> which is real and positive? Wait, no, actually <alpha| -alpha> is real? Because it's exp(-something real). Since |alpha|² is real, so 2|alpha|² is real, so exponent is real and negative. So <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-2 |alpha|² ), a real positive number. So the cross terms are cos(phi) sin(phi) [ exp(-2 alpha² ) + exp(-2 alpha^2 ) ] = 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha²). 

So the normalization squared is 1 + [ 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] + sin^2(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) + cos^2(phi) exp(0) [wait no, wait, when I compute <psi | psi>, the terms are cos^2(phi) * 1, sin^2(phi) * 1, and the cross terms as 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 ). Wait, no, because the cross terms are [ cos(phi) sin(phi) ] [ <alpha| -alpha> + < -alpha | alpha> ].

But since <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-2 alpha^2 ), and < -alpha | alpha> is the same, because it's the same as <alpha | -alpha>*, which is the same as the original because it's real. So the cross terms are 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2). So the normalization squared is cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 ). But wait, that's (cos(phi) + sin(phi) exp(-alpha^2 ))^2? Because [a + b]^2 is a² + 2ab + b². Wait, wait, no: let me factor. Let me see: cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi =1, plus 2 cos phi sin phi exp(-2 alpha^2 ). So total is 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 ), because 2 cos phi sin phi is sin(2 phi). So N^2 is [1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 ) ], so N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )). Which matches the given expression for N. Okay, that all checks out.

Now the problem is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is the reference Gaussian state. So del_b is the relative entropy between rho and tau. Wait, but wait—wait, relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But here, it's written as tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So the formula given is the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau. So the nG is [S(rho) - S(tau)].

Wait, but wait, the relative entropy of rho with respect to tau is usually S(rho || tau) = S(tau) + tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). But no, perhaps I'm mixing. Wait, no, the formula is S(rho || tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). And in this case, del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], which is [S(rho) - S(tau)]. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference in entropy between rho and tau.

Wait, but non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. So if the state is Gaussian, the relative entropy would be zero, because you could choose tau as rho. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero for Gaussian states.

But what is the reference Gaussian state here? Because in the problem statement, it's specified that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So for the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, it's a non-Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity would be positive.

Hmm, but to compute del_b, I need to find the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau. But wait, what's tau? Is it the state that rho would reduce to if it were Gaussian? Or is there a specific reference Gaussian state here? The problem doesn't specify, which is a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that maximizes the entropy, or perhaps it's the Gaussian state closest to rho in some sense. Alternatively, maybe it's the state obtained from rho by making it Gaussian, perhaps by Gaussianizing the Wigner function or something else. Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the reference Gaussian state is the state with the same first and second moments as rho, but that's only possible for Gaussian states. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the structure of the state. The state given is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. The density matrix for a superposition state is non-Gaussian, and the relative entropy between it and a Gaussian reference state would give the non-Gaussianity.

But perhaps an easier approach is to note that when a state is Gaussian, its density matrix can be written in terms of first and second moments, but for a non-Gaussian state, you can't do that. So maybe another approach is to compute the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state here is the state obtained by taking the same state but making it Gaussian, perhaps by some method. Alternatively, perhaps it's the state with the same first moments as rho, but that might not make much sense for a superposition state. Wait, but in a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, perhaps the expectation values are zero? Let me think.

Wait, the state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Let's compute the expectation value of the position operator x. Well, coherent states have expectation values in x and p. The expectation value of x in |alpha> is proportional to Re(alpha), and similarly for p. But when you take a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, with alpha real, perhaps? Wait, the question says alpha is the amplitude. Hmm, but in any case, let me think, for a real alpha, |alpha> is a coherent state centered at (x, p) proportional to alpha, and |-alpha> is centered at (-x, -p). So the superposition would have a certain expectation value.

Wait, but wait, the state is normalized. Let me compute the expectation value of the annihilation operator a for the state |psi>.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

So <a> = Tr(rho a) = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a |alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a | -alpha> ].

But <alpha| a |alpha> = alpha, because a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>. Similarly, < -alpha | a | -alpha> = (-alpha), because a |-alpha> = (-alpha) |-alpha>.

So <a> = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) * alpha + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a |alpha> + sin^2(phi) * (-alpha) ].

Hmm, let's compute the cross terms. Let's compute <alpha|a |-alpha> = <alpha| a | -alpha> = <alpha| (-alpha) | -alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha| -alpha> = (-alpha) exp(-2 alpha^2 ), because <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-2 alpha^2 ) as we found earlier.

Similarly, < -alpha | a |alpha> is < -alpha | a |alpha> = < -alpha | alpha > * a |alpha> evaluated at |alpha>? Wait, let me think. a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, so < -alpha | a |alpha> = < -alpha | alpha> * alpha = exp(-2 alpha^2 ) * alpha.

So putting it all together:

< a > = (1/N²) [ cos²(phi) alpha + cos(phi) sin(phi) (-alpha exp(-2 alpha^2 )) + sin(phi) cos(phi) (alpha exp(-2 alpha^2 )) ) + sin^2(phi) (-alpha) ]

Hmm, the cross terms are cos(phi) sin(phi) [ (-alpha exp(-2 alpha^2 )) + alpha exp(-2 alpha^2 ) ].

Wait, because the terms are:

cos(phi) sin(phi) * (-alpha exp(-2 alpha^2 )) from the first cross term, and sin(phi) cos(phi) * (alpha exp(-2 alpha^2 )) from the second cross term.

Adding these together: cos(phi) sin(phi) [ (-alpha exp(-2 a² )) + alpha exp(-2 a² ) ] = 0.

So the cross terms cancel out because they are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

So <a> = (1/N²) [ cos²(phi) alpha - sin^2(phi) alpha ] = (alpha / N²) [ cos²(phi) - sin^2(phi) ].

Hmm, cos²(phi) - sin²(phi) is cos(2 phi). So <a> = (alpha cos(2 phi) ) / N².

Similarly, the expectation value of a^† would be the conjugate, which for real alpha would be the same as <a> if phi is such that it's symmetric. But perhaps for our purposes, the key point is that the state has some non-zero <a>, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state has the same <a> as rho? Wait, but in that case, the reference Gaussian state would have the same first and second moments as rho, but for a non-Gaussian state, the second moments don't determine the state uniquely. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but given that the state is a superposition of two coherent states, perhaps the reference Gaussian state would be the maximally mixed Gaussian state with the same first moments as rho. Or perhaps the reference is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho. But without more information, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the state obtained by taking the same |psi> but making it Gaussian, which for a superposition state isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that is the "closest" Gaussian approximation to rho, perhaps in terms of minimizing the relative entropy.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach. Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is such that when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is a specific case, and perhaps the non-Gaussianity can be calculated more directly.

Wait, let me plug in the given values: phi is -pi/4, alpha is 0.5.

So let's compute N first.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 )).

Compute 2 phi: 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) exp( -2*(0.5)^2 )) = sqrt( 1 - exp( -0.5 ) ).

Compute exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is ( cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> ≈ (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Hmm, but perhaps more importantly, the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state tau. But perhaps for this specific state, the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually a Gaussian state.

Wait, is a superposition of coherent states a Gaussian state? Wait, no, because Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, which includes coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. But a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian because its Wigner function is not Gaussian—it has interference terms.

Wait, but wait, perhaps when phi is such that the state reduces to a Gaussian state. For example, when phi is 0 or pi/2, the state is a single coherent state, which is Gaussian. But with phi = -pi/4, the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian.

Wait, but the given options include D) 0, which would imply that the non-Gaussianity is zero. So perhaps in this case, the state is actually Gaussian, which would make the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, but how can a superposition of coherent states be Gaussian? That seems unlikely. Oh wait, unless the state is a specific kind of superposition. For example, for certain choices of alpha and phi, maybe the state becomes a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps let me think about the case when alpha is 0.5 and phi is -pi/4.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is 0, the state is just |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, when phi is pi/2, the state is | - alpha >, which is also Gaussian. But when phi is something else, like -pi/4, the state is a superposition, which is non-Gaussian. So in that case, the non-Gaussianity would be non-zero, so option D would not be correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0. So perhaps the state becomes Gaussian under these parameters. How?

Wait, perhaps when sin(2 phi) is negative, but in a way that makes the state Gaussian. Let me think. The state is (|alpha> cos(phi) + |-alpha> sin(phi) ) / N. So when phi is -pi/4, 2 phi is -pi/2, so sin(2 phi) is -1. So N is sqrt(1 - exp( - 2 alpha^2 )). Hmm, which in our case, with alpha=0.5, N is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Hmm, but perhaps when the state is expressed as a superposition, it's actually a different kind of Gaussian state. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state, which is Gaussian, but that only happens when phi is 0 or pi/2, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a cat state, which is highly non-Gaussian, but the relative entropy measure might be zero. No, that can't be right because the relative entropy between a non-Gaussian state and a Gaussian state would not be zero.

Wait, but perhaps the relative entropy is zero when the state is Gaussian. Because if tau is rho, then S(rho) - S(tau) is zero. So for a Gaussian state, nG would be zero, but for a non-Gaussian state, it's positive.

But wait, the question is to calculate the non-Gaussianity for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. So if the state is non-Gaussian, nG should be positive. So the options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let's think about the density matrix rho of the state. The state is a pure state, so rho = |psi><psi|.

The entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). Since rho is pure, S(rho) is zero. So del_b would be [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau).

But wait, the formula is given as del_b = [ trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) ].

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so trace(rho ln rho) is -S(rho) = 0. So del_b is [0 - trace(tau ln tau)] = - trace(tau ln tau).

Hmm, but trace(tau ln tau) is the entropy of tau, S(tau). So del_b is - S(tau). But non-Gaussianity is supposed to be a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is. So if the state is Gaussian, then tau could be rho itself, so S(tau) is zero, and del_b is -0 = 0. So nG would be zero for Gaussian states.

But if the state is non-Gaussian, then tau is a different Gaussian state, and del_b would be positive or negative? Since S(tau) is positive, del_b would be negative. But non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is, so perhaps the correct measure is S(rho) - S(tau). Wait, but S(rho) is zero, so del_b would be - S(tau). But that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity nG is defined as S(rho || tau), which is the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But in our case, rho is pure, so tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So nG would be - tr(rho ln tau). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative entropy between the Gaussian state and the non-Gaussian state, which would be tr(tau ln tau) - tr(rho ln rho), but that's opposite of what's given.

Wait, the problem statement says the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy measure as del_b = [ trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) ].

Hmm, but for a pure state rho, S(rho) is zero. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). So if the state is non-Gaussian, del_b would be negative, which can't be the case since non-Gaussianity should be a positive quantity.

Ah, perhaps the definition is actually the other way around, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is taken as the absolute value, but the problem statement isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula, and the non-Gaussianity should be defined as trace(tau ln tau) - trace(rho ln rho). But then, for a pure rho, which is non-Gaussian, rho ln rho is zero, so the nG would be S(tau) - 0 = S(tau), which is positive.

But in any case, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the formula and should think about the problem differently. Let's consider whether the state is Gaussian or not. Wait, a superposition of two coherent states is a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive, meaning the correct options are A, B, or C.

But wait, when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, perhaps the state is a thermal state or something else Gaussian. Wait, no, because a thermal state is a statistical mixture, not a pure state. So the state given is a pure state, so it can't be a thermal state, which would be mixed.

So perhaps the state is non-Gaussian, and the non-Gaussianity is positive.

But without knowing the exact reference Gaussian state, it's hard to compute the entropy. Alternatively, perhaps in the case where phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state becomes a coherent state, thus making the non-Gaussianity zero. But earlier calculations suggest that's not the case.

Wait, let's think again: when phi is zero, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. When phi is pi/2, it's |-alpha>, which is Gaussian. But when phi is -pi/4, it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But perhaps for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is a Gaussian state. Hmm, how? Let me think: for a superposition to be Gaussian, perhaps the state must reduce to a coherent state or another Gaussian state, but that's only possible if the coefficients make it so. Alternatively, perhaps when the cross terms in the density matrix cause the state to have Gaussian properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. Let me compute |psi> under these conditions.

|psi> = [ cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ] / N.

cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So |psi> = [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ] / N.

N is sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2) exp(-2*(0.5)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> ≈ [ 0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but is this a coherent state? No, because a coherent state is just a single |alpha>, not a superposition. So the state is a cat state, which is definitely non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so options A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact reference state, it's hard to compute the value. Maybe the question is implying that the relative entropy is zero because the state is Gaussian, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to note that the state is a superposition of two coherent states with equal amplitudes, and perhaps this makes it a Gaussian state. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the relative entropy is zero, implying that rho and tau are the same. But that would only happen if rho is Gaussian, which it isn't in this case.

Hmm... I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

Well, without knowing the exact reference Gaussian state, perhaps the answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the state is Gaussian under these parameters, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait! Wait a minute. Let me think about the state's structure again. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

If phi is such that the coefficients of |alpha> and |-alpha> are equal in magnitude and opposite in phase, perhaps the state is a coherent state centered at zero, which would make it Gaussian. For example, if cos(phi) = sin(phi), meaning phi = ±pi/4, and with appropriate signs, the state might be a coherent state at zero.

Wait, let me compute N for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

As before, N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*(-pi/4)) exp(-2*(0.5)^2 )) = sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2) exp(-0.5)) ) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Then, the state is |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ] / N.

Which is [ (sqrt(2)/2) |0.5> + (-sqrt(2)/2) |-0.5> ] / N.

But wait, |0.5> is a coherent state with amplitude 0.5, and |-0.5> is amplitude -0.5. So perhaps the state can be rewritten as a superposition where the two terms are symmetric around zero.

Wait, perhaps |0.5> + |-0.5> is a state with some properties. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be written as a displaced thermal state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a coherent state, but I don't see how that's possible.

Wait, perhaps when phi = -pi/4, the state becomes a coherent state. Let me see: 

If |psi> is ( |alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2), then perhaps it can be rewritten as a different coherent state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the density matrix rho of |psi> is a Gaussian state, but that's unlikely for a superposition of two distinct coherent states.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the relative entropy again. The relative entropy between rho and tau is zero only if rho is Gaussian. So if the state is Gaussian, nG is zero.

But for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which should be non-Gaussian, so nG should be non-zero.

But wait, perhaps the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. How?

A squeezed state can be written as a superposition of coherent states. For example, the squeezed vacuum state is a superposition of even or odd coherent states. So perhaps in this case, with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, but the given state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. For this to be a squeezed state, perhaps the parameters must satisfy certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps when sin(2 phi) is negative and exp(-2 alpha^2) is small, the state becomes a squeezed state.

But I'm not well-versed in this area. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0 because the state is a Gaussian state, but I'm not sure. But I don't have enough information to confirm this.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state is a Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity is zero.

But I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about what the correct answer is. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

Given that the state is a superposition of two coherent states, it's more likely to be non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would be positive, making the correct answer either A, B, or C. But I'm not sure which one.

Wait, perhaps the state is a cat state, which has high non-Gaussianity. But the options include 2.48, which is a relatively large value. So perhaps the correct answer is A) 2.48.

But I'm not confident, but given the options and the problem statement, I'm going to make an educated guess that the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. So the correct answer is D) 0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \). The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\text{nG} = \text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Structure**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are generally non-Gaussian due to interference terms in their density matrices.

2. **Parameters**: For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(-\pi/4) = \pm \sqrt{2}/2\), the state simplifies to:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 |0.5\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 |-0.5\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   The normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

3. **Gaussianity of the State**: A superposition of two coherent states is generally non-Gaussian unless specific conditions are met. For example, if the coefficients of the superposition make the state equivalent to a Gaussian state like a coherent state or a squeezed state. However, for \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state remains a superposition of two distinct coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

4. **Relative Entropy Measure**: The relative entropy \(\text{nG}\) measures the difference in entropy between the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). For a Gaussian state, \(\text{nG} = 0\) because \(\rho = \tau\). For a non-Gaussian state, \(\text{nG}\) is positive.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (2.48)**: This is a relatively large value for non-Gaussianity, which might correspond to a highly non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option B (0.25)**: This is a small positive value, suggesting a weakly non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option C (1.38)**: This is an intermediate value, indicating moderate non-Gaussianity.
   - **Option D (0)**: This implies the state is Gaussian, which contradicts the structure of the given state as a superposition of two coherent states.

### Conclusion:
The state is a superposition of two coherent states, making it non-Gaussian. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, ruling out Option D. However, the exact value of \(\text{nG}\) depends on the specific reference Gaussian state and the relative entropy calculation, which is not explicitly detailed in the problem. Given the options, the most plausible answer is **D) 0**, as it aligns with the interpretation that the state might reduce to a Gaussian state under the given parameters.

Answer: D
