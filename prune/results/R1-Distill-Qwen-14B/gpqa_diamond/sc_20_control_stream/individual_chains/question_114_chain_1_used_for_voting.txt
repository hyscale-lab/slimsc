Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called Reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source like NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins involves adding a nitrile group to a ketone. The reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. So, the butan-2-one would add CN- in an acid-catalyzed mechanism. The product is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the product structure makes sense: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So Reagent A is probably H3O+ because that's the typical acid used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. There's a benzyl group attached to another phenyl ring, specifically at the 4 position, and that's connected via a chain to a hydroxyl and nitrile group on the same carbon. The reagent B is H2O, and the product is the corresponding carboxylic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). I need to recall the conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion. I think hydrolysis is involved. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, you typically use HCl (like HCl in H2O or with heat). Wait, but sometimes it's done with strong acids. Alternatively, maybe it's using a strong acid like HCl as a catalyst in a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O, but the reaction also needs an acid catalyst. Let me think. If the nitrile is hydrolyzed in acidic aqueous conditions, like with HCl (H2O and HCl), that would protonate the nitrile, and then water attacks. The reaction would proceed through some steps, maybe involving an intermediate imidamide or something else, but the end result is the formation of the carboxylic acid.

Looking back at the options, Reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 in the options. Reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, for the first reaction, the correct Reagent A is H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So when looking at the options, the choices for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+, which narrows down the options to either A or B.

Now for Reagent B: The second reaction requires the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid. So the reagents should be a strong acid in water. HCl is a strong acid, so if B is HCl, that would fit. Alternatively, if the reaction uses a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH), would that be enough? Wait, but carboxylic acid formation from nitriles typically requires stronger acidic conditions. Maybe concentrated HCl is needed. So looking at the options, Reagent B is either HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Putting it together: Reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and Reagent B is HCl (so options A or C). So the only option that fits both is option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Wait, let me double-check. For the second reaction, if B is HCl, that's a strong acid which would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. So yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but why is there an option with B as CH3COOH? Maybe I'm mixing up conditions. Another thought: sometimes, nitriles are hydrolyzed under basic conditions to form carboxylic acids, but that's usually with heating and using a base like NaOH, followed by acid work-up. But in this case, the reagent is H2O and B. If B is a weak acid like acetic acid, would that work?

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done in acidic conditions. For example, in HCl in water, under reflux. So in the second reaction, H2O is present, so the reagent B must be providing the acid. So if B is HCl, then it's HCl in H2O, which is the right condition.

So, Reagent B must be HCl. That means looking at the options, only option A has B as HCl. So the correct combination is A: H3O+ and B: HCl.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically proceeds via acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition, where the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, confirms that the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable acid for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the compound 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions. HCl in water is a strong acid that facilitates this transformation effectively. While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid, it is less likely to provide the necessary acidic strength for this reaction.

Considering the options, the combination of A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl satisfies both reactions. H₃O⁺ is the correct acid for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is the appropriate reagent for the nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.
