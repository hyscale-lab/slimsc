Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm. The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it's the opposite of what it emits. Like, if something emits green light, it probably absorbed the complementary color, which would be magenta or something. But wait, that's about color addition, right? For example, in the RGB color model, red + green makes yellow, and so on. But how does that relate to light absorption and emission?

Oh, right! The dye emits light when it reemits the energy it absorbed. So the energy of the emitted light is less than the energy it absorbed. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it drops back, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the difference between the two states.

Wait, but in this question, the emitted energy is given. So the energy absorbed would be higher. Because the emitted energy is the energy difference. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (like blue or violet) and then emits a lower energy photon (like red or another color). Or is it the other way around?

Let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is lower than the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorb) because the molecule is going from a higher energy state to a lower one when emitting. So E_absorb = E_emit + something.

Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets promoted to a higher energy state. Then, perhaps it loses some energy through other means, and when it emits a photon, it's from that higher state to a lower state. So the emitted photon's energy would be the difference between the higher and lower states. So E_emit = E_higher - E_lower.

But since the molecule absorbed a photon with energy E_absorb, which would be equal to E_higher - E_ground? Or maybe E_absorb is the energy that promoted it from ground to higher state, so E_absorb = E_higher - E_ground. Then, when it emits, E_emit = E_higher - E_lower, which would be less than E_absorb if E_lower is higher than the ground state. Hmm, not sure if that's the right way.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state, or another lower state. But the key point is that the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon.

So, if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy must be higher than that.

Wait, but the question is about the absorbed color. So the dye absorbs a certain wavelength, which corresponds to a certain energy. Since higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths (higher frequency), so higher energy corresponds to violet or blue, lower energy to red or yellow.

So, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed light must be higher than that. Let me calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV to see what color it is.

I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J*s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is wavelength.

But wait, E is given in eV. To convert eV to Joules, I multiply by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So E = 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately ?

Let me compute that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = around 3.746e-19 J.

Then, λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J*s, c=3e8 m/s.

So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J*m.

So λ = (1.9878e-25 J*m) / (3.746e-19 J) ≈ 5.298e-7 meters, which is 529.8 nm.

Wait, 529 nm is in the green range. Because red is around 650 nm, green is about 500-570, so 530 is green.

Wait, but wait, wait. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So if the molecule is emitting that, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon would have a higher energy, which corresponds to a shorter wavelength (higher frequency), so the absorbed light is of a higher energy, which is blue or violet perhaps.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is 530 nm (green), then what color is absorbed? Because the absorbed photon has higher energy, which would be blue (around 450 nm, higher energy than green). Or perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So the molecule must have absorbed higher energy light, which is blue or violet.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the energy gap in the molecule, which is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state, corresponds to the absorbed photon's energy. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon of that energy, it gets excited.

But when it emits, it might not emit the same photon. It could emit a lower energy photon if it doesn't go all the way back to the ground state. Hmm, but that's fluorescence or phosphorescence. But in this case, the question says the dye emits light, which I think is fluorescence.

Wait, but for fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy photon. So the emitted photon has a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed one. So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted energy.

So, if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy is higher than that.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than emitted. So what color is that?

The emitted wavelength is about 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon would be higher energy, shorter wavelength. For example, blue is around 450 nm (4.45 eV?), wait no. Let me think about the energy.

Wait, let me compute the energy for 450 nm (blue) and 400 nm (violet).

E = hc/λ.

For λ=450 nm = 450e-9 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (450e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (450e-9) ≈ 4.417e-19 J.

Convert that to eV: 4.417e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Similarly, for 400 nm (violet):

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(400e-9) = (1.9878e-25)/(400e-9) ≈ 4.9695e-19 J.

In eV: 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

So the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV, so it's either violet (~3.10 eV) or blue (~2.75 eV). Or maybe even higher.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, so either blue or violet.

But what's the color absorbed? The question is asking which color is absorbed. So if the dye emits green (530 nm, 2.34 eV), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like blue or violet.

So the absorbed photon is of higher energy, so the color absorbed is of a higher energy than the emitted. Let me see the options again.

Options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Red is about 1.9 eV (650 nm), which is lower than 2.34 eV. So the emitted is higher than red. So the absorbed must be higher than 2.34 eV.

So possible colors for absorption are violet (~3.1 eV) or blue (~2.75 eV). So looking at the options, violet and blue are the possibilities.

Wait, but wait. The question asks what color is absorbed. So the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (so higher frequency, shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

So the absorbed photon would be blue or violet.

Wait, but the options include both B (violet) and C (blue). So how do I choose between them?

Hmm. How does conjugation affect the energy gap? Extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap. Because conjugation allows for longer pi systems, which have lower energy transitions.

So the energy gap (E) is inversely related to the length of the conjugated system. So if the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. Which means the energy of the absorbed photon is lower.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the photon absorbed is the energy gap between the ground and excited state. So for a larger conjugated system, the energy gap (E) is smaller. So the absorbed photon has lower energy.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon is lower energy than if the system were less conjugated.

Wait, but in this question, the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, so the energy gap is small. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon is lower. But wait, that would make the emitted photon even lower. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is the energy of the absorbed photon. When the molecule absorbs a photon of that energy, it's promoted to the excited state. Then, when it emits a photon, perhaps it doesn't go all the way back to the ground state. It could emit a photon with a lower energy, corresponding to a smaller energy drop.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the molecule goes from the excited state to a lower energy state (not necessarily the ground state), so the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed photon. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So in this question, the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

But wait, the molecule's conjugated system affects the energy gap. A longer conjugation (more atoms in the pi system) leads to a smaller energy gap. So the energy required (E) for the transition is lower. Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is lower.

Wait, but that would suggest that the absorbed photon is lower energy than the emitted, which contradicts what I thought before. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and another state (like a lower excited state or the ground state). So the energy of the emitted photon is related to the difference between the excited state and this lower state, which might be smaller than the energy gap between ground and first excited state.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon’s energy because it's the energy gap between ground and excited.

So, in the case of a large conjugated system, the energy gap (E) is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy is lower than it would be for a smaller conjugated system.

Wait, but the problem states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So in this case, the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy (the energy gap) must be higher than that.

Wait, but if the molecule has an extensively conjugated pi system, the energy gap (E) is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than for a less conjugated system. But wait, this would mean that if the energy gap is smaller than the emitted photon, the emitted photon can’t be higher than the absorbed.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which corresponds to a shorter wavelength (violet or blue).

But the molecule has an extensively conjugated pi system, which leads to lower energy gaps. So the energy of the absorbed photon (the gap) is smaller than it would be for a less conjugated system. Wait, but if the gap is smaller, the absorbed photon has lower energy. That can't be, because the emitted photon is 2.34 eV, which is higher than what the gap would allow.

Hmm, maybe I have this backwards.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the energy of the absorbed photon minus some other energy loss. So E_emit = E_absorb - (other losses). So E_absorb = E_emit + (losses). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So E_absorb > E_emit.

Given that, the absorbed photon will be higher in energy than the emitted.

So, the emitted photon is 2.34 eV (green), so the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so blue or violet.

But, the molecule has extensive conjugation. So the energy gap is smaller than for a less conjugated molecule. So for a smaller energy gap (E), the absorbed photon's wavelength is longer (lower energy) than for a molecule with a larger energy gap.

Wait, but a larger conjugated system leads to a smaller energy gap (E). So the energy of the absorbed photon is lower.

Wait, but that would mean E_absorb < E_emit, which contradicts because E_absorb must be higher than E_emit.

Hmm, that can't be. There's something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon minus some energy loss (like in fluorescence, some energy is lost as heat). But then, E_emit = E_absorb - (loss). So E_absorb = E_emit + loss.

So in that case, E_absorb is higher than E_emit. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher, thus shorter wavelength.

So, the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted.

So, the problem is: the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, which is green, so the absorbed photon must be higher. So absorbed in blue or violet.

But the molecule has extensive conjugation, which causes the energy gap to be lower. So the E_absorb is lower than it would be for a molecule with less conjugation.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because if the molecule has a small E_absorb, then E_emit would be less than E_absorb, which is correct, but I'm not sure if that affects the color.

Wait, but the question is what color is absorbed. So the absorbed photon is of a higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

So, looking at the options, the options for absorbed are violet (B) or blue (C). So which one is it?

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. What is that in nanometers? Let me calculate that accurately.

E = 2.3393 eV.

E (in Joules) = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = 3.745e-19 J.

λ = hc / E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 3.745e-19 J = approx 5.298e-7 m = 529.8 nm, which is green. So the emitted photon is green.

The absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength (higher frequency). So the absorbed photon is either blue (around 450 nm, 2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the color absorbed would be the color of the photon with higher energy than emitted. So the dye must have absorbed a photon with energy higher than 2.3393 eV. So the color is either blue or violet.

But looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is it?

Wait, but wait. Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is shorter than 529.8 nm. So the color is either blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm). So higher energy than 2.34 eV.

Now, what's the exact energy for 400 nm? Let me compute that.

E = 1240 / λ (in nm) eV.

Because 1 eV·nm = 1.602e-19 J·nm, but the formula E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm) is a handy approximation.

So for λ=400 nm: E=1240/400=3.1 eV.

For λ=450 nm: E=1240/450≈2.76 eV.

Wait, but 2.76 eV is higher than 2.34 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV), which is higher than 2.34 eV.

Alternatively, if the energy of the absorbed photon is, say, 3.1 eV (violet), that's also higher.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet. But the question is about the color absorbed. So which one is it?

But the options have both, so how do I choose?

Wait, perhaps the molecule emits in the green, which is around 529 nm. So the absorbed photon is blue or violet. But which one has higher energy than 2.34 eV?

Well, both blue and violet have higher energy than green. So the question is, which of these corresponds to the energy gap of an extensively conjugated system.

Wait, extensive conjugation leads to a lower energy gap (E). So the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorb) is lower than it would be without conjugation. For example, if without conjugation, the E_absorb might be higher, say, 3.5 eV. But with conjugation, E_absorb is lower, perhaps 2.7 eV.

Wait, so if the dye has extensive conjugation, the E_absorb is lower than it would be for a non-conjugated system. So the E_absorb is around 2.7 eV, which is blue.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.34 eV. Since E_absorb must be higher than that, and if the conjugation reduces the E_absorb, then the E_absorb is just a bit higher than 2.34 eV. Let's say E_absorb is around 2.4 eV, which would be in the blue region?

Wait, 2.4 eV is E_absorb. So λ_absorb = 1240 / 2.4 ≈ 516 nm, which is green. But that's the same as emitted. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, no. The emitted photon's wavelength is 529 nm. The absorbed photon's wavelength must be shorter (higher energy) than that. So if E_absorb is higher than 2.34 eV, which would correspond to wavelengths less than 529 nm. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is in the blue or violet range.

But how does the extent of conjugation affect this? Extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap, meaning E_absorb is lower. So if without conjugation, E_absorb was higher (say, 3.0 eV, 413 nm, violet), but with extensive conjugation, E_absorb is lower, say 2.5 eV, which is 496 nm, blue.

Ah, so in this case, the absorbed photon would be blue (496 nm, 2.5 eV), which is higher than 2.34 eV (green).

So the color absorbed is blue.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute E_absorb.

Given E_emit = 2.3393 eV, which is 529 nm.

Assuming that the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state (E_absorb) is higher than E_emit, because E_emit is the energy difference between two states, maybe the first excited state and a lower state.

Wait, but the emitted photon's energy is E_emit = E_high - E_lower, while the absorbed photon's energy is E_absorb = E_high - E_ground.

So if E_ground is the ground state, and E_lower is a state higher than the ground state, then E_absorb is higher than E_emit.

So, in any case, E_absorb > E_emit.

But in terms of conjugation, extensive conjugation leads to a lower HOMO-LUMO gap. So the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorb) is lower than in a less conjugated system.

But E_absorb must still be higher than E_emit.

So, let's say without conjugation, E_absorb is higher (violet). With conjugation, E_absorb is lower (blue).

So, in this case, it would be blue.

So looking at the options, option C is blue.

Alternatively, if the molecule absorbed violet light, which is higher energy than blue, but if the conjugation lowers E_absorb, then maybe the absorbed photon is blue.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is blue.

But then, I thought that the emitted photon was 530 nm (green). So if the molecule absorbed blue light (450 nm, 2.75 eV), which is higher than 2.34 eV, which makes sense.

So the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.

To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted and absorbed photons. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 529.8 nm (green light). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon because the molecule absorbs energy to reach a higher energy state and then emits energy when it transitions to a lower energy state.

The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in meters. For convenience, the energy in electron volts (eV) can also be approximated using:

\[
E (\text{eV}) = \frac{1240}{\lambda (\text{nm})}
\]

The emitted photon energy is 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength of 529.8 nm (green). The absorbed photon must have a higher energy, meaning its wavelength is shorter (higher frequency). For example:
- Blue light (450 nm) corresponds to \( E = \frac{1240}{450} \approx 2.76 \, \text{eV} \),
- Violet light (400 nm) corresponds to \( E = \frac{1240}{400} = 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).

Thus, the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. However, the molecule has an extensively conjugated \(\pi\)-electron system, which lowers the energy gap (HOMO-LUMO gap) between the ground and excited states. This means the absorbed photon's energy is slightly higher than the emitted photon's energy, corresponding to a wavelength in the blue region (around 450 nm).

Given the options:
- **A) Red**: Incorrect, as red light has lower energy (around 1.9 eV) and longer wavelength (650 nm), which is lower than the emitted photon's energy.
- **B) Violet**: Incorrect, as violet light has higher energy (3.1 eV) than the emitted photon, but the extensive conjugation suggests the energy gap is smaller, favoring blue light.
- **C) Blue**: Correct, as blue light (2.76 eV) has higher energy than the emitted photon and aligns with the reduced energy gap due to conjugation.
- **D) Yellow**: Incorrect, as yellow light has lower energy (around 2.0 eV) and longer wavelength (570 nm), which is lower than the emitted photon's energy.

Thus, the absorbed photon corresponds to blue light. 

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm. The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state, or another lower state. But the key point is that the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon.

So, if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy must be higher than that.

Wait, but the question is about the absorbed color. So the dye absorbs a certain wavelength, which corresponds to a certain energy. Since higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths (higher frequency), so higher energy corresponds to violet or blue, lower energy to red or yellow.

So, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed light must be higher than that. Let me calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV to see what color it is.

I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J*s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is wavelength.

But wait, E is given in eV. To convert eV to Joules, I multiply by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So E = 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately ?

Let me compute that: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = around 3.746e-19 J.

Then, λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J*s, c=3e8 m/s.

So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J*m.

So λ = (1.9878e-25 J*m) / (3.746e-19 J) ≈ 5.298e-7 meters, which is 529.8 nm.

Wait, 529 nm is in the green range. Because red is around 650 nm, green is about 500-570, so 530 is green.

Wait, but wait, wait. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So if the molecule is emitting that, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon would have a higher energy, which corresponds to a shorter wavelength (higher frequency), so the absorbed light is of a higher energy, which is blue or violet perhaps.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is 530 nm (green), then what color is absorbed? Because the absorbed photon has higher energy, which would be blue (around 450 nm, higher energy than green). Or perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So the molecule must have absorbed higher energy light, which is blue or violet.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the energy gap in the molecule, which is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state, corresponds to the absorbed photon's energy. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon of that energy, it gets excited.

But when it emits, it might not emit the same photon. It could emit a lower energy photon if it doesn't go all the way back to the ground state. Hmm, but that's fluorescence or phosphorescence. But in this case, the question says the dye emits light, which I think is fluorescence.

Wait, but for fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy photon. So the emitted photon has a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed one. So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted energy.

So, if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy is higher than that.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy than emitted. So what color is that?

The emitted wavelength is about 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon would be higher energy, shorter wavelength. For example, blue is around 450 nm (4.45 eV?), wait no. Let me think about the energy.

Wait, let me compute the energy for 450 nm (blue) and 400 nm (violet).

E = hc/λ.

For λ=450 nm = 450e-9 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (450e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (450e-9) ≈ 4.417e-19 J.

Convert that to eV: 4.417e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Similarly, for 400 nm (violet):

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(400e-9) = (1.9878e-25)/(400e-9) ≈ 4.9695e-19 J.

In eV: 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

So the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV, so it's either violet (~3.10 eV) or blue (~2.75 eV). Or maybe even higher.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, so either blue or violet.

But what's the color absorbed? The question is asking which color is absorbed. So if the dye emits green (530 nm, 2.34 eV), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like blue or violet.

So the absorbed photon is of higher energy, so the color absorbed is of a higher energy than the emitted. Let me see the options again.

Options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Red is about 1.9 eV (650 nm), which is lower than 2.34 eV. So the emitted is higher than red. So the absorbed must be higher than 2.34 eV.

So possible colors for absorption are violet (~3.1 eV) or blue (~2.75 eV). So looking at the options, violet and blue are the possibilities.

Wait, but wait. The question asks what color is absorbed. So the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (so higher frequency, shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

So the absorbed photon would be blue or violet.

Wait, but the options include both B (violet) and C (blue). So how do I choose between them?

Hmm. How does conjugation affect the energy gap? Extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap. Because conjugation allows for longer pi systems, which have lower energy transitions.

So the energy gap (E) is inversely related to the length of the conjugated system. So if the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. Which means the energy of the absorbed photon is lower.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the photon absorbed is the energy gap between the ground and excited state. So for a larger conjugated system, the energy gap (E) is smaller. So the absorbed photon has lower energy.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon is lower energy than if the system were less conjugated.

Wait, but in this question, the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, so the energy gap is small. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon is lower. But wait, that would make the emitted photon even lower. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is the energy of the absorbed photon. When the molecule absorbs a photon of that energy, it's promoted to the excited state. Then, when it emits a photon, perhaps it doesn't go all the way back to the ground state. It could emit a photon with a lower energy, corresponding to a smaller energy drop.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the molecule goes from the excited state to a lower energy state (not necessarily the ground state), so the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed photon. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So in this question, the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

But wait, the molecule's conjugated system affects the energy gap. A longer conjugation (more atoms in the pi system) leads to a smaller energy gap. So the energy required (E) for the transition is lower. Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is lower.

Wait, but that would suggest that the absorbed photon is lower energy than the emitted, which contradicts what I thought before. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and another state (like a lower excited state or the ground state). So the energy of the emitted photon is related to the difference between the excited state and this lower state, which might be smaller than the energy gap between ground and first excited state.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon’s energy because it's the energy gap between ground and excited.

So, in the case of a large conjugated system, the energy gap (E) is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy is lower than it would be for a smaller conjugated system.

Wait, but the problem states that the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So in this case, the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy (the energy gap) must be higher than that.

Wait, but if the molecule has an extensively conjugated pi system, the energy gap (E) is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than for a less conjugated system. But wait, this would mean that if the energy gap is smaller than the emitted photon, the emitted photon can’t be higher than the absorbed.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which corresponds to a shorter wavelength (violet or blue).

But the molecule has an extensively conjugated pi system, which leads to lower energy gaps. So the energy of the absorbed photon (the gap) is smaller than it would be for a less conjugated system. Wait, but if the gap is smaller, the absorbed photon has lower energy. That can't be, because the emitted photon is 2.34 eV, which is higher than what the gap would allow.

Hmm, maybe I have this backwards.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the energy of the absorbed photon minus some other energy loss. So E_emit = E_absorb - (other losses). So E_absorb = E_emit + (losses). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So E_absorb > E_emit.

Given that, the absorbed photon will be higher in energy than the emitted.

So, the emitted photon is 2.34 eV (green), so the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so blue or violet.

But, the molecule has extensive conjugation. So the energy gap is smaller than for a less conjugated molecule. So for a smaller energy gap (E), the absorbed photon's wavelength is longer (lower energy) than for a molecule with a larger energy gap.

Wait, but a larger conjugated system leads to a smaller energy gap (E). So the energy of the absorbed photon is lower.

Wait, but that would mean E_absorb < E_emit, which contradicts because E_absorb must be higher than E_emit.

Hmm, that can't be. There's something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon minus some energy loss (like in fluorescence, some energy is lost as heat). But then, E_emit = E_absorb - (loss). So E_absorb = E_emit + loss.

So in that case, E_absorb is higher than E_emit. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher, thus shorter wavelength.

So, the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted.

So, the problem is: the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, which is green, so the absorbed photon must be higher. So absorbed in blue or violet.

But the molecule has extensive conjugation, which causes the energy gap to be lower. So the E_absorb is lower than it would be for a molecule with less conjugation.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because if the molecule has a small E_absorb, then E_emit would be less than E_absorb, which is correct, but I'm not sure if that affects the color.

Wait, but the question is what color is absorbed. So the absorbed photon is of a higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

So, looking at the options, the options for absorbed are violet (B) or blue (C). So which one is it?

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. What is that in nanometers? Let me calculate that accurately.

E = 2.3393 eV.

E (in Joules) = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = 3.745e-19 J.

λ = hc / E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 3.745e-19 J = approx 5.298e-7 m = 529.8 nm, which is green. So the emitted photon is green.

The absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength (higher frequency). So the absorbed photon is either blue (around 450 nm, 2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the color absorbed would be the color of the photon with higher energy than emitted. So the dye must have absorbed a photon with energy higher than 2.3393 eV. So the color is either blue or violet.

But looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is it?

Wait, but wait. Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is shorter than 529.8 nm. So the color is either blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm). So higher energy than 2.34 eV.

Now, what's the exact energy for 400 nm? Let me compute that.

E = 1240 / λ (in nm) eV.

Because 1 eV·nm = 1.602e-19 J·nm, but the formula E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm) is a handy approximation.

So for λ=400 nm: E=1240/400=3.1 eV.

For λ=450 nm: E=1240/450≈2.76 eV.

Wait, but 2.76 eV is higher than 2.34 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV), which is higher than 2.34 eV.

Alternatively, if the energy of the absorbed photon is, say, 3.1 eV (violet), that's also higher.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet. But the question is about the color absorbed. So which one is it?

But the options have both, so how do I choose?

Wait, perhaps the molecule emits in the green, which is around 529 nm. So the absorbed photon is blue or violet. But which one has higher energy than 2.34 eV?

Well, both blue and violet have higher energy than green. So the question is, which of these corresponds to the energy gap of an extensively conjugated system.

Wait, extensive conjugation leads to a lower energy gap (E). So the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorb) is lower than it would be without conjugation. For example, if without conjugation, the E_absorb might be higher, say, 3.5 eV. But with conjugation, E_absorb is lower, perhaps 2.7 eV.

Wait, so if the dye has extensive conjugation, the E_absorb is lower than it would be for a non-conjugated system. So the E_absorb is around 2.7 eV, which is blue.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.34 eV. Since E_absorb must be higher than that, and if the conjugation reduces the E_absorb, then the E_absorb is just a bit higher than 2.34 eV. Let's say E_absorb is around 2.4 eV, which would be in the blue region?

Wait, 2.4 eV is E_absorb. So λ_absorb = 1240 / 2.4 ≈ 516 nm, which is green. But that's the same as emitted. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, no. The emitted photon's wavelength is 529 nm. The absorbed photon's wavelength must be shorter (higher energy) than that. So if E_absorb is higher than 2.34 eV, which would correspond to wavelengths less than 529 nm. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is in the blue or violet range.

But how does the extent of conjugation affect this? Extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap, meaning E_absorb is lower. So if without conjugation, E_absorb was higher (say, 3.0 eV, 413 nm, violet), but with extensive conjugation, E_absorb is lower, say 2.5 eV, which is 496 nm, blue.

Ah, so in this case, the absorbed photon would be blue (496 nm, 2.5 eV), which is higher than 2.34 eV (green).

So the color absorbed is blue.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute E_absorb.

Given E_emit = 2.3393 eV, which is 529 nm.

Assuming that the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state (E_absorb) is higher than E_emit, because E_emit is the energy difference between two states, maybe the first excited state and a lower state.

Wait, but the emitted photon's energy is E_emit = E_high - E_lower, while the absorbed photon's energy is E_absorb = E_high - E_ground.

So if E_ground is the ground state, and E_lower is a state higher than the ground state, then E_absorb is higher than E_emit.

So, in any case, E_absorb > E_emit.

But in terms of conjugation, extensive conjugation leads to a lower HOMO-LUMO gap. So the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorb) is lower than in a less conjugated system.

But E_absorb must still be higher than E_emit.

So, let's say without conjugation, E_absorb is higher (violet). With conjugation, E_absorb is lower (blue).

So, in this case, it would be blue.

So looking at the options, option C is blue.

Alternatively, if the molecule absorbed violet light, which is higher energy than blue, but if the conjugation lowers E_absorb, then maybe the absorbed photon is blue.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is blue.

But then, I thought that the emitted photon was 530 nm (green). So if the molecule absorbed blue light (450 nm, 2.75 eV), which is higher than 2.34 eV, which makes sense.

So the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted and absorbed photons. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 529.8 nm (green light). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon because the molecule absorbs energy to reach a higher energy state and then emits energy when it transitions to a lower energy state.

The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in meters. For convenience, the energy in electron volts (eV) can also be approximated using:

\[
E (\text{eV}) = \frac{1240}{\lambda (\text{nm})}
\]

The emitted photon energy is 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength of 529.8 nm (green). The absorbed photon must have a higher energy, meaning its wavelength is shorter (higher frequency). For example:
- Blue light (450 nm) corresponds to \( E = \frac{1240}{450} \approx 2.76 \, \text{eV} \),
- Violet light (400 nm) corresponds to \( E = \frac{1240}{400} = 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).

Thus, the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. However, the molecule has an extensively conjugated \(\pi\)-electron system, which lowers the energy gap (HOMO-LUMO gap) between the ground and excited states. This means the absorbed photon's energy is slightly higher than the emitted photon's energy, corresponding to a wavelength in the blue region (around 450 nm).

Given the options:
- **A) Red**: Incorrect, as red light has lower energy (around 1.9 eV) and longer wavelength (650 nm), which is lower than the emitted photon's energy.
- **B) Violet**: Incorrect, as violet light has higher energy (3.1 eV) than the emitted photon, but the extensive conjugation suggests the energy gap is smaller, favoring blue light.
- **C) Blue**: Correct, as blue light (2.76 eV) has higher energy than the emitted photon and aligns with the reduced energy gap due to conjugation.
- **D) Yellow**: Incorrect, as yellow light has lower energy (around 2.0 eV) and longer wavelength (570 nm), which is lower than the emitted photon's energy.

Thus, the absorbed photon corresponds to blue light. 

Answer: C
