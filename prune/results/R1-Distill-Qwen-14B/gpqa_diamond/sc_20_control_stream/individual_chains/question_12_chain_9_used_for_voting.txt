Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and their decay is an important process in particle physics. Let me see what I can remember about this.

The question states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². I need to find the kinetic energy of each product.

Wait, right, when a particle is at rest and decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Because the neutrino is massless (I think), that might simplify things. Oh wait, the neutrino's mass is very small but maybe for this problem, we can take it as zero.

So, let me think about conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energy of each particle is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Or wait, no – the muon has rest mass, so its total energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because m=0.

So the total energy after decay is (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu. But the initial energy is m_pi c². So,

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But also, because the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other. Let me denote the momentum magnitudes as p_mu and p_nu. So p_mu = p_nu (since they're opposite in direction).

But wait, for the muon, the momentum is related to its energy. The energy of the muon is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). And the neutrino's energy is just p_nu c, since it's massless.

So, since p_mu = p_nu = p, let's write that.

So the total energy equation becomes:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, I can write this equation in terms of p. Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), E_nu = p c.

So m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

Substituting E_mu:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.

Let me let x = p c. Then,

m_pi c² = sqrt(x^2 + m_mu² c^4) + x.

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(x^2 + m_mu² c^4) = m_pi c² - x.

Square both sides:

x^2 + m_mu² c^4 = (m_pi c² - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

= m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x².

So, x^2 + m_mu² c^4 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

m_mu² c^4 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x.

Rearrange terms:

2 m_pi c² x = m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4.

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c²:

x = [ (m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ) / (2 m_pi c²) ) ]

Factor out c^4:

x = [ c^4 (m_pi² - m_mu²) ) ] / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )

Simplify:

x = c^2 (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi )

So x = (c^2) ( (m_pi - m_mu)(m_pi + m_mu) ) / (2 m_pi )

But since m_pi > m_mu, it's positive.

Wait, but we can compute this numerically now.

Given:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²

m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

So let's compute m_pi² and m_mu².

m_pi² = (139.6)^2 ≈ let me calculate:

139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So,

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m_mu² = (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140.

So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi² = 19488.16 (MeV²/c^4), m_mu²=11172.49.

So m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV²/c^4.

Then x = (c^2) * (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) )

Wait, let me compute this. Let me calculate denominator first: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 =8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, but 8315.67 is less than that. Let me think, 279.2 * 29.7 → 29.7 *279.2.

Wait, maybe a better approach: 8315.67 / 279.2.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate: 279.2 * 29 = 8315.67? Let's compute 279.2 * 29.

279.2 * 30 = 8376. Subtract 279.2: 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait, but 279.2 *29 = 8096.8. But our numerator is 8315.67, which is larger.

So 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87 left.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So total x ≈ 29.783 c² MeV.

Wait, wait, no. Because:

Wait, x = [ (m_pi² - m_mu²) * c² ] / (2 m_pi) )

Wait, the units are a bit confusing. Let me make sure.

Wait, m_pi and m_mu are in MeV/c². So when I compute (m_pi² - m_mu²), that's (MeV²/c^4). Multiply by c^2 gives MeV²/(c^2). Then divided by (2 m_pi) which is (2 MeV/c²). So units:

(MeV² / c²) / (MeV / c²) ) → MeV.

Wait, so x is in units of MeV/c? Because x = p c, since x is p c.

Wait, p is in MeV c / c^2? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of units.

But perhaps I should just proceed numerically.

So x = (8315.67 MeV²/c^4 * c^2 ) / (2 * 139.6 MeV/c² )

Wait, simplifying the units:

Numerator: MeV²/c^4 * c^2 = MeV²/(c^2)

Denominator: MeV/c².

So overall units: (MeV²/c^2 ) / (MeV/c²) ) = MeV.

So x is in MeV.

Wait, but x is p c. So p = x / c. So if x is in MeV, then p would be in MeV/c.

Wait, maybe I don't need to worry about units for now; let's just compute the value.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV. So p c = 29.783 MeV. So p = 29.783 / c → but maybe I don't need to compute p directly.

Now, I can find the kinetic energies.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c^2 )^2 ) - m_mu c^2.

Wait, because the rest energy is m_mu c^2, so the kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest energy.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) - 105.7.

Compute sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.783 squared: approx 29.78^2 ≈ 886.8. 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29.

Square root of 12059.29: what's sqrt(12059.29)?

Well, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.29) is a bit less than 110.

Approximately 109.8 or so.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + (0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

Hmm, but our sum is 12059.29. So 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is 3.25 less than 12059.29.

So the next decimal: 109.8 + delta.

Let me compute 109.8^2 = 12056.04.

We need to reach 12059.29, which is 3.25 higher.

Each 0.1 increase in x adds about 2*109.8 *0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1. Wait, but wait, it's (109.8 + 0.1)^2 – 109.8^2 = 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 + 0.01 = 21.97.

So to get 3.25, that's about 3.25/21.97 ≈ 0.147 of 0.1.

So 0.0147.

So sqrt ≈ 109.8 + 0.0147 ≈ 109.8147.

So E_mu ≈ 109.8147 - 105.7 = 4.1147 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.11 MeV.

Then E_nu is x, which is 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p c which is x, so 29.783 MeV, which is its kinetic energy since it's massless.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and about 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close to what I calculated. So the answer must be D.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, when I computed (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2), I think I did it correctly. 139.6^2 is 19488.16, 105.7^2 is 11172.49. The difference is 8315.67, correct.

Then, x = (8315.67) / (2*139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV. Correct.

E_mu is sqrt(29.783^2 + 105.7^2) -105.7.

Which is sqrt(886.95 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.44) ≈ 109.814 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.814 -105.7 = 4.114 MeV. So approximately 4.11 MeV.

E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches closely.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino after the stationary pion decays, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \( m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), while the neutrino is massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy after the decay is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + p_{\nu} c,
\]
where \( p_{\mu} \) and \( p_{\nu} \) are the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino, respectively. Since the pion is stationary, momentum conservation requires \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \). Substituting \( p_{\mu} = p \) and \( p_{\nu} = p \), the equation becomes:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + p c.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Let \( x = p c \). The equation simplifies to:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + x.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} = m_{\pi} c^2 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2 = (m_{\pi} c^2 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2 = m_{\pi}^2 c^4 - 2 m_{\pi} c^2 x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \( x^2 \) and rearranging:
\[
2 m_{\pi} c^2 x = m_{\pi}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4.
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4}{2 m_{\pi} c^2}.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4,
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
\]
Substituting \( x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{886.95 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.44} \approx 109.814 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.814 - 105.7 = 4.114 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\nu} = x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies are approximately \( K_{\mu} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and their decay is an important process in particle physics. Let me see what I can remember about this.

The question states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². I need to find the kinetic energy of each product.

Wait, right, when a particle is at rest and decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Because the neutrino is massless (I think), that might simplify things. Oh wait, the neutrino's mass is very small but maybe for this problem, we can take it as zero.

So, let me think about conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energy of each particle is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Or wait, no – the muon has rest mass, so its total energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because m=0.

So the total energy after decay is (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu. But the initial energy is m_pi c². So,

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But also, because the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other. Let me denote the momentum magnitudes as p_mu and p_nu. So p_mu = p_nu (since they're opposite in direction).

But wait, for the muon, the momentum is related to its energy. The energy of the muon is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). And the neutrino's energy is just p_nu c, since it's massless.

So, since p_mu = p_nu = p, let's write that.

So the total energy equation becomes:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, I can write this equation in terms of p. Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), E_nu = p c.

So m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

Substituting E_mu:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.

Let me let x = p c. Then,

m_pi c² = sqrt(x^2 + m_mu² c^4) + x.

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(x^2 + m_mu² c^4) = m_pi c² - x.

Square both sides:

x^2 + m_mu² c^4 = (m_pi c² - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

= m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x².

So, x^2 + m_mu² c^4 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

m_mu² c^4 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x.

Rearrange terms:

2 m_pi c² x = m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4.

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c²:

x = [ (m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ) / (2 m_pi c²) ) ]

Factor out c^4:

x = [ c^4 (m_pi² - m_mu²) ) ] / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )

Simplify:

x = c^2 (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi )

So x = (c^2) ( (m_pi - m_mu)(m_pi + m_mu) ) / (2 m_pi )

But since m_pi > m_mu, it's positive.

Wait, but we can compute this numerically now.

Given:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²

m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

So let's compute m_pi² and m_mu².

m_pi² = (139.6)^2 ≈ let me calculate:

139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So,

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m_mu² = (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140.

So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi² = 19488.16 (MeV²/c^4), m_mu²=11172.49.

So m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV²/c^4.

Then x = (c^2) * (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) )

Wait, let me compute this. Let me calculate denominator first: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 =8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, but 8315.67 is less than that. Let me think, 279.2 * 29.7 → 29.7 *279.2.

Wait, maybe a better approach: 8315.67 / 279.2.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate: 279.2 * 29 = 8315.67? Let's compute 279.2 * 29.

279.2 * 30 = 8376. Subtract 279.2: 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait, but 279.2 *29 = 8096.8. But our numerator is 8315.67, which is larger.

So 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87 left.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So total x ≈ 29.783 c² MeV.

Wait, wait, no. Because:

Wait, x = [ (m_pi² - m_mu²) * c² ] / (2 m_pi) )

Wait, the units are a bit confusing. Let me make sure.

Wait, m_pi and m_mu are in MeV/c². So when I compute (m_pi² - m_mu²), that's (MeV²/c^4). Multiply by c^2 gives MeV²/(c^2). Then divided by (2 m_pi) which is (2 MeV/c²). So units:

(MeV² / c²) / (MeV / c²) ) → MeV.

Wait, so x is in units of MeV/c? Because x = p c, since x is p c.

Wait, p is in MeV c / c^2? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of units.

But perhaps I should just proceed numerically.

So x = (8315.67 MeV²/c^4 * c^2 ) / (2 * 139.6 MeV/c² )

Wait, simplifying the units:

Numerator: MeV²/c^4 * c^2 = MeV²/(c^2)

Denominator: MeV/c².

So overall units: (MeV²/c^2 ) / (MeV/c²) ) = MeV.

So x is in MeV.

Wait, but x is p c. So p = x / c. So if x is in MeV, then p would be in MeV/c.

Wait, maybe I don't need to worry about units for now; let's just compute the value.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV. So p c = 29.783 MeV. So p = 29.783 / c → but maybe I don't need to compute p directly.

Now, I can find the kinetic energies.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c^2 )^2 ) - m_mu c^2.

Wait, because the rest energy is m_mu c^2, so the kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest energy.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) - 105.7.

Compute sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.783 squared: approx 29.78^2 ≈ 886.8. 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29.

Square root of 12059.29: what's sqrt(12059.29)?

Well, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.29) is a bit less than 110.

Approximately 109.8 or so.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + (0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

Hmm, but our sum is 12059.29. So 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is 3.25 less than 12059.29.

So the next decimal: 109.8 + delta.

Let me compute 109.8^2 = 12056.04.

We need to reach 12059.29, which is 3.25 higher.

Each 0.1 increase in x adds about 2*109.8 *0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1. Wait, but wait, it's (109.8 + 0.1)^2 – 109.8^2 = 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 + 0.01 = 21.97.

So to get 3.25, that's about 3.25/21.97 ≈ 0.147 of 0.1.

So 0.0147.

So sqrt ≈ 109.8 + 0.0147 ≈ 109.8147.

So E_mu ≈ 109.8147 - 105.7 = 4.1147 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.11 MeV.

Then E_nu is x, which is 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p c which is x, so 29.783 MeV, which is its kinetic energy since it's massless.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and about 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close to what I calculated. So the answer must be D.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, when I computed (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2), I think I did it correctly. 139.6^2 is 19488.16, 105.7^2 is 11172.49. The difference is 8315.67, correct.

Then, x = (8315.67) / (2*139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV. Correct.

E_mu is sqrt(29.783^2 + 105.7^2) -105.7.

Which is sqrt(886.95 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.44) ≈ 109.814 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.814 -105.7 = 4.114 MeV. So approximately 4.11 MeV.

E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches closely.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino after the stationary pion decays, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \( m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), while the neutrino is massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy after the decay is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + p_{\nu} c,
\]
where \( p_{\mu} \) and \( p_{\nu} \) are the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino, respectively. Since the pion is stationary, momentum conservation requires \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \). Substituting \( p_{\mu} = p \) and \( p_{\nu} = p \), the equation becomes:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + p c.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Let \( x = p c \). The equation simplifies to:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + x.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} = m_{\pi} c^2 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2 = (m_{\pi} c^2 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2 = m_{\pi}^2 c^4 - 2 m_{\pi} c^2 x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \( x^2 \) and rearranging:
\[
2 m_{\pi} c^2 x = m_{\pi}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4.
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4}{2 m_{\pi} c^2}.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4,
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
\]
Substituting \( x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{886.95 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.44} \approx 109.814 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.814 - 105.7 = 4.114 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\nu} = x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies are approximately \( K_{\mu} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the closest match is:
