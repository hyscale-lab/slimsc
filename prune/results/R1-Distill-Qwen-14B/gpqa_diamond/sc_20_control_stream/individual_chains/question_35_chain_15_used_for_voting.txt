Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c times S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar to this. Oh yeah, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix. That makes sense.

So the operator Ay is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Let me write that out. Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Okay, eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue, and φ is the eigenfunction (eigenvector in matrix terms).

First, let's find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y. Let me compute the components:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] 

So the elements are:
Ay₁₁ = 0
Ay₁₂ = -i (h/(4π))
Ay₂₁ = i (h/(4π))
Ay₂₂ = 0

So the matrix Ay looks like:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

The characteristic equation is:

det( Ay - a I ) = 0
=> | (-a)   (-i h/(4π)) |
   | (i h/(4π))  (-a)   | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So expanding that:

a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1. So (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (h²/(4π)^2) * 1 ] = 0

So equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π² ) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π² )

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Right, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, multiplied by the factor c.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, but wait, eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. So the imaginary part is zero. So A can't be correct.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because in our case the eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Because A is the angular momentum operator, when you square it, A² would have eigenvalues that are the same for all components. So for any eigenstate of Ay, it will also be an eigenstate of A², since A² commutes with all components. But will it also be an eigenstate of Az? No, because if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Az. So C seems correct. But let me think more.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, every linear operator's eigenvectors form a basis, assuming they are diagonalizable. Since S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian because c is real. So yes, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D seems correct. But let's see what the options say.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. Let's look at each option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, this is a bit vague. The basis functions of the operator are probably the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So if the operator is diagonalizable, which it is since it's Hermitian, then the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D could be correct.

But let me focus on the options. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

What about option C? For a spin-1/2 system, any component's eigenstates (like Ay) are eigenstates of A², because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az. So C's first part is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². But the second part says "but not of the Z-component, Az." Wait, that's not correct because it's possible for a state to be an eigenstate of two components at once. But in the case of spin-1/2, I think that if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az, because the operators don't commute. So C's statement is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For angular momentum, the eigenstates of one component (like Ay) are eigenstates of A² but not of another component (like Az), because they don't share eigenstates due to the commutator [Ay, Az] being non-zero. So a state can be eigenstate of Ay and A², but not of Az. So C's statement is correct.

So looking at the options, what are they:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, and has two eigenvalues, the eigenvectors would form a basis, so D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. The options are about statements made during the calculation.

Wait, the question is about which statement you would consider correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So which statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, any operator's eigenvectors (if they exist and form a basis) are the basis for the space. So D is correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, perhaps this is a bit ambiguous. The basis functions of the matrix operator—maybe the matrix is given in some basis, and the eigenfunctions might form a different basis. But in this case, since the operator is 2x2 and diagonalizable, the eigenvectors would form an orthonormal basis. So D seems correct.

But which of the options is correct?

Wait, perhaps it's better to eliminate the options. Let's go back.

Eigenvalue calculation: We found that the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, which ones match.

Option A: the eigenvalue's imaginary parts are ±2πh, which would be huge, but our eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. So their eigenvalues would be complex numbers, but our Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real. So B is wrong.

So only options C and D could be correct.

Now, the question is about the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. Let me think about each step.

When you calculate eigenfunctions of Ay, do you have to consider whether they are eigenfunctions of A² and Az?

Well, for the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you don't necessarily have to consider A² and Az. But the statements are about properties of the eigenfunctions.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says not of Az, which is correct because [Ay, Az] is non-zero, so their eigenstates can't be the same.

So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. The matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form another basis. So whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think D is correct as the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the domain of the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but which of the options is correct in the context of the calculation. The question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one could be correct, but looking at the answer options, probably only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So for the calculation, the correct statements are those which hold true.

So let's think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct. So that's a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the basis functions are the eigenvectors, so I think this is also correct.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is given in a certain basis. The matrix Ay is already given in the standard basis, so the eigenvectors are in that same basis. So perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, which is the same basis as the operator's matrix.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors are a basis for the space, regardless of the operator's original basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is C because during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, so I'm a bit torn between C and D.

Let me think again about the question. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

If during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct?

Option C is about properties of the eigenfunctions, which are correct. So during the calculation, you would recognize that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C is correct.

Option D is about the basis functions of the operator, which I think is correct, but perhaps the statement is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Ay has eigenvalues ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any option talking about complex eigenvalues is wrong.

Looking at options, A and B are wrong because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

So the correct options are C and D.

Now, considering each statement.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² (which they are), but not of Az. So correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions form the basis of the matrix operator. So yes, since they form a basis for the space, which is the same as the operator's domain.

But the question is which is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

But I'm not entirely certain. So perhaps it's better to reevaluate.

Wait, the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. So to diagonalize it, you find its eigenvectors, which form a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

Alternatively, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions because they are the vectors that form a basis when you diagonalize the operator. So D is correct.

But I'm not sure. So I think perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the actual eigenvectors.

Ay has eigenvalues a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

The eigenvectors can be found by solving (Ay - a I) v = 0.

For a = h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ -h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

Equation 1: (-h/(4π)) v1 - i h/(4π) v2 = 0 → (-v1) -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to ( -i, 1 ), meaning the eigenvector can be written as [ -i, 1 ]^T. We can normalize it if needed.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   h/(4π) ]

Equation 1: (h/(4π)) v1 - i h/(4π) v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (i, 1)^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Now, what about A²? A is spin operator, so A² = (h^2)(S·S) where S is the Pauli matrices scaled by 1/2. Wait, wait, no. The intrinsic angular momentum for spin-1/2 particles is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle is given by J = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

In this problem, Ay is given as c S, where c = h/(4π) and S is the Pauli Y matrix. So c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So A² = (ħ/2)^2 σ_y^2. But σ_y^2 is identity matrix, so A² = (ħ^2/4) I.

So, A² acts as a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue (ħ²/4). So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of C says that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since [Ay, Az] = iħ Aphi (not exactly, but they don't commute), their eigenfunctions are different. So a state cannot be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator Ay is expressed in a particular basis (the standard basis, since the matrix is given in terms of standard basis vectors). Its eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form another basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix. So D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Both C and D seem correct, which can't be the case as it's a multiple-choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think: The eigenfunctions of Ay are vectors in the same space as the operator's matrix, so they form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

But looking back at the problem statement, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, you'd first find that Ay has two real eigenvalues, ±h/(4π). So any options that suggest complex eigenvalues are wrong.

So between C and D, which is correct?

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's also correct.

Wait, but the question is about which is correct.

I think I need to make a choice. Let me reread the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A² is a Casimir operator, its eigenfunctions are the same as any component's eigenfunctions. But Az is another component, so they can't share eigenfunctions unless they commute, which they don't.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

I think this is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, but perhaps the wording is ambiguous. Since the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis, and the eigenvectors form another basis, the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but the matrix operator itself is already expressed in some basis. The eigenfunctions are expressed in the same basis, so they form the basis of the operator's space.

But I'm not entirely confident. So perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a fact that holds true, whereas D is more about the basis, which might be a detail.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one option is given.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options might not have both as correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with Ay.

So for each eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ A_phi, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

So C is correct.

As for D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, yes, because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for R², which is the vector space of the operator. So D is correct as well.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because during the calculation, you would realize that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So I'll go with option C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These are real numbers, so any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is incorrect.

2. **Option A:**  
   This option claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real, with no imaginary components.

3. **Option B:**  
   This option suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real and do not match the values given in this option.

4. **Option C:**  
   This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because:
   - \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components of \( \mathbf{A} \). Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenfunction of \( A_z \).

5. **Option D:**  
   This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the vector space, the phrasing of this option is ambiguous. The operator \( A_y \) is already expressed in the standard basis, and the eigenvectors form a different basis. Thus, this option is less precise and not as directly relevant to the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement during the calculation is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the properties of the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \).

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c times S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar to this. Oh yeah, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix. That makes sense.

So the operator Ay is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Let me write that out. Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Okay, eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue, and φ is the eigenfunction (eigenvector in matrix terms).

First, let's find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y. Let me compute the components:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] 

So the elements are:
Ay₁₁ = 0
Ay₁₂ = -i (h/(4π))
Ay₂₁ = i (h/(4π))
Ay₂₂ = 0

So the matrix Ay looks like:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

The characteristic equation is:

det( Ay - a I ) = 0
=> | (-a)   (-i h/(4π)) |
   | (i h/(4π))  (-a)   | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So expanding that:

a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1. So (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (h²/(4π)^2) * 1 ] = 0

So equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π² ) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π² )

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Right, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, multiplied by the factor c.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, but wait, eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. So the imaginary part is zero. So A can't be correct.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because in our case the eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Because A is the angular momentum operator, when you square it, A² would have eigenvalues that are the same for all components. So for any eigenstate of Ay, it will also be an eigenstate of A², since A² commutes with all components. But will it also be an eigenstate of Az?

But in the case of spin-1/2, I think that if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az, because the operators don't commute. So C's statement is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For angular momentum, the eigenstates of one component (like Ay) are eigenstates of A² but not of another component (like Az), because they don't share eigenstates due to the commutator [Ay, Az] being non-zero. So a state can be eigenstate of Ay and A², but not of Az. So C's statement is correct.

Eigenvalue calculation: We found that the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, which ones match.

Option A: the eigenvalue's imaginary parts are ±2πh, which would be huge, but our eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. So their eigenvalues would be complex numbers, but our Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real. So B is wrong.

So only options C and D could be correct.

Now, the question is about the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. Let me think about each step.

When you calculate eigenfunctions of Ay, do you have to consider whether they are eigenfunctions of A² and Az?

Well, for the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you don't necessarily have to consider A² and Az. But the statements are about properties of the eigenfunctions.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says not of Az, which is correct because [Ay, Az] is non-zero, so their eigenstates can't be the same.

So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. The matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form another basis. So whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think D is correct as the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the domain of the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but which of the options is correct in the context of the calculation. The question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one could be correct, but looking at the answer options, probably only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So for the calculation, the correct statements are those which hold true.

So let's think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct. So that's a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the basis functions are the eigenvectors, so I think this is also correct.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is given in a certain basis. The matrix Ay is already given in the standard basis, so the eigenvectors are in that same basis. So perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, which is the same basis as the operator's matrix.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors are a basis for the space, regardless of the operator's original basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is C because during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, so I'm a bit torn between C and D.

Let me think again about the question. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

If during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct?

Option C is about properties of the eigenfunctions, which are correct. So during the calculation, you would recognize that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C is correct.

Option D is about the basis functions of the operator, which I think is correct, but perhaps the statement is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Ay has eigenvalues ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any option talking about complex eigenvalues is wrong.

Looking at options, A and B are wrong because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

So the correct options are C and D.

Now, considering each statement.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² (which they are), but not of Az. So correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions form the basis of the matrix operator. So yes, since they form a basis for the space, which is the same as the operator's domain.

But the question is which is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

But I'm not entirely certain. So perhaps it's better to reevaluate.

Wait, the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. So to diagonalize it, you find its eigenvectors, which form a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

Alternatively, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions because they are the vectors that form a basis when you diagonalize the operator. So D is correct.

But I'm not sure. So I think perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the actual eigenvectors.

Ay has eigenvalues a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

The eigenvectors can be found by solving (Ay - a I) v = 0.

For a = h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ -h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

Equation 1: (-h/(4π)) v1 - i h/(4π) v2 = 0 → (-v1) -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to ( -i, 1 ), meaning the eigenvector can be written as [ -i, 1 ]^T. We can normalize it if needed.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   h/(4π) ]

Equation 1: (h/(4π)) v1 - i h/(4π) v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (i, 1)^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Now, what about A²? A is spin operator, so A² = (h^2)(S·S) where S is the Pauli matrices scaled by 1/2. Wait, wait, no. The intrinsic angular momentum for spin-1/2 particles is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle is given by J = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

In this problem, Ay is given as c S, where c = h/(4π) and S is the Pauli Y matrix. So c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So A² = (ħ/2)^2 σ_y^2. But σ_y^2 is identity matrix, so A² = (ħ^2/4) I.

So, A² acts as a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue (ħ²/4). So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of C says that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since [Ay, Az] = iħ Aphi (not exactly, but they don't commute), their eigenfunctions are different. So a state cannot be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator Ay is expressed in a particular basis (the standard basis, since the matrix is given in terms of standard basis vectors). Its eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form another basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix. So D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Both C and D seem correct, which can't be the case as it's a multiple-choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think: The eigenfunctions of Ay are vectors in the same space as the operator's matrix, so they form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

But looking back at the problem statement, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, you'd first find that Ay has two real eigenvalues, ±h/(4π). So any options that suggest complex eigenvalues are wrong.

So between C and D, which is correct?

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's also correct.

Wait, but the question is about which is correct.

I think I need to make a choice. Let me reread the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A² is a Casimir operator, its eigenfunctions are the same as any component's eigenfunctions. But Az is another component, so they can't share eigenfunctions unless they commute, which they don't.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

I think this is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, but perhaps the wording is ambiguous. Since the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis, and the eigenvectors form another basis, the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but the matrix operator itself is already expressed in some basis. The eigenfunctions are expressed in the same basis, so they form the basis of the operator's space.

But I'm not entirely confident. So perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a fact that holds true, whereas D is more about the basis, which might be a detail.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one option is given.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options might not have both as correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with Ay.

So for each eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ A_phi, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

So C is correct.

As for D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, yes, because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for R², which is the vector space of the operator. So D is correct as well.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because during the calculation, you would realize that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So I'll go with option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These are real numbers, so any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is incorrect.

2. **Option A:**  
   This option claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real, with no imaginary components.

3. **Option B:**  
   This option suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real and do not match the values given in this option.

4. **Option C:**  
   This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because:
   - \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components of \( \mathbf{A} \). Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenfunction of \( A_z \).

5. **Option D:**  
   This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the vector space, the phrasing of this option is ambiguous. The operator \( A_y \) is already expressed in the standard basis, and the eigenvectors form a different basis. Thus, this option is less precise and not as directly relevant to the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement during the calculation is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the properties of the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \).

**Answer: C**
