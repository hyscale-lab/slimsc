Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So if plx is inversely proportional to distance, then plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

Wait, the formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So yes, plx = 1/r. Because distance r is in parsecs.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/r, that would make N proportional to (1/(1/r))^5. Let me write that out: N ∝ (r)^5. Because 1/(1/r) is r, so (r)^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5. But the options are about how the number changes with distance. Oh, wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's the rate of change, like the derivative?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So in a given volume, the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, no, wait. No, because when you're looking at a region at a certain distance, the volume you're considering might play a role. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So for a given region, the number of stars is N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant.

Since plx = 1/r, substituting that into N gives N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance. So if r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are about the number changing per unit range of distance. Does that mean the derivative of N with respect to r? Because per unit distance, it's the rate of change.

Hmm, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase as r^4. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's asking about the density of stars as a function of distance. Or perhaps it's about how many stars are in a shell of thickness dr at a distance r. Wait, in astronomy, when you consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, that's the surface density times the volume. Hmm, surface density is stars per unit area, and volume is 4π r² dr. Or perhaps it's more about the number per unit volume.

Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let's think in terms of N as a function of r.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So N = k r^5, where k is a constant.

But wait, N is the number of stars in the region. If we are considering a region at a distance r, perhaps the number of stars that appear in that region depends on the density of stars and the volume. But in this case, the data given is N = k / plx^5. So perhaps N increases as r^5, so for each increase in distance, the number of stars increases by r^5.

But the question asks about how the number changes with distance, per unit distance. So maybe it's the derivative, dN/dr. So if N = k r^5, then dN/dr =5 k r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance.

But wait, the options don't have r^4 as the correct answer for the way N changes. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Wait, option C is r^4. So if the derivative is proportional to r^4, then the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. But the way the question is phrased, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", perhaps it's looking for the dependence of N on r, not the derivative.

Wait, but earlier I thought N is proportional to r^5, which would make option B correct. So why the confusion?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. Wait, no, the initial statement says N varies with plx as 1/plx^5, so N is a function of distance, not considering volume. Hmm, perhaps I should think about how many stars are in a certain volume. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps the region of the sky is a spherical shell at a distance r, so the number of stars in that shell would depend on the surface area (4π r²) and the density. If the number of stars N in a shell is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit volume (since volume is 4π r² dr) would be N/(4π r² dr) = (k r^5)/(4π r² dr) ) = k r^3/(4π dr). Hmm, that gives a dependence on r^3, but perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars observed in a region (which depends on the distance) is given by N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases rapidly.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit distance. So perhaps it's the change in N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4, which would be option C.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The initial statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N = k r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance. So the number of stars scales as r^5, so the correct answer would be option B.

But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, does that mean the change is per unit distance? So, like, if you go a bit further in distance (dr), how much does the number of stars change (dN). So that would be the derivative dN/dr.

In that case, since N = kr^5, dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4, which would be option C.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "the number of stars... varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So that's how N depends on plx. Then, with respect to distance, N depends on r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. So per unit distance, the change is r^5 per r, which is r^4. So the change (dN/dr) is r^4, so option C.

But perhaps the question is asking not about the derivative but the overall dependence. The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance". So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with r^5. So the correct answer would be option B.

But the options are a bit tricky. Let me reevaluate.

The question states: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. plx = 1/r. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number... change with distance (per unit range of distance)". So per unit distance, the change would be the derivative. So if N = kr^5, then dN/dr =5kr^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option would be C, ~r^4.

But now I'm confused. What does the question actually ask? It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe it's asking for the number of stars per unit distance. For example, in a thin shell of thickness dr at a distance r, the number of stars would be proportional to the surface area (4πr²) times the density (stars per unit volume). But if the density decreases with distance, perhaps we can model that.

But the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which becomes N ∝ r^5. So N is the total number of stars in the region. If the region is a volume, say a sphere of radius r, then the number of stars in that volume is N = kr^5.

But wait, in reality, the number of stars in a volume of radius r would depend on density. But perhaps in this problem, it's given in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the region is a thin shell at distance r, so the number of stars in that shell (per unit distance) is what's being considered. So the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πr²) times the number density. But in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ r^5.

Wait, maybe the observed number is the count in a certain area (like a magnitude or a square degree). So if you have a certain area on the sky, the number of stars you see would depend on the distance. For example, at a certain distance, the volume you're looking into increases, so more stars are present.

But in this case, the question is given that N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = kr^5.

So if you have two points at r and r+dr, the number of stars at r+dr would be N + dN = k(r+dr)^5. So the change in N is dN = 5k r^4 dr. So the change per unit distance (dr=1) is 5k r^4. So the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the number density. So the number of stars per unit volume would be N/(volume) = (kr^5)/( (4/3)π r^3 ) ) = (3k/(4π)) r^2. So the number density would be increasing as r^2, which would correspond to option D. But that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether it's the total number in a region or the number per unit volume. Hmm.

The original setup: "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So it's the number of stars (total in that region) that's proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5.

So the number of stars in a region increases with r^5. Therefore, the dependence on r is r^5, so option B.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit of distance. So perhaps it's looking for the derivative, which would be 5 r^4.

So if the question is asking, for a given r, how much does N change as r increases by a little, then the derivative is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Ah, maybe the problem is that the question is considering the number of stars per unit distance. So the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dr, which is 5k r^4. So that would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. Let's suppose that in a given area of the sky, the number of stars you observe (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/r, N = k r^5.

So for each increase in r, N increases by a factor of r^5. So if you move from r to r+dr, the number of stars increases by k (r+dr)^5 - kr^5 ≈ 5kr^4 dr. So per unit dr (dr=1), the change is about 5kr^4.

So the change in N per unit change in r is 5kr^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

So perhaps the question is asking about the number per unit distance, which is dN/dr. So the change in N per unit change in r would be proportional to r^4.

In that case, the correct answer is option C.

But I'm a bit torn. Because the initial data says the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is N = k r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5, which is option B.

But the wording about "per unit range of distance" suggests that it's about the rate of change, the derivative. So I think that the correct answer is option C, r^4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options again.

Options:
A) r^3
B) r^5
C) r^4
D) r^2

If the number of stars is proportional to r^5, then the correct answer would be B. But if the question is asking about the rate of change, which is dN/dr =5 r^4, then it's C.

But the way the question is phrased, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", I think it's asking about the derivative. So the rate at which the number of stars changes as you move a unit distance is r^4.

So the correct answer is C.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This phrasing suggests the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^4 \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the derivative is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this describes the total number of stars, not the rate of change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as there is no dependence on \( r^2 \) in this context.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars changes with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
