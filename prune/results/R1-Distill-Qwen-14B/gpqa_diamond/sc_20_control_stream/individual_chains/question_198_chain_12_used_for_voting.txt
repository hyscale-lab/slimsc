Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M, and the [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M. We're given stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16 for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait. So I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. Higher β means a more stable complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, the complexes probably form stepwise. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, then the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

But wait, how many complexes are there? The β values given are up to β4=16. So likely, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^3- ? Or maybe the charges are different. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structures, but I think each additional SCN- adds to the complex.

But the question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is the one used in the famous cobalt thiocyanate color change experiment. So that's the second complex, corresponding to β2=40.

Wait, no, maybe it's another. Alternatively, I might have to think about the possible complexes and their colors. But for this problem, the key is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So the plan is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex, and then sum the fractions for the desired species.

But wait, the problem states 'dithiocyanato' which implies two SCN- ligands. So that's the second complex, so the species is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

The approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) in various complexes in solution, considering the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

Since the total cobalt concentration is given, and SCN- is in excess, we can model the distribution using the stability constants.

To model this, I can use the method where each complex's concentration is determined by the stepwise formation constants.

The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their respective concentrations.

Let me denote the complexes as:

- Co^2+ (free ion)
- [CoSCN]^+ (first complex, 1 SCN)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (second complex, 2 SCNs)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- (third complex, 3 SCNs)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} (fourth complex, 4 SCNs)

But wait, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β represents the formation of the next complex.

Wait, the formation constants (β) are defined such that:

β_1 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β_2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/( [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] )

β_3 = [Co(SCN)_3^- ]/( [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-] )

β_4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]/( [Co(SCN)_3^- ][SCN^-] )

So each β is the stepwise formation constant for adding one more SCN-.

Given that, the overall formation constant for each complex can be calculated as the product of the β's up to that point.

For example, the formation constant K1 for [CoSCN]^+ is β1 =9.

The formation constant K2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, K3 for [Co(SCN)_3^- ] is 9*40*63 = let's see, 9*40 is 360, 360 *63 is 22680.

And K4 for [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] is 9*40*63*16. Let me calculate that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, so the overall K for each complex is β1, β1β2, β1β2β3, β1β2β3β4.

But the total concentration of Co is the sum of all forms: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-}.

But in solution, the [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M. So we can model the distribution.

But the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So to find its fraction, we need to calculate [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4}).

But how do we calculate each concentration?

We can set up expressions for each complex in terms of [Co^2+], and then use the total cobalt concentration to find the ratios.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then,

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 * [CoSCN^+] [SCN] = β1 β2 * (β1 x [SCN]) * [SCN] = β1^2 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to express each complex in terms of x.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write each complex's concentration as:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) = β1 β2 ... βn * x * [SCN]^n.

Wait, let's think about it:

The concentration of the first complex [CoSCN]^+ is given by:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * [Co^2+][SCN^-] = β1 x [SCN].

Similarly, the second complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is formed from the first complex plus another SCN:

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [CoSCN^+][SCN] = β2 (β1 x [SCN]) [SCN] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Wait, no. Wait, no, [CoSCN^+] is β1 x [SCN], and [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 * [CoSCN^+] [SCN] = β2 (β1 x [SCN]) [SCN] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Similarly, the third complex [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be β3 * [Co(SCN)_2] [SCN] = β3 * (β1 β2 x [SCN]^2) [SCN] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3.

And the fourth complex [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} would be β4 * [Co(SCN)_3] [SCN] = β4 * (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3) [SCN] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because each step adds another SCN, so perhaps each next complex is built upon the previous.

So the concentrations are:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [CoSCN^+] [SCN] = β2 β1 x [SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2] [SCN] = β3 β2 β1 x [SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3] [SCN] = β4 β3 β2 β1 x [SCN]^4

So each complex's concentration is (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) x [SCN]^n, where n is the number of SCN ligands.

Now, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all these:

x + β1 x [SCN] + β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

We can factor x from all terms:

x [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] = 1e-2.

We can solve for x:

x = 1e-2 / [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ].

Once we have x, we can compute each concentration, and then find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2].

But let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN] = 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term in the denominator.

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

Compute 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680.

22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 =22.68.

Term4=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Let's compute step by step.

9*40=360.

360*63=22680.

22680 *16= 362,880.

Then [SCN]^4= (0.1)^4=1e-4=0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001= 36.288.

So term5=36.288.

Now sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5+22.68=28.18

28.18+36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Thus, x= 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01. So 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, but that's [Co^2+], right? Because x is [Co^2+].

Wait, no, x is [Co^2+] because in the equation, x is the concentration of the free Co^2+ ions.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The equation is x times the sum equals 0.01. So x is [Co^2+], the free ion.

So now, to find the concentration of each complex.

Compute [CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN] =9 *0.0001551 *0.1.

Compute 9 * 0.0001551=0.0013959.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.00013959 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.0001551 *(0.1)^2.

Compute 9*40=360. 360 *0.0001551=0.055836.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.055836 *0.01=0.00055836 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 *0.0001551*(0.1)^3.

Compute 9*40=360, *63=22680.

22680 *0.0001551=3.528468.

Multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001: 3.528468 *0.001=0.003528468 M.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_3] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3.

Which is 9*40*63 * x * (0.1)^3.

Wait, x is 0.0001551.

So 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

Then 22680 * x= 22680 *0.0001551= approximately 22680 * 0.0001=2.268; 22680 * 0.0000551= approx 1.246. So total approx 3.514.

Then multiply by (0.1)^3 = 0.001: 3.514 *0.001=0.003514 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16 * x * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880.

362880 * x=362880 *0.0001551= approx 362880 *0.0001=36.288, 362880 *0.0000551= approx 19.94. So total approx 56.228.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001: 56.228 * 0.0001=0.0056228 M.

Wait, but wait, [Co(SCN)_4] is 362880 * x * (0.1)^4 = (9*40*63*16) *0.0001551 *0.0001.

Wait, 0.1^4 is 0.0001, so 0.0001 *0.0001551 is 1.551e-8.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute [Co(SCN)_2]:

β1=9, β2=40. So β1 β2= 360.

[Co(SCN)_2] = 360 * x * (0.1)^2.

x is 0.0001551.

So 360 * 0.0001551 = 0.055836.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.055836 *0.01=0.00055836.

Similarly, [CoSCN^+] =9 * x *0.1.

9 *0.0001551= 0.0013959. *0.1= 0.00013959.

[Co(SCN)_3] = 9*40*63 *x*(0.1)^3.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

22680 * x=22680 * 0.0001551 = 3.527 (approx).

Multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001: 3.527 *0.001=0.003527.

[Co(SCN)_4] =9 *40 *63 *16 * x * (0.1)^4.

9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880.

362880 * x=362880 *0.0001551= approx 56.227.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001: 56.227 *0.0001=0.0056227.

Now, let me compile all the concentrations:

[Co^2+] = x = 0.0001551 M.

[CoSCN^+] = 0.00013959 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] = 0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)_3] =0.003527 M.

[Co(SCN)_4] =0.0056227 M.

Wait, let me sum them up to see if they add up to 0.01.

0.0001551 + 0.00013959 = 0.00029469.

Add 0.00055836: 0.00085305.

Add 0.003527: 0.00438005.

Add 0.0056227: 0.01000275. Approximately 0.01, which matches c(Co)=0.01 M. So the calculations seem correct.

Now, the question is the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is 0.00055836 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.00055836 /0.01 = 0.055836, which is 5.5836%. Wait, but none of the options are around 5.5%. The options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I inverted β's. Let me recheck the β values.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest.

Wait, but in the denominator, the sum is 64.468. Wait, but when I calculated the denominator using [SCN]=0.1, it gave me 64.468. So x=0.01/64.468≈0.0001551.

Wait, but perhaps the denominator is actually the sum of terms where each term is the product up to βn, multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the denominator.

Let me re-calculate the denominator terms.

Each term is:

Term1:1.

Term2: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40 * (0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

9*40=360, 360 *63=22680. (0.1)^3=0.001. So 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880. (0.1)^4=0.0001. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Wait, you're right. So the terms are:

1, 0.9, 3.6, 22.68, 36.288.

Wait, sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. Yes, that's correct.

So denominator is 64.468, x=0.01/64.468≈0.0001551.

So [Co(SCN)_2]=0.00055836 M.

Hmm, but 0.00055836 is 5.5836e-4 M, which is 5.58% of 0.01 M. But the options don't have that. So that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the wrong complex. The question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But perhaps the color is different, and I'm supposed to pick another complex. Or maybe I made a miscalculation in the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2].

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate [Co(SCN)_2] more accurately.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

β1=9, β2=40 → 9*40=360.

x=0.0001551.

[SCN]^2=0.01.

So 360 *0.0001551= 0.055836.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.00055836 M. Yes, same as before.

So 0.00055836 /0.01 =0.055836 →5.5836%.

But the options are much higher. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the question is about the labile species, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for a different order. For example, perhaps β1 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-, but that would make no sense because β4 is given as 16. Hmm, but no, the βn usually refers to the nth step.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the β given are in the reverse order. Like β4 is the first step. Wait, but the question lists β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β values are not in the order of adding SCN- but in decreasing order. But β3 is the largest (63), followed by β2=40, β1=9, β4=16. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Because normally, the stability constants increase with the number of ligands until a certain point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to model the distribution is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, but perhaps I'm missing a term.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct way is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion, using the formation constants.

The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, for each species, the denominator is the same as our denominator term, which we calculated as64.468.

So the fraction f for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) /64.468.

Compute numerator: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

So f =3.6 /64.468≈0.05578 →5.578%.

Still about 5.5%, which isn't in the options. So something is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem defines the stability constants as for each complex, not stepwise.

Meaning, K1=β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^2+.

K2=β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, that's a different approach. Because if βn are the overall formation constants, not stepwise.

But the way the problem is stated, "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β corresponds to a different complex, but not stepwise.

Wait, if that's the case, then the approach is different. Let me think.

In this case, the formation constants are for each complex, not stepwise. So:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )=9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )=40.

β3= [Co(SCN)_3^- ]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )=63.

β4= [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )=16.

In this scenario, each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So the concentrations would be:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-].

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^- ]= β3 x [SCN^-]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^{3-}]= β4 x [SCN^-]^4.

And the total Co is x + β1 [SCN] x + β2 [SCN]^2 x + β3 [SCN]^3 x + β4 [SCN]^4 x = c(Co).

So the sum is x [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c(Co).

So plugging the numbers in:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term1:1.

Term2: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3: β2 [SCN]^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term4: β3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term5: β4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Thus, x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.00423 M.

Now, compute each complex's concentration.

[CoSCN^+]=β1 x [SCN]=9 *0.00423 *0.1=9 *0.000423=0.003807 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]=β2 x [SCN]^2=40 *0.00423 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.00423 *0.01=40 *0.0000423=0.001692 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]=β3 x [SCN]^3=63 *0.00423 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.00423 *0.001=63 *0.00000423≈0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]=β4 x [SCN]^4=16 *0.00423 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.00423 *0.0001=16 *0.000000423 ≈0.000006768 M.

Now, the concentration of each species:

[Co^2+]=x=0.00423 M.

[CoSCN^+]=0.003807 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]=0.001692 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]=0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]=0.000006768 M.

Now, check the sum:

0.00423 + 0.003807 = 0.008037.

+0.001692 = 0.009729.

+0.000266 =0.009995.

+0.000006768≈0.010001768≈0.01 M. Correct.

Now, the question is the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is 0.001692 M.

Percentage = (0.001692 /0.01)*100 =16.92%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Approach:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   The stability constants (\( \beta \)) represent the overall formation constants for the complexes:
   - \( \beta_1 = [\text{CoSCN}^+]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]) \),
   - \( \beta_2 = [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2) \),
   - \( \beta_3 = [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3) \),
   - \( \beta_4 = [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{3-}]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4) \).

2. **Concentration of Free Cobalt Ion**:
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{3-}].
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for each complex in terms of \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):
   \[
   c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1[\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2[\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3[\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4[\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right).
   \]
   Solving for \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{1 + \beta_1[\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2[\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3[\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4[\text{SCN}^-]^4}.
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \),
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \),
   - \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \).

   Compute each term in the denominator:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Term 1:} & \, 1, \\
   \text{Term 2:} & \, \beta_1[\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
   \text{Term 3:} & \, \beta_2[\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
   \text{Term 4:} & \, \beta_3[\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
   \text{Term 5:} & \, \beta_4[\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
   \end{align*}
   \]
   Summing these terms:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Concentrations of Complexes**:
   Using \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \), the concentrations of the complexes are:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   [\text{CoSCN}^+] &= \beta_1[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.00423 \cdot 0.1 = 0.003807 \, \text{M}, \\
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] &= \beta_2[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.00423 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.001692 \, \text{M}, \\
   [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] &= \beta_3[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.00423 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.000266 \, \text{M}, \\
   [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{3-}] &= \beta_4[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.00423 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.000006768 \, \text{M}.
   \end{align*}
   \]

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:
   The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.001692}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.92\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**.
