Okay, so I've got this problem about electron scattering and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes involve something called partial waves and phase shifts. Let me try to recall the details.

The question gives phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄, each in degrees. The values are 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. I'm supposed to ignore the rest, so only these five are considered. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if the energy comes into play here directly.

Wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I think the scattering amplitude is calculated using the partial wave expansion. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over l of (something with the phase shifts).

The general formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ ( (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) ) / ( sin( (l - m) * π ) ) ) ] * ( (sinθ)^m ) / ( (1 + cosθ)^ (something) ) ) 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^infty ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (k r) ) * [ (sinθ/2)^{l+1} / ( (1 + cosθ) )^{l} ) ]

Wait, no, not quite. Another approach: The amplitude f is given by f = (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, maybe the P_l are Legendre polynomials. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps for each partial wave, the amplitude contributes a term, and when you sum them all, you get f(θ).

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ would be 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam is the direction you're measuring along, so the scattering angle θ is zero. So θ=0°, so cosθ = 1. Let's think about that.

So, for each l, the term in the sum would involve (2l+1) times e^{iδ_l} times sinδ_l times something else. But when θ is 0, what happens?

I think the P_l(cosθ) terms come into play. For θ=0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) equals 1. So that simplifies things.

So the formula for f(θ) along the beam direction (θ=0) becomes:

f(0) = (1/(k r)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * P_l(1) )

But since P_l(1) is 1, this simplifies to:

f(0) = (1/(k r)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the (1/(k r)) factor. Alternatively, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, no, perhaps f is (1/(2ik)) times that sum? Or maybe (1/(2ik)) multiplied by each term? Let me think.

Wait, another source I remember: The scattering amplitude is given by

f = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ) / (k) )

Wait, but I think the correct expression is:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps f is (1/(k)) times the sum. Let me make sure.

Another way to think: The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0). The optical theorem says that:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here, unless I can find the total cross-section. But the problem doesn't give any cross-section, so maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by something.

Wait, considering that the amplitude is a sum over partial waves, and each contributes a term. The imaginary part would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (2ik) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, no, maybe it's:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Because from the partial wave expansion, each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l times some factor. Let me think about units. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, say), because cross-section is area (fm²), and cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by (4π)/(k²), or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the amplitude f is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty sum_{m=-l}^l ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (i^l) ) * ( (Y_{l}^m (θ, φ))^* )

But in the question, we're considering the direction along the incident beam, which is θ=0 and φ=0. So, Y_{l}^m (0, 0) is sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * P_l(1) * e^{-i m φ} }, but for φ=0, it's just sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) P_l(1). Again, P_l(1) is 1, so Y_{lm} (0,0) = sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * δ_{m,0}.

So, the amplitude f(0,0) would be the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * (i^l) * ( sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) )) * ... wait, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps f(0) is simply the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik).

Wait, another approach: The general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (sin θ/2)^{l+1} / ( (1 + cos θ)^l ) ) )

But when θ=0, sinθ/2 is 0, so (sinθ/2)^{l+1} is zero for all l except l=-1, which isn't possible. Wait, that can't be right. That would imply f(0)=0, which doesn't make sense because the forward direction should have significant scattering.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the formula I'm recalling is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty [ (2l + 1) (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ) / (k) ] * [ (sin(θ/2))^{l+1} / ( (1 + cosθ) )^l ) ]

Wait, but when θ=0, sin(θ/2)=0, so all terms except l=0 would be zero. Because for l=0, the exponent is 1, so (sin(0/2))^1=0, so l=0 term is zero. Wait, that can't be right either. So I must be getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the partial wave expansion has a term that doesn't vanish at θ=0. Maybe the formula is different.

Another thought: The amplitude for each partial wave l is:

f_l(theta, phi) = ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l ) / (k) * [ (sin(theta/2))^{l} (1 + cos theta)^{l} ) ]

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me look up the correct formula—oh wait, I can't look things up now, I have to rely on memory.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the amplitude at the forward direction (θ=0) is sum_{l=0}^\infty  (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} / (2ik)

Because when θ=0, the angular part for each partial wave is 1, so the sum becomes:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, but 2ik would be in the denominator, so 1/(2ik) times the sum. But since the question is about the imaginary part, perhaps I can compute that.

So, the imaginary part of f(0) would be Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

Let me compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So when multiplied by (2l+1), the term becomes (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Then, when multiplied by 1/(2ik), each term becomes [ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * 1/(2ik).

Let me split this into real and imaginary parts.

The real part is [ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] * 1/(2ik ), which is real times 1/(2ik ), so it contributes to the imaginary part because 1/k is real, but 1/i is -i.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

So for each l, the contribution to the imaginary part is:

Im [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik) ) ]

Which is (2l+1) sin δ_l Im [ e^{i δ_l} / (2ik) ]

Im [ e^{i δ_l} ] is sin δ_l, and 1/(2ik) can be written as (-i)/(2k).

So, (2l+1) sin δ_l * [ (-i sin δ_l) / (2ik) ]

Wait, perhaps let's compute each step.

The term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Expressed as:

(2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin δ_l
= (2l+1)( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l )

Then, when you multiply by 1/(2ik), the term becomes:

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] * 1/(2ik )

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) ) + i sin² δ_l / (2ik) ]

Now, let's compute the imaginary part of this term. The imaginary part comes from the imaginary component of the sum.

Looking at each part:

The first term: cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) → real number divided by (2ik). 1/k is real, so this term is real divided by i, which is imaginary. So its imaginary part is:

cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2k) * (-i) → but wait, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. Let me think again.

Wait, 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/(2)) * (1/k).

So each term becomes:

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i)/(2k) ) + i sin² δ_l * (-i)/(2k) ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me factor out 1/(2k):

= (2l+1) * [ (cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i) ) + (i sin² δ_l * (-i) ) ) ] / (2k)

Wait, let me compute each part inside:

First part: cos δ sin δ * (-i)
Second part: i sin² δ * (-i) = (-i^2) sin² δ = sin² δ (since i^2 = -1)

So,

= (2l+1) [ (-i cos δ sin δ ) + sin² δ ] / (2k)

So the term is:

(2l+1) [ sin² δ - i cos δ sin δ ] / (2k )

The imaginary part of this term is the coefficient of i multiplied by -1, since the term is [ a + i b ] → imaginary part is b.

Wait, no, the term has [ sin² δ + (-i cos δ sin δ) ]

So the imaginary part is (- cos δ sin δ) * (2l+1) / (2k )

But wait, wait. Let me re-express this:

The entire term is [ a + b i ]

Where a = (2l+1) sin² δ / (2k ), and b = (2l+1)(- cos δ sin δ ) / (2k )

So the imaginary part is b, which is (2l+1) (- cos δ sin δ ) / (2k )

But wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the entire f(0), so the sum of all these b terms.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because when you expand e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, the imaginary part is sin δ_l * sin δ_l = sin² δ_l. So perhaps I'm missing a step here.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to take the real and imaginary parts of each term.

Each term in the sum for f(0) is:

(2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik)

So, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

Multiply by sin δ_l:

sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

Then multiply by (2l+1)/(2ik):

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] / (2ik )

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) ) + i sin² δ_l / (2ik) ]

= (2l+1) [ ( cos δ_l sin δ_l ) / (2ik) ) + ( sin² δ_l )/(2k) ) * (i/i) * (1/i) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of each term.

The term is:

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] / (2ik )

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) ) + i sin² δ_l / (2ik) ]

The real part is the first term, and the imaginary part is the second term.

The imaginary part of the term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2ik ) * i.

Because the second term is [ i sin² δ_l ] * 1/(2ik ) = [ i sin² δ_l ]/(2ik) = [ sin² δ_l ]/(2k) * (i/(i)) )= sin² δ_l/(2k) * 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't quite compute. Let me do the math step by step.

The second part is [ i sin² δ_l ] / (2ik ) = [ i sin² δ_l ] * [1/(2ik)] = [ i sin² δ_l ] * [ 1/(2i k) ) ] = sin² δ_l * [ i/(2i k) ) ] = sin² δ_l * (1/(2k) )

Because i/(2i) = 1/2.

So the imaginary part of the term is [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, because the second term is real now. Wait, no, because the first term is real, the second term is real. But wait, that can't be right because the term was supposed to have an imaginary component. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you sum all terms, the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k) multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute Im f(0) as (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because when you expand e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, the imaginary part is sin^2 δ_l, and when multiplied by 1/(2ik), the i in the denominator would contribute a factor of -i, but considering that, perhaps the total imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l/(2k).

Wait, let me think again. The term per l is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l = (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So when you sum all terms, each multiplied by 1/(2ik), the imaginary part of the entire sum would be sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k).

Wait, because 1/(2ik) has a factor of i in the denominator, which when multiplied by the imaginary part (which has a factor of i) would give a real value.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (1/(2k)).

Because, for each term:

Im [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik) ) ] = (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

So the total Im f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but why 2l+1 times sin² δ_l divided by 2k? Let me think.

Wait, the term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Then, when multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is (1/2i) * (1/k), the imaginary part would be (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (1/(2k)) * (-i) * i ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part as follows:

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )/(2ik )

The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) * Im [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2ik )

But e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So Im [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] = sin^2 δ_l.

Thus, each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2ik )

But wait, 1/(2ik) is equal to (1/(2i)) (1/k) = (-i/2) (1/k )

So:

(2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2ik ) = (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-i)/(2k )

Wait, but the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. Let me compute:

The term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-i) / (2k )

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-1) / (2k )

Wait, but that would be negative. But the options are all positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, let's think about the units. The amplitude f has units of length. The given options are in fm. So k is in units of 1/length.

The electrons are 50 MeV. I need to compute k, the wave number.

The energy E is given as 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50 MeV.

The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/(ħ c), but perhaps more accurately, using relativistic formulas.

But wait, for non-relativistic cases, k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but since 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, it's relativistic.

Wait, the relativistic relation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c

Then, k = p / (ħ).

Wait, let's compute this.

E =50 MeV,

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, E^2 = (50)^2 (MeV)^2,

(m c^2)^2 = (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - ~0.26) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p c ≈50 MeV.

Then p = 50 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (50 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) * (1/c )^{-1} ?

Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, units: ħ has units of J s, but when using MeV and fm, it's often expressed as ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm )

So, k = p / (ħ) = (p c) / (ħ c) ) * (1/c)

Wait, but perhaps:

p c = 50 MeV,

So k = (50 MeV) / (ħ c) ) * (1/c )^{-1} ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing units. Alternatively, since p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c,

So p = [sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ] / c

But (50)^2 is 2500, so sqrt(2500 - 0.26) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c ) / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm,

So 1/(ħ c) ) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm) ) → (1 MeV^{-1} fm^{-1}).

Wait, so:

k = (50 MeV/c) * (1/(ħ c)) )

= 50 MeV / (ħ c) ) * (1 / c )^{-1} ??

Hmm, perhaps easier to compute numerically.

k = p / ħ.

p c =50 MeV,

so p =50 MeV / c.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So p =50 MeV / c → p = (50) / (197.33) * (ħ c / c^2) )

Wait, perhaps another approach.

k = p / ħ = (p c) / (ħ c )

= (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute more carefully.

E =50 MeV,

m c² =0.511 MeV,

So E² = (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2,

m² c^4 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So (E² - m² c^4 ) =2499.739 (MeV)^2.

sqrt(E² - m² c^4 ) = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV.

So p c ≈49.9974 MeV.

Thus, p = (49.9974 MeV) / c.

Now, ħ c ≈197.327 MeV fm.

So, p = (49.9974 MeV) / c → p/(ħ) = (49.9974 MeV) / (c * ħ ) ).

Since ħ c =197.327 MeV fm,

c * ħ = 197.327 MeV fm.

So p/(ħ) = (49.9974 MeV) / (197.327 MeV fm )

= 49.9974 / 197.327 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 10^2 fm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the formula for f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But I think that the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Because each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

So the total Im f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but let me compute each term.

The phase shifts given are:

δ₀ =90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

So for each l, (2l+1) and sin² δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0:

2*0+1=1.

sin(90°)=1, so sin²=1.

Term: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:

2*1+1=3.

sin(67)=approx 0.9205, so sin²≈0.847.

Term: 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2:

2*2+1=5.

sin(55)=0.8192, sin²≈0.671.

Term:5 * 0.671≈3.355.

l=3:

2*3+1=7.

sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25.

Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:

2*4+1=9.

sin(13)=0.22495, sin²≈0.05058.

Term:9 *0.05058≈0.455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.541 =3.541

+3.355 →6.896

+1.75 →8.646

+0.455 →9.101.

So sum ≈9.101.

Then, Im f(0) = sum / (2k ) → 9.101 / (2 *0.2533 ) → 9.101/(0.5066) ≈ 17.95.

Wait, but in units of 1/k. Wait, k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is in fm.

So Im f(0 ) ≈17.95 fm.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger than my current estimate. What did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Because I think the correct formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but wait, no, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Summing the terms:

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * (sin 67°)^2 ≈3*(0.847)=2.541.

l=2:5*(sin55°)^2≈5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.05058)=0.455.

Sum:1 +2.541=3.541 +3.355=6.896 +1.75=8.646 +0.455=9.101.

So sum is 9.101.

Then, Im f(0 ) = sum/(2k ) → 9.101/(2*0.2533 )≈9.101/(0.5066 )≈17.95 fm.

But none of the options match this. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, 17.95 is not close to any of these. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

E=50 MeV,

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

E² = (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2.

m^2 c^4= (0.511)^2≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So, E² - m^2 c^4=2500 -0.261≈2499.739 (MeV)^2.

p c= sqrt(2499.739 )=≈49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV /c.

Now, ħ c=197.327 MeV fm.

So, k = p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c ) / (197.327 MeV fm ) * c.

Wait, because ħ has units of MeV fm /c.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units more carefully.

The wavevector k is given by:

k = p / ħ.

p = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^½ / c.

In units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

So,

k = ( sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c ) / ( ħ )

= sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / ( c * ħ )

But since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

c * ħ =197.33 MeV fm.

Thus,

k = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= (49.9974 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm )

=49.9974 /197.33 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but in the calculation of Im f(0 ), I have Im f(0 ) = sum/(2k ) → sum is 9.101, 2k is 0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So 9.101 /0.5066 ≈17.95 fm.

But the options are much higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Did I forget that the amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum, but the imaginary part is sum/(2k )?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign, but the options are all positive. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l )/(k ), not divided by 2k.

Wait, because when I calculated each term's imaginary part, I had:

Im [ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / (2ik) ) ] = (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

So sum over l gives sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

So previous calculation of ~17.95 fm.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin² δ_l.

Wait, let's recalculate with sin δ_l.

For each l:

l=0: 1 * sin 90°=1 → 1.

l=1:3 * sin67=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.0245=13.382.

Then, Im f(0) = sum/(2k )

=13.382/(2 *0.2533 ) → 13.382/0.5066 ≈26.41 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k )

In that case, using the same sum of 13.382.

13.382 / 0.2533 ≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 177.675 fm. That's about ten times 17.95. So perhaps I forgot a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the sum should include an additional factor of something else. Let me think about the scattering amplitude again.

The formula for the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / (k) * [ (sin θ/2)^{l+1} / ( (1 + cos θ)^l ) ]

At θ=0, sin θ/2 =0, but (1 + cos theta )=2. So the term becomes:

sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l /k ] * (0^{l+1} ) / (2^l )

But this gives zero for all l except l=-1, which is not possible. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the forward scattering amplitude is:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Which would make the imaginary part:

Im f(0) = (1/2k ) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Which brings us back to our initial calculation of ~17.95 fm.

But none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let's redo the calculation of k.

E=50 MeV,

m c²=0.511 MeV,

So,

E² =50^2=2500 (MeV)^2,

m² c^4=0.511^2=0.261 (MeV)^2,

E² - m²c^4=2500 -0.261=2499.739,

sqrt(2499.739 )=49.9974 MeV.

p c=49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV /c.

Now, ħ c=197.327 MeV fm,

so k = p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/(197.327 MeV fm ) * c.

Wait, the units: (MeV/c ) divided by (MeV fm ) → (1/c ) * (1/(fm )) → (1/(fm c )) ?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The wavevector k has units of 1/length.

In natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, k = p.

But to get k in fm^{-1}, we can use:

k = p / ħ → p is in MeV/c,

so p =49.9974 MeV/c,

ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm,

so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

Thus,

k = (49.9974 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV fm )/c ) )

= (49.9974 ) / (197.33 ) * (MeV/c ) * ( c )/( MeV fm )

= 49.9974 / 197.33 * 1/(fm )

≈0.2533 fm^{-1}

Thus, 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

So Im f(0 )= sum/(2k )=9.101/(2 *0.2533 )=9.101/0.5066≈17.95 fm.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, for each l:

l=0:1 *90 → no, wait, sin δ_l is sin 90=1.

Wait, the sum would be (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So:

l=0:1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *sin30=3.5.

l=4:9* sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Then, Im f(0 )= sum/(k )=13.382 /0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675.

Which is about 17.7 *10. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are in degrees and should be converted to radians.

Ah! I think that's it. Because in quantum mechanics, phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. So I must have used degrees for sin, but calculations require radians.

So let me re-calculate the sum, converting all angles to radians.

Compute sin(δ_l ) in radians.

Compute each sin^2 δ_l in radians.

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 radians. sin(π/2)=1 → sin^2=1.

l=1:67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937 )≈0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473.

l=2:55 degrees →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993 )≈0.8192 → sin²≈0.6710.

l=3:30 degrees= π/6 radians≈0.5236 rad.

sin=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

l=4:13 degrees=13*π/180≈0.22689 radians.

sin(0.22689 )≈0.2253 → sin²≈0.0507.

Now, compute (2l+1) * sin² δ_l.

l=0:1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.0507≈0.4563.

Sum:

1 +2.5419 =3.5419,

+3.355=6.8969,

+1.75=8.6469,

+0.4563=9.1032.

So sum≈9.1032.

Im f(0 )= sum/(2k )=9.1032/(2 *0.2533 )=9.1032/0.5066≈17.95 fm.

Same result as before. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the formula for the amplitude is:

f(0) = [ sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2ik )

Then, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

Which gives 17.95 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin (2 δ_l )

Because in some contexts, the imaginary part may involve sin(2θ) terms.

Wait, let's compute that.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

l=0: 1 * sin(180° )=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134° )=3*sin(134)=3*0.6691≈2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110 )=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60 )=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26 )=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:0 +2.0073=2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Im f(0 )= sum/(2k )=16.7134/(2*0.2533 )=16.7134/0.5066≈32.98 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Alternative idea: Maybe the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the square.

As before, that gives sum=13.382, leading to Im f(0 )=13.382/(2k )=13.382/0.5066≈26.41 fm.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Then Im f(0 )= sum/(k )=13.382 /0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Not matching.

Hmm. Now I'm stuck. The calculations don't match any of the given options. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the scattering amplitude is in the direction of the incident beam, which could involve a factor of (1/(k r)), but in the options, the answers are in the order of hundreds, which suggests that perhaps r is involved.

Wait, the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So perhaps the amplitude is given by (something) times (1/(k r)).

Wait, but in the given options, the units are in fm, which suggests that it's a length, so (1/k) would have units of fm, since k is in fm^{-1}.

So, if the formula is Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

Which gives ~17.95 fm.

But the options have C as 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

E=50 MeV,

m c²=0.511 MeV.

E² = (50)^2 =2500,

m² c^4= (0.511)^2≈0.261.

p c= sqrt(2500 -0.261 )= ~49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm.

k= p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/( (197.327 MeV fm ) /c )

= (49.9974 )/(197.327 ) * (MeV/c ) * c/(MeV fm )

= (49.9974 /197.327 ) * 1/fm → 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

So, Im f(0 )=9.1032/(2 *0.2533 )=17.95 fm.

Hmm. So without a matching option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the correct formula for Im f(0) is (1/(k )) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Which would give sum=13.382,

Im f(0 )=13.382 / 0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another thought: The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So we're only considering l=0 to l=4.

But perhaps the formula for f(0) is (1/k ) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Which gives 52.83 fm.

But option C is 177.675, which is about 3.36 times this.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

E=50 MeV,

m= electron mass= 0.511 MeV/c².

Using relativistic energy:

E²= (p c )² + (m c² )² → p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4 )

= sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

Thus, p=50 MeV/c.

Now, k = p/(ħ )

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm,

so ħ =197.33 MeV fm / c.

Thus, k = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm /c )

= (50 /197.33 ) * (1/(fm )) → ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Thus, back to Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )=9.1032/(2*0.2533 )=17.95 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2pi, but that would give 112 fm, which is close to option B (355) but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l without division by 2k.

Which would give 13.382/(0.2533 )≈52.83 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * e^{i δ_l }, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of f(0 ) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So sum is 13.382,

so Im f(0 )=13.382/(k )=13.382/0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * 2.

So sum would be 26.764,

Im f(0 )=26.764/(0.2533 )≈105.65 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 17.95 fm, but this isn't one of the options. However, option C is 177.675, which is exactly 10 times 17.7675. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting MeV to the right units. Let me check.

Wait, when I compute k, I used E=50 MeV, but perhaps the correct formula uses the reduced mass or something else.

Wait, but the problem states it's a scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I think the nucleus is much heavier, so the reduced mass μ ≈m_e.

But let's compute μ.

μ= (m_e * M )/(m_e + M ), where M is the nuclear mass.

Assuming M is very large, μ≈m_e.

So no significant change.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im f(0 ) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382,

so Im f(0 )=13.382/(k )=52.83 fm.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * 2.

Which would give 26.764,

Im f(0 )=26.764/(0.2533 )=105.65 fm.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 1e3 somewhere, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k is wrong.

Wait, let me recompute k using E=50 MeV.

E =50 MeV,

m c²=0.511 MeV,

so E²=2500,

m² c^4=0.261,

so p c= sqrt(2500 -0.261 )=49.9974 MeV,

so p=49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm,

so k= p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/(197.327 MeV fm/c ) ) → (49.9974 /197.327 ) * (MeV/c ) / (MeV fm/c ) )

= (49.9974 /197.327 ) * (1/fm )

= 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm. Given that none of the options match my calculations, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382.

Then, Im f(0 )= 13.382/(k )=52.83 fm.

Close to option C (177.675 ) but not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the sum of (2l+1) * sin δ_l and multiplied by (1/(k)).

But 52.83 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Another approach: Let me look up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

After checking, I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) sin δ_l )

At θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1.

Thus, f(0 )= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of f(0 ) is:

Im f(0 )= (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Which is what I calculated earlier.

So, assuming this is correct, the answer should be approximately 17.95 fm, which isn't an option.

So I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, which is 10 times my calculation. But why?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the wave number k is in units of fm^{-1}, but perhaps the correct unit conversion results in k being much smaller.

Wait, let me re-calculate k in more precise terms.

E=50 MeV,

m=0.511 MeV/c²,

so,

E²=50^2=2500 (MeV)^2,

m² c^4=0.511^2=0.261 (MeV)^2.

Thus,

p c= sqrt(2500 -0.261 )=49.9974 MeV,

p=49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm,

so,

k= p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/(197.327 MeV fm ) * c

= 49.9974 / 197.327 * 1/fm → 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.95 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k ).

Which gives sum=13.382,

Im f(0 )=13.382/(0.2533 )=52.83 fm.

But still no match.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) multiplied by (1/(k )) * (4π/(k )) ), but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the total cross-section, but without knowing the cross-section, that's not helpful.

Given that I can't find a match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 177.675 fm, which is 17.95 *10, but I can't see where the factor of 10 comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13.

Wait, perhaps the l=0 term is not included. Let me see. The first term l=0 has δ_0=90°, so sin² is 1. If I exclude l=0, the sum would be:

l=1:3*0.8473≈2.5419,

l=2:5*0.671≈3.355,

l=3:7*0.25=1.75,

l=4:9*0.0507≈0.4563.

Sum≈2.5419+3.355=5.8969+1.75=7.6469+0.4563=8.1032.

Im f(0 )=8.1032/(2k )=8.1032/(0.5066 )≈15.97 fm.

Still not matching.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach, but I can't figure it out. Given the options and the initial calculation, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude. The formula for the scattering amplitude at forward scattering (θ = 0) is:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l
\]

The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is determined using the relativistic energy relation:
\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]
where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( mc^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \). Solving for \( pc \):
\[
pc = \sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \sqrt{2500 - 0.261} \approx 49.9974 \, \text{MeV}
\]
Thus:
\[
p = \frac{49.9974}{c}
\]
Using \( \hbar c = 197.327 \, \text{MeV fm} \), the wave number \( k \) is:
\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{49.9974}{197.327} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is:
\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]
The phase shifts are given as:
\[
\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \, \delta_4 = 13^\circ
\]
Converting these to radians and computing \( \sin^2\delta_l \):
- \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_0 = 1 \)
- \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_1 \approx 0.847 \)
- \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_2 \approx 0.671 \)
- \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_3 = 0.25 \)
- \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_4 \approx 0.0507 \)

Now compute the weighted sum:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = (1)(1) + (3)(0.847) + (5)(0.671) + (7)(0.25) + (9)(0.0507)
\]
\[
= 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4563 \approx 9.1032
\]
Substitute into the formula for \( \text{Im } f(0) \):
\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{9.1032}{2k} = \frac{9.1032}{2(0.2533)} \approx 17.95 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 17.95 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the given options. However, option \( \text{C} \) (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \)) is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or interpretation of the problem.

Given the available options and the closest match, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about electron scattering and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes involve something called partial waves and phase shifts. Let me try to recall the details.

The question gives phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄, each in degrees. The values are 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. I'm supposed to ignore the rest, so only these five are considered. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if the energy comes into play here directly.

Wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I think the scattering amplitude is calculated using the partial wave expansion. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over l of (something with the phase shifts).

The general formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ ( (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) ) / ( sin( (l - m) * π ) ) ) ] * ( (sinθ)^m ) / ( (1 + cosθ)^ (something) ) ) 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^infty ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (k r) ) * [ (sinθ/2)^{l+1} / ( (1 + cosθ) )^{l} ) ]

Wait, no, not quite. Another approach: The amplitude f is given by f = (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, maybe the P_l are Legendre polynomials. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps for each partial wave, the amplitude contributes a term, and when you sum them all, you get f(θ).

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ would be 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam is the direction you're measuring along, so the scattering angle θ is zero. So θ=0°, so cosθ = 1. Let's think about that.

So, for each l, the term in the sum would involve (2l+1) times e^{iδ_l} times sinδ_l times something else. But when θ is 0, what happens?

I think the P_l(cosθ) terms come into play. For θ=0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) equals 1. So that simplifies things.

So the formula for f(θ) along the beam direction (θ=0) becomes:

f(0) = (1/(k r)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * P_l(1) )

But since P_l(1) is 1, this simplifies to:

f(0) = (1/(k r)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the (1/(k r)) factor. Alternatively, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, no, perhaps f is (1/(2ik)) times that sum? Or maybe (1/(2ik)) multiplied by each term? Let me think.

Wait, another source I remember: The scattering amplitude is given by

f = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ) / (k) )

Wait, but I think the correct expression is:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps f is (1/(k)) times the sum. Let me make sure.

Another way to think: The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0). The optical theorem says that:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here, unless I can find the total cross-section. But the problem doesn't give any cross-section, so maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by something.

Wait, considering that the amplitude is a sum over partial waves, and each contributes a term. The imaginary part would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (2ik) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, no, maybe it's:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Because from the partial wave expansion, each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l times some factor. Let me think about units. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, say), because cross-section is area (fm²), and cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by (4π)/(k²), or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the amplitude f is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty sum_{m=-l}^l ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (i^l) ) * ( (Y_{l}^m (θ, φ))^* )

But in the question, we're considering the direction along the incident beam, which is θ=0 and φ=0. So, Y_{l}^m (0, 0) is sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * P_l(1) * e^{-i m φ} }, but for φ=0, it's just sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) P_l(1). Again, P_l(1) is 1, so Y_{lm} (0,0) = sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * δ_{m,0}.

So, the amplitude f(0,0) would be the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * (i^l) * ( sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) )) * ... wait, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps f(0) is simply the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik).

Wait, another approach: The general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (sin θ/2)^{l+1} / ( (1 + cos θ)^l ) ) )

But when θ=0, sinθ/2 is 0, so (sinθ/2)^{l+1} is zero for all l except l=-1, which isn't possible. Wait, that can't be right. That would imply f(0)=0, which doesn't make sense because the forward direction should have significant scattering.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the formula I'm recalling is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty [ (2l + 1) (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ) / (k) ] * [ (sin(θ/2))^{l+1} / ( (1 + cosθ) )^l ) ]

Wait, but when θ=0, sin(θ/2)=0, so all terms except l=0 would be zero. Because for l=0, the exponent is 1, so (sin(0/2))^1=0, so l=0 term is zero. Wait, that can't be right either. So I must be getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the partial wave expansion has a term that doesn't vanish at θ=0. Maybe the formula is different.

Another thought: The amplitude for each partial wave l is:

f_l(theta, phi) = ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l ) / (k) * [ (sin(theta/2))^{l} (1 + cos theta)^{l} ) ]

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me look up the correct formula—oh wait, I can't look things up now, I have to rely on memory.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the amplitude at the forward direction (θ=0) is sum_{l=0}^\infty  (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} / (2ik)

Because when θ=0, the angular part for each partial wave is 1, so the sum becomes:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Wait, but 2ik would be in the denominator, so 1/(2ik) times the sum. But since the question is about the imaginary part, perhaps I can compute that.

So, the imaginary part of f(0) would be Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

Let me compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So when multiplied by (2l+1), the term becomes (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Then, when multiplied by 1/(2ik), each term becomes [ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * 1/(2ik).

Let me split this into real and imaginary parts.

The real part is [ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l ] * 1/(2ik ), which is real times 1/(2ik ), so it contributes to the imaginary part because 1/k is real, but 1/i is -i.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

So for each l, the contribution to the imaginary part is:

Im [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik) ) ]

Which is (2l+1) sin δ_l Im [ e^{i δ_l} / (2ik) ]

Im [ e^{i δ_l} ] is sin δ_l, and 1/(2ik) can be written as (-i)/(2k).

So, (2l+1) sin δ_l * [ (-i sin δ_l) / (2ik) ]

Wait, perhaps let's compute each step.

The term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Expressed as:

(2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin δ_l
= (2l+1)( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l )

Then, when you multiply by 1/(2ik), the term becomes:

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] * 1/(2ik )

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) ) + i sin² δ_l / (2ik) ]

Now, let's compute the imaginary part of this term. The imaginary part comes from the imaginary component of the sum.

Looking at each part:

The first term: cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) → real number divided by (2ik). 1/k is real, so this term is real divided by i, which is imaginary. So its imaginary part is:

cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2k) * (-i) → but wait, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. Let me think again.

Wait, 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/(2)) * (1/k).

So each term becomes:

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i)/(2k) ) + i sin² δ_l * (-i)/(2k) ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me factor out 1/(2k):

= (2l+1) * [ (cos δ_l sin δ_l * (-i) ) + (i sin² δ_l * (-i) ) ) ] / (2k)

Wait, let me compute each part inside:

First part: cos δ sin δ * (-i)
Second part: i sin² δ * (-i) = (-i^2) sin² δ = sin² δ (since i^2 = -1)

So,

= (2l+1) [ (-i cos δ sin δ ) + sin² δ ] / (2k)

So the term is:

(2l+1) [ sin² δ - i cos δ sin δ ] / (2k )

The imaginary part of this term is the coefficient of i multiplied by -1, since the term is [ a + i b ] → imaginary part is b.

Wait, no, the term has [ sin² δ + (-i cos δ sin δ) ]

So the imaginary part is (- cos δ sin δ) * (2l+1) / (2k )

But wait, wait. Let me re-express this:

The entire term is [ a + b i ]

Where a = (2l+1) sin² δ / (2k ), and b = (2l+1)(- cos δ sin δ ) / (2k )

So the imaginary part is b, which is (2l+1) (- cos δ sin δ ) / (2k )

But wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the entire f(0), so the sum of all these b terms.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because when you expand e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, the imaginary part is sin δ_l * sin δ_l = sin² δ_l. So perhaps I'm missing a step here.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to take the real and imaginary parts of each term.

Each term in the sum for f(0) is:

(2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik)

So, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

Multiply by sin δ_l:

sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

Then multiply by (2l+1)/(2ik):

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] / (2ik )

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) ) + i sin² δ_l / (2ik) ]

= (2l+1) [ ( cos δ_l sin δ_l ) / (2ik) ) + ( sin² δ_l )/(2k) ) * (i/i) * (1/i) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of each term.

The term is:

(2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] / (2ik )

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) ) + i sin² δ_l / (2ik) ]

The real part is the first term, and the imaginary part is the second term.

The imaginary part of the term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2ik ) * i.

Because the second term is [ i sin² δ_l ] * 1/(2ik ) = [ i sin² δ_l ]/(2ik) = [ sin² δ_l ]/(2k) * (i/(i)) )= sin² δ_l/(2k) * 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't quite compute. Let me do the math step by step.

The second part is [ i sin² δ_l ] / (2ik ) = [ i sin² δ_l ] * [1/(2ik)] = [ i sin² δ_l ] * [ 1/(2i k) ) ] = sin² δ_l * [ i/(2i k) ) ] = sin² δ_l * (1/(2k) )

Because i/(2i) = 1/2.

So the imaginary part of the term is [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k )

Wait, because the second term is real now. Wait, no, because the first term is real, the second term is real. But wait, that can't be right because the term was supposed to have an imaginary component. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you sum all terms, the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k) multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute Im f(0) as (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because when you expand e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, the imaginary part is sin^2 δ_l, and when multiplied by 1/(2ik), the i in the denominator would contribute a factor of -i, but considering that, perhaps the total imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l/(2k).

Wait, let me think again. The term per l is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l = (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So when you sum all terms, each multiplied by 1/(2ik), the imaginary part of the entire sum would be sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k).

Wait, because 1/(2ik) has a factor of i in the denominator, which when multiplied by the imaginary part (which has a factor of i) would give a real value.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (1/(2k)).

Because, for each term:

Im [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2ik) ) ] = (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

So the total Im f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but why 2l+1 times sin² δ_l divided by 2k? Let me think.

Wait, the term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Then, when multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is (1/2i) * (1/k), the imaginary part would be (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (1/(2k)) * (-i) * i ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part as follows:

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )/(2ik )

The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) * Im [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2ik )

But e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So Im [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] = sin^2 δ_l.

Thus, each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2ik )

But wait, 1/(2ik) is equal to (1/(2i)) (1/k) = (-i/2) (1/k )

So:

(2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2ik ) = (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-i)/(2k )

Wait, but the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. Let me compute:

The term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-i) / (2k )

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l * (-1) / (2k )

Wait, but that would be negative. But the options are all positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, let's think about the units. The amplitude f has units of length. The given options are in fm. So k is in units of 1/length.

The electrons are 50 MeV. I need to compute k, the wave number.

The energy E is given as 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50 MeV.

The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/(ħ c), but perhaps more accurately, using relativistic formulas.

But wait, for non-relativistic cases, k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but since 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, it's relativistic.

Wait, the relativistic relation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c

Then, k = p / (ħ).

Wait, let's compute this.

E =50 MeV,

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, E^2 = (50)^2 (MeV)^2,

(m c^2)^2 = (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - ~0.26) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p c ≈50 MeV.

Then p = 50 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (50 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) * (1/c )^{-1} ?

Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, units: ħ has units of J s, but when using MeV and fm, it's often expressed as ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm )

So, k = p / (ħ) = (p c) / (ħ c) ) * (1/c)

Wait, but perhaps:

p c = 50 MeV,

So k = (50 MeV) / (ħ c) ) * (1/c )^{-1} ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing units. Alternatively, since p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c,

So p = [sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ] / c

But (50)^2 is 2500, so sqrt(2500 - 0.26) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c ) / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm,

So 1/(ħ c) ) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm) ) → (1 MeV^{-1} fm^{-1}).

Wait, so:

k = (50 MeV/c) * (1/(ħ c)) )

= 50 MeV / (ħ c) ) * (1 / c )^{-1} ??

Hmm, perhaps easier to compute numerically.

k = p / ħ.

p c =50 MeV,

so p =50 MeV / c.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So p =50 MeV / c → p = (50) / (197.33) * (ħ c / c^2) )

Wait, perhaps another approach.

k = p / ħ = (p c) / (ħ c )

= (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute more carefully.

E =50 MeV,

m c² =0.511 MeV,

So E² = (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2,

m² c^4 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So (E² - m² c^4 ) =2499.739 (MeV)^2.

sqrt(E² - m² c^4 ) = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV.

So p c ≈49.9974 MeV.

Thus, p = (49.9974 MeV) / c.

Now, ħ c ≈197.327 MeV fm.

So, p = (49.9974 MeV) / c → p/(ħ) = (49.9974 MeV) / (c * ħ ) ).

Since ħ c =197.327 MeV fm,

c * ħ = 197.327 MeV fm.

So p/(ħ) = (49.9974 MeV) / (197.327 MeV fm )

= 49.9974 / 197.327 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 10^2 fm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the formula for f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But I think that the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Because each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

So the total Im f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but let me compute each term.

The phase shifts given are:

δ₀ =90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

So for each l, (2l+1) and sin² δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0:

2*0+1=1.

sin(90°)=1, so sin²=1.

Term: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:

2*1+1=3.

sin(67)=approx 0.9205, so sin²≈0.847.

Term: 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2:

2*2+1=5.

sin(55)=0.8192, sin²≈0.671.

Term:5 * 0.671≈3.355.

l=3:

2*3+1=7.

sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25.

Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:

2*4+1=9.

sin(13)=0.22495, sin²≈0.05058.

Term:9 *0.05058≈0.455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.541 =3.541

+3.355 →6.896

+1.75 →8.646

+0.455 →9.101.

So sum ≈9.101.

Then, Im f(0) = sum / (2k ) → 9.101 / (2 *0.2533 ) → 9.101/(0.5066) ≈ 17.95.

Wait, but in units of 1/k. Wait, k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is in fm.

So Im f(0 ) ≈17.95 fm.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger than my current estimate. What did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Because I think the correct formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but wait, no, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Summing the terms:

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * (sin 67°)^2 ≈3*(0.847)=2.541.

l=2:5*(sin55°)^2≈5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.05058)=0.455.

Sum:1 +2.541=3.541 +3.355=6.896 +1.75=8.646 +0.455=9.101.

So sum is 9.101.

Then, Im f(0 ) = sum/(2k ) → 9.101/(2*0.2533 )≈9.101/(0.5066 )≈17.95 fm.

But none of the options match this. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, 17.95 is not close to any of these. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

E=50 MeV,

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

E² = (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2.

m^2 c^4= (0.511)^2≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So, E² - m^2 c^4=2500 -0.261≈2499.739 (MeV)^2.

p c= sqrt(2499.739 )=≈49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV /c.

Now, ħ c=197.327 MeV fm.

So, k = p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c ) / (197.327 MeV fm ) * c.

Wait, because ħ has units of MeV fm /c.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units more carefully.

The wavevector k is given by:

k = p / ħ.

p = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^½ / c.

In units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

So,

k = ( sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c ) / ( ħ )

= sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / ( c * ħ )

But since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

c * ħ =197.33 MeV fm.

Thus,

k = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= (49.9974 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm )

=49.9974 /197.33 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but in the calculation of Im f(0 ), I have Im f(0 ) = sum/(2k ) → sum is 9.101, 2k is 0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So 9.101 /0.5066 ≈17.95 fm.

But the options are much higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Did I forget that the amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum, but the imaginary part is sum/(2k )?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign, but the options are all positive. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l )/(k ), not divided by 2k.

Wait, because when I calculated each term's imaginary part, I had:

Im [ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / (2ik) ) ] = (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

So sum over l gives sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )

So previous calculation of ~17.95 fm.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin² δ_l.

Wait, let's recalculate with sin δ_l.

For each l:

l=0: 1 * sin 90°=1 → 1.

l=1:3 * sin67=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.0245=13.382.

Then, Im f(0) = sum/(2k )

=13.382/(2 *0.2533 ) → 13.382/0.5066 ≈26.41 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k )

In that case, using the same sum of 13.382.

13.382 / 0.2533 ≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 177.675 fm. That's about ten times 17.95. So perhaps I forgot a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the sum should include an additional factor of something else. Let me think about the scattering amplitude again.

The formula for the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / (k) * [ (sin θ/2)^{l+1} / ( (1 + cos θ)^l ) ]

At θ=0, sin θ/2 =0, but (1 + cos theta )=2. So the term becomes:

sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l /k ] * (0^{l+1} ) / (2^l )

But this gives zero for all l except l=-1, which is not possible. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the forward scattering amplitude is:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

Which would make the imaginary part:

Im f(0) = (1/2k ) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Which brings us back to our initial calculation of ~17.95 fm.

But none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let's redo the calculation of k.

E=50 MeV,

m c²=0.511 MeV,

So,

E² =50^2=2500 (MeV)^2,

m² c^4=0.511^2=0.261 (MeV)^2,

E² - m²c^4=2500 -0.261=2499.739,

sqrt(2499.739 )=49.9974 MeV.

p c=49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV /c.

Now, ħ c=197.327 MeV fm,

so k = p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/(197.327 MeV fm ) * c.

Wait, the units: (MeV/c ) divided by (MeV fm ) → (1/c ) * (1/(fm )) → (1/(fm c )) ?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The wavevector k has units of 1/length.

In natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, k = p.

But to get k in fm^{-1}, we can use:

k = p / ħ → p is in MeV/c,

so p =49.9974 MeV/c,

ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm,

so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

Thus,

k = (49.9974 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV fm )/c ) )

= (49.9974 ) / (197.33 ) * (MeV/c ) * ( c )/( MeV fm )

= 49.9974 / 197.33 * 1/(fm )

≈0.2533 fm^{-1}

Thus, 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

So Im f(0 )= sum/(2k )=9.101/(2 *0.2533 )=9.101/0.5066≈17.95 fm.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, for each l:

l=0:1 *90 → no, wait, sin δ_l is sin 90=1.

Wait, the sum would be (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So:

l=0:1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *sin30=3.5.

l=4:9* sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Then, Im f(0 )= sum/(k )=13.382 /0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675.

Which is about 17.7 *10. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are in degrees and should be converted to radians.

Ah! I think that's it. Because in quantum mechanics, phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. So I must have used degrees for sin, but calculations require radians.

So let me re-calculate the sum, converting all angles to radians.

Compute sin(δ_l ) in radians.

Compute each sin^2 δ_l in radians.

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 radians. sin(π/2)=1 → sin^2=1.

l=1:67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937 )≈0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473.

l=2:55 degrees →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993 )≈0.8192 → sin²≈0.6710.

l=3:30 degrees= π/6 radians≈0.5236 rad.

sin=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

l=4:13 degrees=13*π/180≈0.22689 radians.

sin(0.22689 )≈0.2253 → sin²≈0.0507.

Now, compute (2l+1) * sin² δ_l.

l=0:1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.0507≈0.4563.

Sum:

1 +2.5419 =3.5419,

+3.355=6.8969,

+1.75=8.6469,

+0.4563=9.1032.

So sum≈9.1032.

Im f(0 )= sum/(2k )=9.1032/(2 *0.2533 )=9.1032/0.5066≈17.95 fm.

Same result as before. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the formula for the amplitude is:

f(0) = [ sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2ik )

Then, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

Which gives 17.95 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin (2 δ_l )

Because in some contexts, the imaginary part may involve sin(2θ) terms.

Wait, let's compute that.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

l=0: 1 * sin(180° )=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134° )=3*sin(134)=3*0.6691≈2.0073.

l=2:5*sin(110 )=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60 )=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26 )=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:0 +2.0073=2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Im f(0 )= sum/(2k )=16.7134/(2*0.2533 )=16.7134/0.5066≈32.98 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Alternative idea: Maybe the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the square.

As before, that gives sum=13.382, leading to Im f(0 )=13.382/(2k )=13.382/0.5066≈26.41 fm.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Then Im f(0 )= sum/(k )=13.382 /0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Not matching.

Hmm. Now I'm stuck. The calculations don't match any of the given options. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the scattering amplitude is in the direction of the incident beam, which could involve a factor of (1/(k r)), but in the options, the answers are in the order of hundreds, which suggests that perhaps r is involved.

Wait, the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So perhaps the amplitude is given by (something) times (1/(k r)).

Wait, but in the given options, the units are in fm, which suggests that it's a length, so (1/k) would have units of fm, since k is in fm^{-1}.

So, if the formula is Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / (2k )

Which gives ~17.95 fm.

But the options have C as 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

E=50 MeV,

m c²=0.511 MeV.

E² = (50)^2 =2500,

m² c^4= (0.511)^2≈0.261.

p c= sqrt(2500 -0.261 )= ~49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm.

k= p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/( (197.327 MeV fm ) /c )

= (49.9974 )/(197.327 ) * (MeV/c ) * c/(MeV fm )

= (49.9974 /197.327 ) * 1/fm → 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

So, Im f(0 )=9.1032/(2 *0.2533 )=17.95 fm.

Hmm. So without a matching option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the correct formula for Im f(0) is (1/(k )) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Which would give sum=13.382,

Im f(0 )=13.382 / 0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another thought: The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So we're only considering l=0 to l=4.

But perhaps the formula for f(0) is (1/k ) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Which gives 52.83 fm.

But option C is 177.675, which is about 3.36 times this.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

E=50 MeV,

m= electron mass= 0.511 MeV/c².

Using relativistic energy:

E²= (p c )² + (m c² )² → p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4 )

= sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

Thus, p=50 MeV/c.

Now, k = p/(ħ )

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm,

so ħ =197.33 MeV fm / c.

Thus, k = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm /c )

= (50 /197.33 ) * (1/(fm )) → ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Thus, back to Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l / (2k )=9.1032/(2*0.2533 )=17.95 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2pi, but that would give 112 fm, which is close to option B (355) but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l without division by 2k.

Which would give 13.382/(0.2533 )≈52.83 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * e^{i δ_l }, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of f(0 ) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So sum is 13.382,

so Im f(0 )=13.382/(k )=13.382/0.2533≈52.83 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * 2.

So sum would be 26.764,

Im f(0 )=26.764/(0.2533 )≈105.65 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 17.95 fm, but this isn't one of the options. However, option C is 177.675, which is exactly 10 times 17.7675. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting MeV to the right units. Let me check.

Wait, when I compute k, I used E=50 MeV, but perhaps the correct formula uses the reduced mass or something else.

Wait, but the problem states it's a scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I think the nucleus is much heavier, so the reduced mass μ ≈m_e.

But let's compute μ.

μ= (m_e * M )/(m_e + M ), where M is the nuclear mass.

Assuming M is very large, μ≈m_e.

So no significant change.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im f(0 ) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382,

so Im f(0 )=13.382/(k )=52.83 fm.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * 2.

Which would give 26.764,

Im f(0 )=26.764/(0.2533 )=105.65 fm.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 1e3 somewhere, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k is wrong.

Wait, let me recompute k using E=50 MeV.

E =50 MeV,

m c²=0.511 MeV,

so E²=2500,

m² c^4=0.261,

so p c= sqrt(2500 -0.261 )=49.9974 MeV,

so p=49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm,

so k= p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/(197.327 MeV fm/c ) ) → (49.9974 /197.327 ) * (MeV/c ) / (MeV fm/c ) )

= (49.9974 /197.327 ) * (1/fm )

= 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm. Given that none of the options match my calculations, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382.

Then, Im f(0 )= 13.382/(k )=52.83 fm.

Close to option C (177.675 ) but not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the sum of (2l+1) * sin δ_l and multiplied by (1/(k)).

But 52.83 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Another approach: Let me look up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

After checking, I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) sin δ_l )

At θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1.

Thus, f(0 )= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of f(0 ) is:

Im f(0 )= (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Which is what I calculated earlier.

So, assuming this is correct, the answer should be approximately 17.95 fm, which isn't an option.

So I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, which is 10 times my calculation. But why?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the wave number k is in units of fm^{-1}, but perhaps the correct unit conversion results in k being much smaller.

Wait, let me re-calculate k in more precise terms.

E=50 MeV,

m=0.511 MeV/c²,

so,

E²=50^2=2500 (MeV)^2,

m² c^4=0.511^2=0.261 (MeV)^2.

Thus,

p c= sqrt(2500 -0.261 )=49.9974 MeV,

p=49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm,

so,

k= p/(ħ )= (49.9974 MeV/c )/(197.327 MeV fm ) * c

= 49.9974 / 197.327 * 1/fm → 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.95 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0 )= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k ).

Which gives sum=13.382,

Im f(0 )=13.382/(0.2533 )=52.83 fm.

But still no match.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) multiplied by (1/(k )) * (4π/(k )) ), but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the total cross-section, but without knowing the cross-section, that's not helpful.

Given that I can't find a match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 177.675 fm, which is 17.95 *10, but I can't see where the factor of 10 comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13.

Wait, perhaps the l=0 term is not included. Let me see. The first term l=0 has δ_0=90°, so sin² is 1. If I exclude l=0, the sum would be:

l=1:3*0.8473≈2.5419,

l=2:5*0.671≈3.355,

l=3:7*0.25=1.75,

l=4:9*0.0507≈0.4563.

Sum≈2.5419+3.355=5.8969+1.75=7.6469+0.4563=8.1032.

Im f(0 )=8.1032/(2k )=8.1032/(0.5066 )≈15.97 fm.

Still not matching.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach, but I can't figure it out. Given the options and the initial calculation, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I'm not confident.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude. The formula for the scattering amplitude at forward scattering (θ = 0) is:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l
\]

The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is determined using the relativistic energy relation:
\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]
where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( mc^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \). Solving for \( pc \):
\[
pc = \sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \sqrt{2500 - 0.261} \approx 49.9974 \, \text{MeV}
\]
Thus:
\[
p = \frac{49.9974}{c}
\]
Using \( \hbar c = 197.327 \, \text{MeV fm} \), the wave number \( k \) is:
\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{49.9974}{197.327} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is:
\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l
\]
The phase shifts are given as:
\[
\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \, \delta_4 = 13^\circ
\]
Converting these to radians and computing \( \sin^2\delta_l \):
- \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_0 = 1 \)
- \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_1 \approx 0.847 \)
- \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_2 \approx 0.671 \)
- \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_3 = 0.25 \)
- \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \): \( \sin^2\delta_4 \approx 0.0507 \)

Now compute the weighted sum:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = (1)(1) + (3)(0.847) + (5)(0.671) + (7)(0.25) + (9)(0.0507)
\]
\[
= 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4563 \approx 9.1032
\]
Substitute into the formula for \( \text{Im } f(0) \):
\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{9.1032}{2k} = \frac{9.1032}{2(0.2533)} \approx 17.95 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 17.95 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the given options. However, option \( \text{C} \) (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \)) is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or interpretation of the problem.

Given the available options and the closest match, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
