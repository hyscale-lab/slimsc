Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The choices are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible operators compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model.

So first, what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model has the gauge symmetry which is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but the question is about broader symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations. Since the Standard Model is a Lorentz invariant theory, SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. That means all operators must be built in a way that they transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So point 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. Wait, but in effective field theories, we usually work in a framework where the theory is Poincare invariant. However, in SMEFT, the interactions are written as a low-energy expansion, and the theory is valid below the cutoff scale. So in the SMEFT Lagrangian, all terms must be Poincare invariant. Because if not, then the theory would have non-invariant terms which aren't physical. So point 2, Poincare symmetry, must also be respected. So options including both 1 and 2 are possible.

Wait, but wait a second. Sometimes people talk about theories that have explicit breaking of certain symmetries. But SMEFT is built to respect the Standard Model symmetries, but I think Poincare is more about the structure of spacetime. So I think all SMEFT operators must be Poincare invariant. So 2 is correct as well.

So 1 and 2 must be respected. That would eliminate options that don't include both. Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2 → yes.

Option C) 1,2,4 → yes.

But wait, what about the others: CP and CPT symmetry.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model is almost CP symmetric, except for certain parts, like the CKM matrix in quark mixing leading to CP violation. So in the Standard Model, the symmetry isn't exact. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't require CP symmetry for its operators. So operators can violate CP, meaning CP isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected. So point 3 is not required. So any option including 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry is a big one. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially when dealing with unitarity and causality. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, so SMEFT, being an effective theory of the Standard Model, must also respect CPT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So point 4 is correct.

So putting it together. The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. Which options include all three?

Looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4 → includes all three.

Option A) only 1,2.

So the correct answer would be option C, because it includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. So if all operators must be Poincare invariant, then they must also be Lorentz invariant. So 1 and 2 are linked. But as per the question, it's which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

But in the SMEFT, you can have operators that have higher dimensions but must be Lorentz scalars. So all operators must be Poincare invariant. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but some sources say that the SMEFT respects Poincare but not necessarily CP. So the correct symmetries to respect are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not CP (3).

So the correct answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible operators compatible with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and SMEFT, being an effective theory, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This means all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since SMEFT is formulated as a Poincaré-invariant effective field theory, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry (2) must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not exactly CP-symmetric due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is not required to enforce CP symmetry, operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and as an effective theory, SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry. Hence, CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is:
