Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is a formyl group), and a cyano group. These three are meta to each other. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl groups are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group).

Hmm, that's a bit to unpack. Let me draw a benzene ring to visualize this. The ring has six positions, numbered 1 through 6. I'll consider the carboxylic acid as the first point of reference, perhaps at position 1.

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, right? So the numbering should start such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the other substituents are numbered relative to that.

So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. The substituents meta to each other are the carboxylic acid, the formyl group, and the cyano group. So if the carboxylic acid is at 1, the formyl and cyano are at 3 and 5, perhaps? Because in a benzene ring, meta positions are two apart. So 1,3,5 would be meta to each other. Wait, no. Wait, meta positions are two carbons apart. So for a benzene ring, each substituent is two positions away from another in the meta arrangement.

Wait, let me think. If I have substituents A, B, and C all in the meta positions relative to each other, their positions would be such that each is separated by two carbons. So for a benzene ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 would each be two positions apart from each other. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the formyl could be at 3, and the cyano at 5. Or any permutation of that.

But wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is meta to the other two. So the three groups are at positions 1,3,5.

Now, ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So ortho positions to 1 are 2 and 6. So at positions 2 and 6, we have -OH and -N(CH3)2. Wait, but which is which? That's something I'll need to figure out based on other information.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is position 4. So position 4 has OMe.

Additionally, the methoxy group (position 4) and the hydroxyl group (either position 2 or 6) are both ortho to the nitrile group. The nitrile is at position 5 (from earlier), but wait, let's see.

Wait, the methoxy is at position 4, and the hydroxyl is either 2 or 6. Let's say the hydroxyl is at 2. Then, the nitrile group is at position 5. So for position 5 (cyano), its ortho positions are 4 and 6. So if the methoxy is at 4 and the hydroxyl is at 2, the hydroxyl isn't ortho to the cyano. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to reorient my thinking. Let me re-examine the substituents.

Let me number the ring as follows:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
2: ?
3: CHO (carbaldehyde)
4: OMe (methoxy)
5: CN (cyano)
6: ?

Wait, the carboxylic acid is at 1. The formyl is at 3, meta to 1. The cyano is at 5, which is meta to both 1 and 3. So positions 1,3,5 have COOH, CHO, CN.

Ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6 are hydroxyl and dimethyl amino.

Para to COOH is position 4; that's OMe.

So, positions 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2. Let's figure out which is which.

Now, the methoxy group (position 4) and the hydroxyl (say, position 2) are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5). Wait, nitrile is at 5. Positions ortho to 5 are 4 and 6. So if the methoxy is at 4, then it's ortho to 5. The hydroxyl is at 2, which is not ortho to 5. Hmm, that's an issue. Because the question states that both the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile.

So in that arrangement, the hydroxyl is at 2 and the nitrile is at 5. For the hydroxyl to be ortho to the nitrile (5), it needs to be at position 4 or 6. But position 4 is OMe, so the hydroxyl can't be there. Therefore, perhaps the hydroxyl is at 6.

Wait, let me try this again. Let's say COOH is at 1, CHO at 3, CN at 5. Then positions ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2.

Also, the methoxy is at 4 (para to COOH). Now, the question says that the methoxy (position 4) and the alcohol (let's say at 6) are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5).

Wait, position 5's ortho positions are 4 and 6. So if the nitrile is at 5, the substituents at 4 and 6 are ortho to it. The methoxy is at 4, and the hydroxyl is at 6. So yes, both are ortho to the nitrile. That makes sense.

So, substituents:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
3: CHO
4: OMe
5: CN
6: OH

Wait, that's the arrangement.

So, let me list the substituents in order of priority. The functional groups are:

Carboxylic acid (COOH) - highest priority.

Then, we have the substituents:

At position 2: dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
Position 3: formyl (CHO)
Position 4: methoxy (OMe)
Position 5: cyano (CN)
Position 6: hydroxyl (OH)

Wait, but wait, the priority order for substituents in IUPAC naming is based on alphabetical order, but the numbering is based on the substituents to get the lowest possible numbers. Oh, but the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts from there.

Wait, no. The numbering starts from the substituent that gives the lowest numbers to the other substituents, considering the principal functional group. Wait, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid as position 1. So we don't need to change that.

Now, the substituents are:

Position 2: dimethylamino
Position 3: formyl
Position 4: methoxy
Position 5: cyano
Position 6: hydroxyl

Wait, but I thought the substituents at 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2. So in this arrangement, position 2 is N(CH3)2 and 6 is OH.

Wait, no: I thought that the substituents ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6. So 2 and 6 have N(CH3)2 and OH. But according to the other condition, the methoxy (4) and the OH (6) are ortho to the CN (5). That works because 5's ortho are 4 and 6.

So, substituents:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2
3: CHO
4: OMe
5: CN
6: OH

Now, the IUPAC name would be based on this numbering.

The substituents are:

At position 2: (dimethylamino)
Position 3: formyl
Position 4: methoxy
Position 5: cyano
Position 6: hydroxyl

Wait, but wait, in IUPAC naming, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but the positions are determined by the numbering starting at the principal group and giving the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

But wait, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to the principal functional group. So after the principal group (COOH at 1), the other substituents are numbered from 2 to 6 in order.

But, the substituents are:

2: dimethylamino
3: formyl
4: methoxy
5: cyano
6: hydroxyl

So, the name would be benzoic acid with substituents in the order of their positions. So the substituents are numbered in the order of their positions around the ring, starting from the principal group.

Wait, but when writing the substituents, the order is alphabetical, but the positions are in the order they appear around the ring.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given as their numbers in the order around the ring.

But wait, the actual order of substituents in the name is based on their priority, not necessarily their positions. Let me think again. IUPAC rules say that substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. So, the substituent that comes first alphabetically is listed first.

So, the substituents here are: CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

CN is first in the alphabetical order: C comes before D, F, H, M.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but let me list them:

- cyano (CN)
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
- formyl (CHO)
- hydroxyl (OH)
- methoxy (OCH3)

So alphabetical order is CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

But wait, "dimethylamino" starts with D, so after C. So first is CN, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

Wait, but the question is about the correct IUPAC name. So the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given based on their numbering.

Wait, but the numbering is fixed based on the principal group. The substituents are numbered 2,3,4,5,6, and their substituents are at those positions.

So the name would be:

benzoic acid with substituents at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), and 6 (hydroxyl).

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up some positions. Let's recount. From the earlier analysis, the substituents are:

1: COOH (position 1)
2: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
3: CHO (formyl)
4: OMe (methoxy)
5: CN (cyano)
6: OH (hydroxyl)

So the substituents are at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxyl).

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are written in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the order would be:

CN comes first (as cyano), then dimethylamino (as it starts with D), then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

But wait, no: 'hydroxyl' starts with H, which comes after D, F, and M.

Wait, no. Let's list all substituents:

- cyano (CN): C
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2): D
- formyl (CHO): F
- hydroxyl (OH): H
- methoxy (OCH3): M

So alphabetical order is C, D, F, H, M.

So the substituents in the name would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Each with their respective positions. Let's write them in order.

So the name would start with benzoic acid, then the substituents in order:

1. 3-cyano
2. 6-(dimethylamino)
3. 5-formyl
4. 2-hydroxy
5. 4-methoxy

Wait, wait, let's see. No, because the substituent at position 3 is formyl.

Wait no, the substituents are at position 3: formyl.

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The substituents are:

Position 2: dimethylamino
Position 3: formyl
Position 4: methoxy
Position 5: cyano
Position 6: hydroxyl

So in the name, after benzoic acid, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each prefixed by their position number.

Wait, but the positions are in the order of their numbering around the ring. Wait, no, the positions are determined by their order around the ring when numbered starting from the principal group.

So, the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6. So when writing the name, each substituent is indicated by its position, but the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of their names.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order are:

1. cyano (position 5)
2. dimethylamino (position 2)
3. formyl (position 3)
4. hydroxyl (position 6)
5. methoxy (position 4)

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me list the substituents and their positions:

- cyano: position 5
- dimethylamino: position 2
- formyl: position 3
- hydroxyl: position 6
- methoxy: position 4

So the alphabetical order is:

1. cyano (5)
2. dimethylamino (2)
3. formyl (3)
4. hydroxyl (6)
5. methoxy (4)

So the name would be: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that matches.

Wait, let me check the options.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's the same as what I came up with.

Alternatively, let me check the other options.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That would imply substituents at 3 (CN), 6 (dimethylamino), 5 (CHO), 2 (OH), 4 (OMe). But in our structure, CN is at 5. So option A is not correct.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Hmm, substituents at 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OMe), 5 (CHO), 6 (NMe2). But in our structure, substituents at 2 is NMe2, 3 is CHO, 4 is OMe, 5 is CN, 6 is OH. So no, this option doesn't match.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents: 2 (NMe2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OMe),5 (CN),6 (OH). That's the same as our structure. Wait, so what's the difference between option D and option C?

Wait, option C is: 2-(dimethylamino)..., 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano,6-hydroxy.

Which would correspond to substituents at 2,3,4,5,6 as NMe2, CHO, OMe, CN, OH.

But wait, in our case, the substituents are:

2: NMe2
3: CHO
4: OMe
5: CN
6: OH

Which matches option D's substituents except for the order.

Wait, no. The options are written in a particular order. Let me read the options again.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So the substituent order is cyano (5), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4). So in the name, the substituents are in alphabetical order, which they are.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents here are:

2: dimethylamino
3: formyl
4: methoxy
5: cyano
6: hydroxy

Which is the same as in our structure. So this is option C.

Wait, but I thought option D also had the same substituents, but in a different order in the name.

Wait, no, no. The substituents are in the same order because the substituents are organized alphabetically regardless of their positions. So the correct name would have the substituents in alphabetical order, which is CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but in option C, the substituents are listed as:

2-(dimethylamino),3-formyl,4-methoxy,5-cyano,6-hydroxy.

Which is not in alphabetical order.

Wait, no. Because in the IUPAC name, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. So the order in the name would be CN first, then dimethylamino, etc.

So the correct name should have the substituents ordered as CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name would start with 5-cyano, then 2-(dimethylamino), etc.

Which is exactly what option D says.

So why is option C not correct? Because in option C, the substituents are listed in the order of their positions, which is not the correct alphabetical order.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Because I thought the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the correct name would have the substituents arranged alphabetically, each with their position number.

So, in the name, the substituents would be written as:

5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which is what option D says.

So the correct answer would be option D.

But wait, let me just double-check each substituent's position.

COOH is at 1.

Ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6 are NMe2 and OH. Since the substituents in option D are 2-(dimethylamino) and 6-hydroxy, that makes sense.

The methoxy is at 4 (para to COOH).

The formyl is at 3 (meta to COOH), and the cyano is at 5 (meta to COOH).

So the substituents at positions 3 (CHO) and 5 (CN) are correct.

Therefore, option D correctly lists the substituents in alphabetical order with their respective positions.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (COOH) as the principal functional group. The substituents are arranged as follows:

1. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** is at position 1.
2. **Formyl group (CHO)** is at position 3 (meta to COOH).
3. **Cyano group (CN)** is at position 5 (meta to COOH and to the formyl group).
4. **Dimethylamino group (N(CH₃)₂)** is at position 2 (ortho to COOH).
5. **Hydroxyl group (OH)** is at position 6 (ortho to COOH and to the cyano group).
6. **Methoxy group (OMe)** is at position 4 (para to COOH and ortho to the cyano group).

In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. The alphabetical order of the substituents is: **cyano (CN)**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxyl**, **methoxy**. Each substituent is prefixed with its position number on the benzene ring.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is:

**5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is a formyl group), and a cyano group. These three are meta to each other. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl groups are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group).

Hmm, that's a bit to unpack. Let me draw a benzene ring to visualize this. The ring has six positions, numbered 1 through 6. I'll consider the carboxylic acid as the first point of reference, perhaps at position 1.

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, right? So the numbering should start such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the other substituents are numbered relative to that.

So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. The substituents meta to each other are the carboxylic acid, the formyl group, and the cyano group. So if the carboxylic acid is at 1, the formyl and cyano are at 3 and 5, perhaps? Because in a benzene ring, meta positions are two apart. So 1,3,5 would be meta to each other. Wait, no. Wait, meta positions are two carbons apart. So for a benzene ring, each substituent is two positions away from another in the meta arrangement.

Wait, let me think. If I have substituents A, B, and C all in the meta positions relative to each other, their positions would be such that each is separated by two carbons. So for a benzene ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 would each be two positions apart from each other. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the formyl could be at 3, and the cyano at 5. Or any permutation of that.

But wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is meta to the other two. So the three groups are at positions 1,3,5.

Now, ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So ortho positions to 1 are 2 and 6. So at positions 2 and 6, we have -OH and -N(CH3)2. Wait, but which is which? That's something I'll need to figure out based on other information.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is position 4. So position 4 has OMe.

Additionally, the methoxy group (position 4) and the hydroxyl group (either position 2 or 6) are both ortho to the nitrile group. The nitrile is at position 5 (from earlier), but wait, let's see.

Wait, the methoxy is at position 4, and the hydroxyl is either 2 or 6. Let's say the hydroxyl is at 2. Then, the nitrile group is at position 5. So for position 5 (cyano), its ortho positions are 4 and 6. So if the methoxy is at 4 and the hydroxyl is at 2, the hydroxyl isn't ortho to the cyano. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to reorient my thinking. Let me re-examine the substituents.

Let me number the ring as follows:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
2: ?
3: CHO (carbaldehyde)
4: OMe (methoxy)
5: CN (cyano)
6: ?

Wait, the carboxylic acid is at 1. The formyl is at 3, meta to 1. The cyano is at 5, which is meta to both 1 and 3. So positions 1,3,5 have COOH, CHO, CN.

Ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6 are hydroxyl and dimethyl amino.

Para to COOH is position 4; that's OMe.

So, positions 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2. Let's figure out which is which.

Now, the methoxy group (position 4) and the hydroxyl (say, position 2) are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5). Wait, nitrile is at 5. Positions ortho to 5 are 4 and 6. So if the methoxy is at 4, then it's ortho to 5. The hydroxyl is at 2, which is not ortho to 5. Hmm, that's an issue. Because the question states that both the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile.

So in that arrangement, the hydroxyl is at 2 and the nitrile is at 5. For the hydroxyl to be ortho to the nitrile (5), it needs to be at position 4 or 6. But position 4 is OMe, so the hydroxyl can't be there. Therefore, perhaps the hydroxyl is at 6.

Wait, let me try this again. Let's say COOH is at 1, CHO at 3, CN at 5. Then positions ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2.

Also, the methoxy is at 4 (para to COOH). Now, the question says that the methoxy (position 4) and the alcohol (let's say at 6) are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5).

Wait, position 5's ortho positions are 4 and 6. So if the nitrile is at 5, the substituents at 4 and 6 are ortho to it. The methoxy is at 4, and the hydroxyl is at 6. So yes, both are ortho to the nitrile. That makes sense.

So, substituents:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
3: CHO
4: OMe
5: CN
6: OH

Wait, that's the arrangement.

So, let me list the substituents in order of priority. The functional groups are:

Carboxylic acid (COOH) - highest priority.

Then, we have the substituents:

At position 2: dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
Position 3: formyl (CHO)
Position 4: methoxy (OMe)
Position 5: cyano (CN)
Position 6: hydroxyl (OH)

Wait, but wait, the priority order for substituents in IUPAC naming is based on alphabetical order, but the numbering is based on the substituents to get the lowest possible numbers. Oh, but the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts from there.

Wait, no. The numbering starts from the substituent that gives the lowest numbers to the other substituents, considering the principal functional group. Wait, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid as position 1. So we don't need to change that.

Now, the substituents are:

Position 2: dimethylamino
Position 3: formyl
Position 4: methoxy
Position 5: cyano
Position 6: hydroxyl

Wait, but I thought the substituents at 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2. So in this arrangement, position 2 is N(CH3)2 and 6 is OH.

Wait, no: I thought that the substituents ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6. So 2 and 6 have N(CH3)2 and OH. But according to the other condition, the methoxy (4) and the OH (6) are ortho to the CN (5). That works because 5's ortho are 4 and 6.

So, substituents:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2
3: CHO
4: OMe
5: CN
6: OH

Now, the IUPAC name would be based on this numbering.

The substituents are:

At position 2: (dimethylamino)
Position 3: formyl
Position 4: methoxy
Position 5: cyano
Position 6: hydroxyl

Wait, but wait, in IUPAC naming, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but the positions are determined by the numbering starting at the principal group and giving the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

But wait, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to the principal functional group. So after the principal group (COOH at 1), the other substituents are numbered from 2 to 6 in order.

But, the substituents are:

2: dimethylamino
3: formyl
4: methoxy
5: cyano
6: hydroxyl

So, the name would be benzoic acid with substituents in the order of their positions. So the substituents are numbered in the order of their positions around the ring, starting from the principal group.

Wait, but when writing the substituents, the order is alphabetical, but the positions are in the order they appear around the ring.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given as their numbers in the order around the ring.

But wait, the actual order of substituents in the name is based on their priority, not necessarily their positions. Let me think again. IUPAC rules say that substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. So, the substituent that comes first alphabetically is listed first.

So, the substituents here are: CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

CN is first in the alphabetical order: C comes before D, F, H, M.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but let me list them:

- cyano (CN)
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
- formyl (CHO)
- hydroxyl (OH)
- methoxy (OCH3)

So alphabetical order is CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

But wait, "dimethylamino" starts with D, so after C. So first is CN, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

Wait, but the question is about the correct IUPAC name. So the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given based on their numbering.

Wait, but the numbering is fixed based on the principal group. The substituents are numbered 2,3,4,5,6, and their substituents are at those positions.

So the name would be:

benzoic acid with substituents at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), and 6 (hydroxyl).

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up some positions. Let's recount. From the earlier analysis, the substituents are:

1: COOH (position 1)
2: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
3: CHO (formyl)
4: OMe (methoxy)
5: CN (cyano)
6: OH (hydroxyl)

So the substituents are at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxyl).

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are written in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the order would be:

CN comes first (as cyano), then dimethylamino (as it starts with D), then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

But wait, no: 'hydroxyl' starts with H, which comes after D, F, and M.

Wait, no. Let's list all substituents:

- cyano (CN): C
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2): D
- formyl (CHO): F
- hydroxyl (OH): H
- methoxy (OCH3): M

So alphabetical order is C, D, F, H, M.

So the substituents in the name would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Each with their respective positions. Let's write them in order.

So the name would start with benzoic acid, then the substituents in order:

1. 3-cyano
2. 6-(dimethylamino)
3. 5-formyl
4. 2-hydroxy
5. 4-methoxy

Wait, wait, let's see. No, because the substituent at position 3 is formyl.

Wait no, the substituents are at position 3: formyl.

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The substituents are:

Position 2: dimethylamino
Position 3: formyl
Position 4: methoxy
Position 5: cyano
Position 6: hydroxyl

So in the name, after benzoic acid, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each prefixed by their position number.

Wait, but the positions are in the order of their numbering around the ring. Wait, no, the positions are determined by their order around the ring when numbered starting from the principal group.

So, the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6. So when writing the name, each substituent is indicated by its position, but the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of their names.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order are:

1. cyano (position 5)
2. dimethylamino (position 2)
3. formyl (position 3)
4. hydroxyl (position 6)
5. methoxy (position 4)

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me list the substituents and their positions:

- cyano: position 5
- dimethylamino: position 2
- formyl: position 3
- hydroxyl: position 6
- methoxy: position 4

So the alphabetical order is:

1. cyano (5)
2. dimethylamino (2)
3. formyl (3)
4. hydroxyl (6)
5. methoxy (4)

So the name would be: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that matches.

Wait, let me check the options.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's the same as what I came up with.

Alternatively, let me check the other options.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That would imply substituents at 3 (CN), 6 (dimethylamino), 5 (CHO), 2 (OH), 4 (OMe). But in our structure, CN is at 5. So option A is not correct.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Hmm, substituents at 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OMe), 5 (CHO), 6 (NMe2). But in our structure, substituents at 2 is NMe2, 3 is CHO, 4 is OMe, 5 is CN, 6 is OH. So no, this option doesn't match.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents: 2 (NMe2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OMe),5 (CN),6 (OH). That's the same as our structure. Wait, so what's the difference between option D and option C?

Wait, option C is: 2-(dimethylamino)..., 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano,6-hydroxy.

Which would correspond to substituents at 2,3,4,5,6 as NMe2, CHO, OMe, CN, OH.

But wait, in our case, the substituents are:

2: NMe2
3: CHO
4: OMe
5: CN
6: OH

Which matches option D's substituents except for the order.

Wait, no. The options are written in a particular order. Let me read the options again.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So the substituent order is cyano (5), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4). So in the name, the substituents are in alphabetical order, which they are.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents here are:

2: dimethylamino
3: formyl
4: methoxy
5: cyano
6: hydroxy

Which is the same as in our structure. So this is option C.

Wait, but I thought option D also had the same substituents, but in a different order in the name.

Wait, no, no. The substituents are in the same order because the substituents are organized alphabetically regardless of their positions. So the correct name would have the substituents in alphabetical order, which is CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but in option C, the substituents are listed as:

2-(dimethylamino),3-formyl,4-methoxy,5-cyano,6-hydroxy.

Which is not in alphabetical order.

Wait, no. Because in the IUPAC name, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. So the order in the name would be CN first, then dimethylamino, etc.

So the correct name should have the substituents ordered as CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name would start with 5-cyano, then 2-(dimethylamino), etc.

Which is exactly what option D says.

So why is option C not correct? Because in option C, the substituents are listed in the order of their positions, which is not the correct alphabetical order.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Because I thought the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the correct name would have the substituents arranged alphabetically, each with their position number.

So, in the name, the substituents would be written as:

5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which is what option D says.

So the correct answer would be option D.

But wait, let me just double-check each substituent's position.

COOH is at 1.

Ortho to COOH (1) are 2 and 6. So substituents at 2 and 6 are NMe2 and OH. Since the substituents in option D are 2-(dimethylamino) and 6-hydroxy, that makes sense.

The methoxy is at 4 (para to COOH).

The formyl is at 3 (meta to COOH), and the cyano is at 5 (meta to COOH).

So the substituents at positions 3 (CHO) and 5 (CN) are correct.

Therefore, option D correctly lists the substituents in alphabetical order with their respective positions.

So the correct answer is D.


The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (COOH) as the principal functional group. The substituents are arranged as follows:

1. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** is at position 1.
2. **Formyl group (CHO)** is at position 3 (meta to COOH).
3. **Cyano group (CN)** is at position 5 (meta to COOH and to the formyl group).
4. **Dimethylamino group (N(CH₃)₂)** is at position 2 (ortho to COOH).
5. **Hydroxyl group (OH)** is at position 6 (ortho to COOH and to the cyano group).
6. **Methoxy group (OMe)** is at position 4 (para to COOH and ortho to the cyano group).

In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. The alphabetical order of the substituents is: **cyano (CN)**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxyl**, **methoxy**. Each substituent is prefixed with its position number on the benzene ring.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is:

**5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
