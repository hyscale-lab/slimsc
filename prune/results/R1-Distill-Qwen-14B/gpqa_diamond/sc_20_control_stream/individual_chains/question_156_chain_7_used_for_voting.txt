Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I should remember what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the configuration of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, but what about the conditions after that? The problem says each reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right! In acidic conditions, epoxides can undergo ring-opening reactions. The acid catalyzes the opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. In aqueous acid, water is the nucleophile. So the epoxide will open into a diol.

But wait, the epoxide is formed first, then the acid work-up. So for each starting alkene, we'll get an epoxide, which then becomes a diol.

Now, considering the stereochemistry. Let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. Since mCPBA adds an epoxide group in a stereospecific manner, the geometry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration. For (E) alkenes, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added across the double bond with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, another approach: when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. Because mCPBA is a peracid, which is a good electrophile. The reaction is an electrocyclic process, perhaps involving a cyclic transition state. So for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide's stereochemistry will differ.

Wait, maybe I should consider the type of epoxide formed. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each double bond carbon are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on the same face. Let me think: mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Wait, no, wait. No, the addition of the oxygen is syn. Oh, wait, no, wait. No, mCPBA addition is an electrocyclic ring-opening of the peracid followed by a conjugate addition, which is a concerted process that can lead to either syn or anti addition.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via a cyclic transition state. The peracid attacks the double bond, leading to an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene. So if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have a certain configuration, and if it's Z, it will have another.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think about the endo transition state. For example, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a trans fashion. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, another approach: think about the structure of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. (E) has the two higher priority groups on opposite sides, (Z) on the same.

When mCPBA adds to (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will form such that the two new oxygen atoms are added in a trans fashion? Or maybe the same.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. Let's imagine oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. For (E), the two methyl groups (or whatever substituents) are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The peracid adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide with the oxygen atoms on opposite sides? Or same?

Wait, no, mCPBA adds with syn addition. Because the peracid's oxygen attacks the same face of the double bond. So for an (E) double bond, the two substituents are opposite. Adding oxygen on the same face would lead to the epoxide oxygen atoms being on the same face as each other.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product after mCPBA treatment. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the two new oxygen atoms on the same face (cis) relative to the original double bond substituents, leading to a trans epoxide? Or maybe a cis epoxide?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond with a specific stereochemistry. When the starting alkene is (E), the epoxide formed is trans. Wait, no, the (E) configuration refers to the substituents on either end of the double bond. The epoxide formation would create a new ring where the oxygen bridges the two carbons, and the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of mCPBA with alkenes forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So for (E)-alkene, the epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide. Or maybe the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the epoxidation using mCPBA is stereospecific but leads to a trans-epoxide. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, for an (E) double bond, the substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the substituents on the adjacent carbons are also on opposite sides. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the process as leading to a cis epoxide when the starting alkene is trans, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the diastereomer formed after the acid work-up. Because after epoxidation, when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it undergoes ring-opening to form a diol.

Wait, the key here is that the epoxide ring opening in acidic conditions is an SN2-like mechanism, so the nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group. Wait, but in epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions, the more substituted carbon tends to be the one that's protonated because it's more stable. Wait, no, actually, in acid-catalyzed ring opening, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, leading to a better leaving group (water). Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic. But the attack occurs from the opposite side due to the transition state's structure, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, let me clarify: when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (maybe due to carbocation-like transition state). The attack is from the opposite side, leading to trans addition.

So, the configuration of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide. Therefore, each starting alkene will form a different epoxide, which upon acid hydrolysis gives a different diol.

Now, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA forms an epoxide. Then, acid work-up gives a diol. Similarly for Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA forms a different epoxide, leading to a different diol upon acid work-up.

Wait, but what's the structure of the diol in each case? Let's imagine oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, no, wait, octene is C8H16. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3â€”no, wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, let's correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. So it's actually CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no.

Wait, perhaps an easier way. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. No, wait, the actual structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5, making it CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. So, the double bond is between C4 and C5.

Now, for the (E) and (Z) isomers.

(E)-oct-4-ene has the two higher priority groups (probably the two CH2CH3 groups) on opposite sides of the double bond. So when mCPBA adds an epoxide, the oxygen atoms will be added on the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or maybe the same.

Wait, but when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the two substituents (the CH2CH2CH3 groups) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring, making it a trans epoxide.

Then, when acid is added, the epoxide opens to form a diol. The ring opening is via SN2 mechanism, so the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side. So, for a trans epoxide, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the former double bond.

Wait, but the exact configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps for each starting alkene, the epoxide is formed with a certain configuration, and upon acid treatment, each gives a diol with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide where the substituents are trans. Then, upon acid treatment, this epoxide forms a diol with the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (because the attack is from opposite sides). Wait, no. Let me think: when the epoxide is trans, meaning the substituents on either side of the oxygen bridge are on opposite sides. When it opens in acid, the attack happens at each carbon, leading to the diol.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific diastereomers formed. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans, so when the acid work-up occurs, the diol formed would have a specific configuration. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be cis, leading to a different diol.

Wait, let me try to imagine the (E) and (Z) epoxides.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite. So the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms adding on the same face, creating a trans epoxide. Then, when the acid is added, each oxygen becomes a better leaving group. The nucleophilic attack occurs on the more substituted carbon (each carbon in the epoxide is equally substituted here, since it's symmetric). So, each water attacks from the opposite side, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have both hydroxyl groups on the same side, making it a trans diol? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific example. Take (E)-2-butene. mCPBA would form an epoxide. Then, in acid, the epoxide would ring-open to form a diol. Since the starting alkene is E, the epoxide would have the two substituents (like CH3 groups) on opposite sides. So, when the epoxide opens, each -OH adds from the opposite side. So the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side because the epoxide was trans. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the diastereomer formed. For each starting alkene, the epoxide is formed, and upon acid work-up, each gives a diol with a specific stereochemistry. Since the starting alkenes are enantiomers (E and Z for a symmetric molecule?), the diols would be diastereomers.

Wait, but wait: oct-4-ene is symmetric. So, (E) and (Z) would have different structures, but perhaps the diols from each are enantiomers.

Wait, no, oct-4-ene is symmetric. So (E) and (Z) are actually the same because the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. The groups on either end of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH3. But wait, no, both ends are CH2CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH3? No, wait, no, both sides are CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3, but wait, actually, each side is CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3? No, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps a better approach is to think that the molecule is symmetric, so (E) and (Z) are enantiomers?

Wait, no. For a molecule to be symmetric, the substituents on either side of the double bond must be the same. If the substituents are different, the molecule isn't symmetric. So, in oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are -CH2CH2CH2CH3 and -CH2CH2CH3. So they are different, meaning the molecule isn't symmetric. Therefore, (E) and (Z) are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

So when (E) and (Z) alkenes undergo epoxidation, they form different epoxides. Then, upon acid treatment, each gives a diol with different stereochemistry.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ diol (let's say Diol A).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide â†’ diol (Diol B).

Now, are Diol A and Diol B enantiomers or diastereomers? Since their starting alkenes are diastereomers, the products would be diastereomers as well. So, Diol A and Diol B are diastereomers, but what about their own configurations?

Wait, but wait. If the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), and the epoxidation leads to different epoxides, which upon acid treatment give different diols, which are diastereomers, then when you mix Diol A and Diol B, what happens in the HPLC?

Now, the question is about running the product mixture on standard (achiral) HPLC and chiral HPLC.

In standard HPLC, the column is achiral. So, if the diols are enantiomers, they would co-elute because the column can't distinguish them. But if they are diastereomers, they would elute at different times, giving separate peaks.

Wait, but in this case, Diol A and Diol B from the E and Z starting alkenes are diastereomers, so in the standard HPLC, they would show two separate peaks.

But wait, maybe each diol has its own set of stereoisomers. Wait, no. Wait, each reaction gives a single diol because the reaction goes to 100% completion. So Reaction 1 gives only Diol A, and Reaction 2 gives only Diol B. Then, when you mix them, you have two different diols in the mixture.

Wait, but wait. Are Diol A and Diol B themselves chiral? Let me think. The diol comes from the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide.

If the diol has two stereocenters, then each diol could be a pair of enantiomers or a single compound if meso.

Wait, perhaps the diol from each epoxide has two stereocenters, and whether they are the same or different.

Wait, let's think about the product of the acid work-up. When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it forms a diol. If the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be meso. But in our case, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), leading to different epoxides, which upon acid treatment give different diols.

Wait, maybe each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but I don't think so. Alternatively, each diol could be a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer.

Wait, let me think. The epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, upon acid treatment, forms a diol. Since the epoxide is trans, the ring-opening would lead to a diol with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides. Wait, but maybe the diol is a trans diol, making it a single enantiomer or a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E) is a cis diol, and the one from (Z) is a trans diol, or vice versa.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach it differently.

Let's imagine the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene: when mCPBA adds to (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the two new oxygens on the same face (since (E) has substituents opposite). Or maybe on opposite faces. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide from (E) is trans, meaning the substituents on either side of the epoxide are opposite. Then, when the epoxide opens in acid, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side (since the attack is from the opposite side of each oxygen).

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the diastereomerism. Each starting alkene gives a different diol, which are diastereomers. So, in the mixture, you have two diastereomers, each of which may be a pair of enantiomers or a single compound.

Wait, but the problem says that both reactions go to 100% completion. So, each reaction gives a single diol product. Therefore, when you mix the products, you have two different diols.

Now, in the standard HPLC (achiral), how would these diols elute? If they are not enantiomers, they would elute as separate peaks. If they are enantiomers, they would elute together.

But wait, Diol A from (E) and Diol B from (Z) are diastereomers, so they would show up as two separate peaks on the standard HPLC.

Wait, but each diol is possibly a pair of enantiomers. No, wait, no. Each diol is a single compound, because each reaction produces a single diastereomer. Because the starting alkene is either (E) or (Z), leading to a specific epoxide, which leads to a specific diol.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a single stereoisomer. So, when you put them together, you have two different diols, which are diastereomers, leading to two peaks on the standard HPLC.

But wait, what if each diol has multiple stereocenters and some are meso compounds?

Hmm. Let's think about the diol.

After the epoxide opens, the diol has two -OH groups on adjacent carbons. The configuration depends on how the epoxide was formed.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a specific configuration upon ring opening. So, when the epoxide is in acid, the attack occurs on each carbon from the opposite side, leading to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same face.

Wait, no, let's imagine the epoxide is trans (from (E) starting alkene). The two substituents on either side of the epoxide are opposite. So, during ring opening, each -OH adds to the opposite side of the leaving group. So, the diol would have the two -OH groups on the same side, making it a cis diol. But wait, if the epoxide is trans, and the attack is from opposite sides, the diol would have a trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it like this: the epoxide oxygen is in a ring, with the two adjacent carbons each attached to their own substituents. For a trans epoxide, the substituents on each carbon are opposite each other. When the acid opens it, water attacks each carbon from the opposite side, leading to the diol.

So, in the case of (E) â†’ trans epoxide â†’ diol with trans configuration. Or is it cis?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of a specific example. Take trans-2,3-epoxybutane. When it's treated with acid, it opens to form a diol. If the epoxide is trans, the diol will have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the diol ends up with the same configuration as the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol will have the same relative configuration as the epoxide.

Wait, another approach: the diol's configuration depends on the original epoxide's configuration. If the epoxide was cis, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis), and if the epoxide was trans, the diol would have the hydroxyls on opposite sides (trans).

Wait, but I'm not certain about this. Let me think: when the epoxide is cis, the two substituents on each carbon are on the same face. When it opens, each attack is from the opposite side, so the diol ends up with hydroxyls on the same face. So, a cis diol. For a trans epoxide, the substituents are on opposite faces, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the starting epoxide is cis, the diol is cis, and if the epoxide is trans, the diol is trans.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ trans epoxide â†’ trans diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene â†’ cis epoxide â†’ cis diol.

Wait, but wait. (E) and (Z) are the configurations of the starting alkenes. How does that affect the epoxide's cis or trans configuration?

mCPBA adds an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, (E) would lead to an epoxide with the two oxygens on the same face, which would be a cis epoxide? Or opposite.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. (E) means that the two higher priority groups are opposite each other. So, when mCPBA adds, the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face, leading to a trans epoxide. Because if the substituents were opposite, the oxygen atoms would end up on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps that's right. So, (E) â†’ trans epoxide â†’ trans diol.

(Z) â†’ cis epoxide â†’ cis diol.

So, Reaction 1: trans diol â†’ let's call it Diol A.

Reaction 2: cis diol â†’ Diol B.

Now, each diol is a single compound, but perhaps they have their own stereochemistry. So, when you mix Diol A and Diol B, you have two different diols.

But wait, are these diols chiral? A diol with two adjacent stereocenters can be chiral unless it's a meso compound.

In the case of a trans diol, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral. Similarly, a cis diol might also be a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about the structure. For trans-diol from (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol structure would be HO-C2H4CH2CH2-OH (but with the hydroxyls on opposite sides). Wait, no, wait. No, the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, each with their own configuration.

Wait, perhaps a more precise analysis is needed. Let's imagine the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene: after epoxidation and acid treatment, the diol would have two stereocenters, each with opposite configurations. So, it's (2R,3S) and (2S,3R), which would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Wait, wait. If the diol has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So, for example, 2,3-butanediol can be either erythrose (cis) or threose (trans), but erythrose is a meso compound and hence achiral, while threose has two enantiomers.

Wait, let me correct: (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) are enantiomers; (2R,3S) and (2S,3R) are the same because of the plane of symmetry, making them a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, if the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, it would be a meso compound and thus achiral. Whereas the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene would be a cis diol, which could be a pair of enantiomers (if not a meso compound) or itself a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about the cis diol. If the two stereocenters are both R and both S, that's threose, which is chiral (has two enantiomers). If one is R and the other S, that's erythrose, which is a meso compound, hence achiral.

Wait, but in our case, the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene would be a cis diol, which would be a meso compound if the stereocenters are opposite, or a chiral compound if both are same.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the diol structure.

After mCPBA and acid treatment, the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol. If the molecule is symmetrical, it would be a meso compound, hence achiral.

Similarly, the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene would be a cis diol. If the molecule is symmetrical, it would be a meso compound, but if not, it would be chiral.

But wait, in our case, the starting molecule is oct-4-ene. So, the diol would have the structure HOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the diol would be at positions 4 and 5.

Wait, no, the epoxide is at 4 and 5, so after ring-opening, the diol is at 4 and 5. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, the positions 4 and 5 would have the diol. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2CH2CH3.

Now, the question is whether this diol is a meso compound or not.

If the two stereocenters (on C4 and C5) are both R and S, respectively, or vice versa, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound (achiral).

If both are R or both are S, there's no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, for the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene, is it a meso compound?

If after the acid treatment, the diol has the two OH groups on opposite sides (trans), then the configurations would be R and S, making it a meso compound. So, Diol A is achiral.

For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have the two OH groups on the same side (cis). So, the configurations would be R and R or S and S, making the diol chiral. So, Diol B is chiral and exists as two enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, the reaction goes to 100% completion, so each reaction gives a single product. So, Diol B would be a single enantiomer, or a racemic mixture? No, wait, the reaction produces a single enantiomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, but in our case, the starting materials are (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, which are diastereomers, not enantiomers. So, each would produce a single diol product, which could be either achiral or chiral.

Wait, perhaps for (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol is a meso compound (achiral), and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol is a chiral compound, which would exist as a racemic mixture unless the reaction leads to a specific enantiomer.

Wait, but in the case of (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is formed in a way that leads to a specific configuration upon acid treatment. So, the diol would be a single enantiomer, not a racemic mix.

Wait, no. The reaction would proceed with high stereoselectivity, so each starting material would produce one specific diastereomer. So, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have both OH groups on the same face, leading to a chiral diol with a specific configuration.

But wait, if the diol is chiral, it would exist as two enantiomers. But in this case, each reaction produces only one enantiomer, not a racemic mix.

Wait, but how can that be? Because the starting material is a single diastereomer, the reaction would produce a single diastereomer diol, which could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each starting material produces a single diol, which may or may not be chiral.

Let me get back to the problem.

After Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, the products are Diol A (from E) and Diol B (from Z).

Assuming Diol A is a meso compound (achiral), then it would appear as a single peak on both standard and chiral HPLC.

Diol B is chiral, so it would appear as two peaks on chiral HPLC (enantiomers), but as a single peak on standard HPLC.

So, when you mix Diol A and Diol B, what would happen.

In standard HPLC (achiral), you would see two peaks: one for Diol A (single peak) and one for Diol B (single peak, but Diol B is a pair of enantiomers, but in solution, they are present as one compound because the reaction gives a single enantiomer? Or does it give a racemic mix? Wait, no. The reaction is 100% complete, but the starting material is a single diastereomer, so the product is a single diastereomer, which could be a single enantiomer or a pair of enantiomers (if it's a meso compound).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Reaction 1 produces Diol A, which is a meso compound (achiral). So in standard HPLC, it's a single peak. In chiral HPLC, since it's achiral, it's also a single peak.

Reaction 2 produces Diol B, which is chiral. So in standard HPLC, it's a single peak (since the column can't distinguish enantiomers). In chiral HPLC, it would split into two peaks (enantiomers).

But wait, the reaction goes to 100% completion, but if the starting material is a single diastereomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, which may be a pair of enantiomers or a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps Diol B is a single enantiomer because the reaction is stereoselective.

Wait, no. If the diol is chiral, then the reaction would produce a single enantiomer if the reagent and conditions are stereoselective enough. But in reality, without any other chiral centers, perhaps Diol B is a single enantiomer.

Wait, but in this case, the diol from (Z) is chiral and, as a result, would have two enantiomers. But the reaction produces only one of them because the starting material is a single diastereomer.

So, when the chemist combines the products, Diol A (achiral) and Diol B (single enantiomer of a chiral diol), what happens in the HPLC?

On standard HPLC:

- Diol A: 1 peak (achiral).

- Diol B: 1 peak (because the column can't tell enantiomers apart).

Total: 2 peaks.

On chiral HPLC:

- Diol A: 1 peak (achiral).

- Diol B: 2 peaks (the two enantiomers).

Total: 3 peaks.

So, the standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks.

Looking at the options:

Option B says 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me recheck.

Wait, Diol A is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. So in chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

Diol B is chiral, so in chiral HPLC, it would split into two peaks.

So the total peaks:

Standard: Diol A (1) + Diol B (1) â†’ 2 peaks.

Chiral: Diol A (1) + Diol B (2) â†’ 3 peaks.

Yes, that's correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene
- The (E)-oct-4-ene has substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. mCPBA adds an epoxide group in a stereospecific manner, resulting in a **trans-epoxide**.
- In acidic conditions, the trans-epoxide undergoes ring-opening via an SN2-like mechanism, leading to a **trans-diol**. This trans-diol is a **meso compound** (achiral) due to its plane of symmetry.

### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene
- The (Z)-oct-4-ene has substituents on the same side of the double bond. mCPBA adds an epoxide group, resulting in a **cis-epoxide**.
- In acidic conditions, the cis-epoxide undergoes ring-opening, leading to a **cis-diol**. This cis-diol is **chiral** and exists as two enantiomers.

### Combining the Products
- The products of the two reactions are:
  1. **Diol A**: Trans-diol (achiral, meso compound).
  2. **Diol B**: Cis-diol (chiral, exists as two enantiomers).

### Chromatographic Analysis
1. **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:
   - Diol A (achiral) appears as a single peak.
   - Diol B (chiral) also appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot distinguish enantiomers.
   - Total: **2 peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Diol A (achiral) appears as a single peak.
   - Diol B (chiral) splits into two peaks corresponding to its two enantiomers.
   - Total: **3 peaks**.

### Conclusion
The standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, while the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks. This matches **Option B**.
