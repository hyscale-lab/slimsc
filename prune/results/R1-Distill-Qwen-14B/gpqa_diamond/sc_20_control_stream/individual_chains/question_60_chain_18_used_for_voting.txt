Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation, right? Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. So the astronaut's time would experience less time compared to someone observing from Earth. Wait, but wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective.

The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long it takes them to reach Earth from their own point of view. Oh wait, but the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. So I need to calculate the time it takes from their frame of reference.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? I think it has to do with the distance and the speed. So first, I need to figure out how far the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? I think its distance is about 160,000 light-years away. Or wait, was it 170? Or maybe something else. Let me think—maybe I should look that up. Oh wait, no, I can't. I'll just proceed with what I remember.

Assuming the distance is about 163,000 light-years. The speed is 0.99999987c, which is almost c but slightly less. So, from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So, 163,000 ly / 0.99999987. Let me compute that.

Wait, 163,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Since 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. So, 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013). Let's calculate that. 163000 * 0.00000013 is about 163000 * 1.3e-7 = approximately 0.02119. So the total is about 163,000.021 years, which is almost 163,000 years. But wait, that's from Earth's perspective. But the question is from the astronaut's perspective.

Oh wait, no, from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the proper length (from Earth's frame) is L0, and the astronaut's frame sees L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the distance they experience is shorter.

Wait, so the astronaut's frame would see the distance as contracted. So distance = L0 * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v = 0.99999987c. So v squared is (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974 (since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x; but 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7, so (1-1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7). So v²/c² ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 which is about 3.16e-4. Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.09e-4.

So the contracted distance L = L0 * 5.09e-4. L0 is approximately 163,000 light-years. So L = 163,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ let's calculate that. 163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.000009 is about 1.467. So total L ≈ 81.5 + 1.467 ≈ 82.967 light-years.

Wait, so the distance they travel is about 83 light-years (approx 83 ly). At a speed of v ≈ 0.99999987c, the time experienced by the astronaut is t = L / v. So t = (82.967 ly) / 0.99999987c.

Since 1 ly at speed c is 1 year, then the time in the astronaut's frame is (82.967 / 0.99999987) years. Let's compute that.

Divide 82.967 by approximately 1 (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1). So t ≈ 82.967 years. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because 82.967 divided by 0.99999987 is about 82.967 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.967 + (82.967 * 0.00000013). Let's compute that. 82.967 * 0.00000013 is approximately 0.010785. So t ≈ 82.967 + 0.010785 ≈ 82.978 years. So approximately 83 years.

But wait, the astronaut's age is 22 years old. If it takes about 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old. But their average lifetime is 150 years, so 105 is less than that. So they would survive.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because maybe I made a mistake in the contraction factor. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for time dilation is different. Because from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the time experienced by them is (contracted distance) / speed.

Contracted distance = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163,000 ly * sqrt(1- (0.99999987)^2).

Wait, let me compute v squared again more accurately. (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x². So x is 1.3e-7, x² is 1.69e-14, which is negligible. So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1-2.6e-7. So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.6e-7. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4, so 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4 as before.

So the contraction factor is 5.09e-4, which is very small. So the contracted distance is about 83 light-years as before.

Time is then 83 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 83 years. Because 83 ly / (0.99999987c) = 83 * (1/0.99999987) years. 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, so 83 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.000108 years. So about 83 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B) 72 years.

C) 81 years.

D)77 years.

Hmm, so 83 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake in the distance?

Wait, maybe the distance is different. Wait, I thought the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. But perhaps it's closer. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. I remember that the Small Magellanic Cloud is about 200,000 light-years away, but the Large is closer, maybe like 170,000 or so? Wait, no, maybe the Large is around 160,000. So I used 163,000. Maybe that's incorrect. Maybe the actual distance is about 150,000? Or perhaps 170,000, which would change the calculation.

Wait, but regardless, let me think about the calculation again. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). With v = 0.99999987c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974. Then 1 - v²/c² is 2.6e-7.

So gamma is approximately 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root is sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.09e-4, so 1 divided by that is about 1963. So gamma is approximately 1963.

Wait, but that's a huge gamma. So from Earth's frame, the time taken is (distance) / (v) = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.02 years.

From Earth's frame, it takes about 163,000 years. But from the astronaut's frame, the time is much less due to time dilation. The time experienced by the astronaut is t = t_earth / gamma. Wait no, wait, wait. Time experienced in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame) is t = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

But wait, t_earth is 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. So t = 163,000 / gamma. Gamma is about 1963.

So t ≈ 163,000 / 1963 ≈ let's compute this. 1963 * 80 is 157,040. 157,040 is less than 163,000. 163,000 - 157,040 = 5,960. 5,960 / 1963 ≈ about 3.03. So total approx 80 + 3 = 83.03 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options don't have 83. The closest option is C) 81 years, or D)77. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the contraction factor. Let me try another approach. The time in the astronaut's frame can be found using the formula t = (distance) / v, where distance is contracted.

Wait, because in their frame, the Earth is moving towards them at 0.99999987c, and the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So L is 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Compute that:

sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 ) = sqrt( (1 - 0.99999987)(1 + 0.99999987) ) = sqrt( (2.6e-7)(1.99999987) ) ≈ sqrt( 5.1999997e-7 ) = approx 0.000721.

Wait, wait: sqrt(5.2e-7) is approximately sqrt(5.2)*1e-3.5. sqrt(5.2) is about 2.28, and 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 2.28 *3.16e-4 ≈ 7.21e-4, so 0.000721.

So L = 163000 * 0.000721 ≈ 163000 * 7.21e-4 ≈ 163000 * 0.000721.

Calculate that: 163000 * 0.0007 = 114.1, and 163000 * 0.000021 = approximately 3.423. So total L ≈ 114.1 + 3.423 ≈ 117.523 light-years.

So time for the astronaut is t = L / v = 117.523 / 0.99999987 ≈ 117.523 * 1.00000013 ≈ 117.523 + 0.000152 ≈ 117.523 years.

Wait, that's about 118 years. But wait, that's not matching any of the options either. I must have messed up somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I should recheck the contraction factor again. Oh wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me redo the contraction factor.

Wait, 1 - v²/c² = (1 - 0.99999987)(1 + 0.99999987) ) = (0.00000013)(1.99999987 ) ≈ 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, as I computed earlier. So L = L0 * 5.099e-4.

L0 is 163,000 ly. So L = 163,000 *5.099e-4 = 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.87 ly.

So t = 82.87 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.87 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.87 + (82.87 * 0.00000013) ≈ 82.87 + 0.01077 ≈ 82.88 years.

So t is about 83 years. Again, not matching any option.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. Did I make a mistake in the actual distance? Maybe the distance isn't 163,000 ly. Let me think again. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 170,000 light-years away. Let me use 170,000 ly instead.

So L0 = 170,000 ly. Then, L = 170,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 170,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 86.7 light-years.

Then t = 86.7 / 0.99999987 ≈ 86.7 * 1.00000013 ≈ 86.7 + 0.001126 ≈ 86.701 years.

Still, that's about 86.7 years, which would push the astronaut's age to 22 + 86.7 = 108.7, which is still under 150, so they'd live. But the options don't have 86. So maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering time from the astronaut's perspective without considering the contraction. Or perhaps I should use the time from the Earth's frame and then apply time dilation. Let me try that approach.

From Earth's frame, time is t_earth = distance / speed = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

In the astronaut's frame, the time is t = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 ) ≈ 163000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.87 years.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the proper time formula, which is the time experienced by the traveler. Proper time is calculated using the Lorentz factor.

Proper time τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

Which brings me back to the same calculation. So τ ≈ 82.87 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 81 years, which is about 81. So perhaps 83 is close enough to 81? Or maybe my initial distance was wrong. If the distance is 160,000 ly instead of 163,000.

Wait, let's recalculate with 160,000 ly.

L0 = 160,000.

L = 160,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.584 light-years.

Time t = 81.584 /0.99999987 ≈81.584 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81.584 + 0.000106 ≈ 81.584 years. So approx 81.6 years. Which is about 82, but closest to option C) 81 years.

But wait, the options are 72, 81, 77, etc. So 81 is an option. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So they would reach Earth when they are 22 + 81 = 103 years old. Their average lifetime is 150, so they'd live.

So the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83, so perhaps the correct answer is C) 81.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the contraction factor.

Wait, another approach: if the speed is v=0.99999987c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) ≈ 1964. So the time in Earth frame is t_earth = 160,000 ly / v = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

The astronaut's experienced time is t = t_earth / gamma = 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 81.38 years. So that would round to 81 years, option C.

But wait, the options include 77, which is D. Could it be that the distance is different? If the distance is, say, 150,000 ly, let's compute:

L0 = 150,000 ly.

L = 150,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 150,000 * 0.0005099 ≈76.485 ly.

t =76.485 /0.99999987 ≈76.485 *1.00000013≈76.485 + 0.000993 ≈76.486 years. So about 76.5 years. Not one of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's age, not the experienced time. Wait, the question says their average lifetime is 150 years. So if the experienced time is around 81 years, then 22 +81=103, which is less than 150, so they'd live.

So the answer would be option C) 81 years. So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation and length contraction due to their high-speed travel. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is very close to the speed of light, and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time from Earth's Frame of Reference**:  
   From Earth's perspective, the time taken to travel this distance is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Lorentz Factor (Time Dilation)**:  
   The Lorentz factor, \(\gamma\), is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]  
   For \(v = 0.99999987c\), \(v^2/c^2 \approx 0.99999974\), so:  
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}} \approx 1963.
   \]

3. **Time from Astronaut's Frame of Reference**:  
   Due to time dilation, the astronaut experiences less time. The time from the astronaut's perspective is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{astronaut}} = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1963} \approx 81.38 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Astronaut's Age Upon Arrival**:  
   The astronaut is initially 22 years old. After traveling for approximately 81 years (from their perspective), they would be:  
   \[
   22 + 81 = 103 \, \text{years old}.
   \]  
   Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they would survive the journey.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  This is incorrect because the astronaut would live to be 103 years old, well within their average lifetime.

- **Option B**: "72 years"  
  This is too low compared to the calculated value of approximately 81 years.

- **Option C**: "81 years"  
  This matches the calculated value of \(t_{\text{astronaut}} \approx 81 \, \text{years}\).

- **Option D**: "77 years"  
  This is also too low compared to the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C) 81 years**, as it aligns with the calculations for the time experienced by the astronaut. 

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation, right? Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. So the astronaut's time would experience less time compared to someone observing from Earth. Wait, but wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective.

The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long it takes them to reach Earth from their own point of view. Oh wait, but the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. So I need to calculate the time it takes from their frame of reference.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? I think it has to do with the distance and the speed. So first, I need to figure out how far the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? I think its distance is about 160,000 light-years away. Or wait, was it 170? Or maybe something else. Let me think—maybe I should look that up. Oh wait, no, I can't. I'll just proceed with what I remember.

Assuming the distance is about 163,000 light-years. The speed is 0.99999987c, which is almost c but slightly less. So, from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So, 163,000 ly / 0.99999987. Let me compute that.

Wait, 163,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Since 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. So, 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013). Let's calculate that. 163000 * 0.00000013 is about 163000 * 1.3e-7 = approximately 0.02119. So the total is about 163,000.021 years, which is almost 163,000 years. But wait, that's from Earth's perspective. But the question is from the astronaut's perspective.

Oh wait, no, from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the proper length (from Earth's frame) is L0, and the astronaut's frame sees L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the distance they experience is shorter.

Wait, so the astronaut's frame would see the distance as contracted. So distance = L0 * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v = 0.99999987c. So v squared is (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974 (since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x; but 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7, so (1-1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7). So v²/c² ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 which is about 3.16e-4. Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.09e-4.

So the contracted distance L = L0 * 5.09e-4. L0 is approximately 163,000 light-years. So L = 163,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ let's calculate that. 163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.000009 is about 1.467. So total L ≈ 81.5 + 1.467 ≈ 82.967 light-years.

Wait, so the distance they travel is about 83 light-years (approx 83 ly). At a speed of v ≈ 0.99999987c, the time experienced by the astronaut is t = L / v. So t = (82.967 ly) / 0.99999987c.

Since 1 ly at speed c is 1 year, then the time in the astronaut's frame is (82.967 / 0.99999987) years. Let's compute that.

Divide 82.967 by approximately 1 (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1). So t ≈ 82.967 years. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because 82.967 divided by 0.99999987 is about 82.967 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.967 + (82.967 * 0.00000013). Let's compute that. 82.967 * 0.00000013 is approximately 0.010785. So t ≈ 82.967 + 0.010785 ≈ 82.978 years. So approximately 83 years.

But wait, the astronaut's age is 22 years old. If it takes about 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old. But their average lifetime is 150 years, so 105 is less than that. So they would survive.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because maybe I made a mistake in the contraction factor. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for time dilation is different. Because from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the time experienced by them is (contracted distance) / speed.

Contracted distance = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163,000 ly * sqrt(1- (0.99999987)^2).

Wait, let me compute v squared again more accurately. (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x². So x is 1.3e-7, x² is 1.69e-14, which is negligible. So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1-2.6e-7. So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.6e-7. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4, so 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4 as before.

So the contraction factor is 5.09e-4, which is very small. So the contracted distance is about 83 light-years as before.

Time is then 83 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 83 years. Because 83 ly / (0.99999987c) = 83 * (1/0.99999987) years. 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, so 83 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.000108 years. So about 83 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B) 72 years.

C) 81 years.

D)77 years.

Hmm, so 83 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake in the distance?

Wait, maybe the distance is different. Wait, I thought the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. But perhaps it's closer. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. I remember that the Small Magellanic Cloud is about 200,000 light-years away, but the Large is closer, maybe like 170,000 or so? Wait, no, maybe the Large is around 160,000. So I used 163,000. Maybe that's incorrect. Maybe the actual distance is about 150,000? Or perhaps 170,000, which would change the calculation.

Wait, but regardless, let me think about the calculation again. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). With v = 0.99999987c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974. Then 1 - v²/c² is 2.6e-7.

So gamma is approximately 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Wait, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root is sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.09e-4, so 1 divided by that is about 1963. So gamma is approximately 1963.

Wait, but that's a huge gamma. So from Earth's frame, the time taken is (distance) / (v) = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.02 years.

From Earth's frame, it takes about 163,000 years. But from the astronaut's frame, the time is much less due to time dilation. The time experienced by the astronaut is t = t_earth / gamma. Wait no, wait, wait. Time experienced in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame) is t = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

But wait, t_earth is 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. So t = 163,000 / gamma. Gamma is about 1963.

So t ≈ 163,000 / 1963 ≈ let's compute this. 1963 * 80 is 157,040. 157,040 is less than 163,000. 163,000 - 157,040 = 5,960. 5,960 / 1963 ≈ about 3.03. So total approx 80 + 3 = 83.03 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options don't have 83. The closest option is C) 81 years, or D)77. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the contraction factor. Let me try another approach. The time in the astronaut's frame can be found using the formula t = (distance) / v, where distance is contracted.

Wait, because in their frame, the Earth is moving towards them at 0.99999987c, and the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So L is 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Compute that:

sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 ) = sqrt( (1 - 0.99999987)(1 + 0.99999987) ) = sqrt( (2.6e-7)(1.99999987) ) ≈ sqrt( 5.1999997e-7 ) = approx 0.000721.

Wait, wait: sqrt(5.2e-7) is approximately sqrt(5.2)*1e-3.5. sqrt(5.2) is about 2.28, and 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 2.28 *3.16e-4 ≈ 7.21e-4, so 0.000721.

So L = 163000 * 0.000721 ≈ 163000 * 7.21e-4 ≈ 163000 * 0.000721.

Calculate that: 163000 * 0.0007 = 114.1, and 163000 * 0.000021 = approximately 3.423. So total L ≈ 114.1 + 3.423 ≈ 117.523 light-years.

So time for the astronaut is t = L / v = 117.523 / 0.99999987 ≈ 117.523 * 1.00000013 ≈ 117.523 + 0.000152 ≈ 117.523 years.

Wait, that's about 118 years. But wait, that's not matching any of the options either. I must have messed up somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I should recheck the contraction factor again. Oh wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me redo the contraction factor.

Wait, 1 - v²/c² = (1 - 0.99999987)(1 + 0.99999987) ) = (0.00000013)(1.99999987 ) ≈ 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, as I computed earlier. So L = L0 * 5.099e-4.

L0 is 163,000 ly. So L = 163,000 *5.099e-4 = 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.87 ly.

So t = 82.87 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.87 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.87 + (82.87 * 0.00000013) ≈ 82.87 + 0.01077 ≈ 82.88 years.

So t is about 83 years. Again, not matching any option.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. Did I make a mistake in the actual distance? Maybe the distance isn't 163,000 ly. Let me think again. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 170,000 light-years away. Let me use 170,000 ly instead.

So L0 = 170,000 ly. Then, L = 170,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 170,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 86.7 light-years.

Then t = 86.7 / 0.99999987 ≈ 86.7 * 1.00000013 ≈ 86.7 + 0.001126 ≈ 86.701 years.

Still, that's about 86.7 years, which would push the astronaut's age to 22 + 86.7 = 108.7, which is still under 150, so they'd live. But the options don't have 86. So maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering time from the astronaut's perspective without considering the contraction. Or perhaps I should use the time from the Earth's frame and then apply time dilation. Let me try that approach.

From Earth's frame, time is t_earth = distance / speed = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

In the astronaut's frame, the time is t = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 ) ≈ 163000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.87 years.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the proper time formula, which is the time experienced by the traveler. Proper time is calculated using the Lorentz factor.

Proper time τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

Which brings me back to the same calculation. So τ ≈ 82.87 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 81 years, which is about 81. So perhaps 83 is close enough to 81? Or maybe my initial distance was wrong. If the distance is 160,000 ly instead of 163,000.

Wait, let's recalculate with 160,000 ly.

L0 = 160,000.

L = 160,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.584 light-years.

Time t = 81.584 /0.99999987 ≈81.584 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81.584 + 0.000106 ≈ 81.584 years. So approx 81.6 years. Which is about 82, but closest to option C) 81 years.

But wait, the options are 72, 81, 77, etc. So 81 is an option. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So they would reach Earth when they are 22 + 81 = 103 years old. Their average lifetime is 150, so they'd live.

So the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83, so perhaps the correct answer is C) 81.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the contraction factor.

Wait, another approach: if the speed is v=0.99999987c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) ≈ 1964. So the time in Earth frame is t_earth = 160,000 ly / v = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

The astronaut's experienced time is t = t_earth / gamma = 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 81.38 years. So that would round to 81 years, option C.

But wait, the options include 77, which is D. Could it be that the distance is different? If the distance is, say, 150,000 ly, let's compute:

L0 = 150,000 ly.

L = 150,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 150,000 * 0.0005099 ≈76.485 ly.

t =76.485 /0.99999987 ≈76.485 *1.00000013≈76.485 + 0.000993 ≈76.486 years. So about 76.5 years. Not one of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's age, not the experienced time. Wait, the question says their average lifetime is 150 years. So if the experienced time is around 81 years, then 22 +81=103, which is less than 150, so they'd live.

So the answer would be option C) 81 years. So the correct answer is C.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation and length contraction due to their high-speed travel. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is very close to the speed of light, and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time from Earth's Frame of Reference**:  
   From Earth's perspective, the time taken to travel this distance is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Lorentz Factor (Time Dilation)**:  
   The Lorentz factor, \(\gamma\), is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]  
   For \(v = 0.99999987c\), \(v^2/c^2 \approx 0.99999974\), so:  
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}} \approx 1963.
   \]

3. **Time from Astronaut's Frame of Reference**:  
   Due to time dilation, the astronaut experiences less time. The time from the astronaut's perspective is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{astronaut}} = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1963} \approx 81.38 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Astronaut's Age Upon Arrival**:  
   The astronaut is initially 22 years old. After traveling for approximately 81 years (from their perspective), they would be:  
   \[
   22 + 81 = 103 \, \text{years old}.
   \]  
   Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they would survive the journey.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  This is incorrect because the astronaut would live to be 103 years old, well within their average lifetime.

- **Option B**: "72 years"  
  This is too low compared to the calculated value of approximately 81 years.

- **Option C**: "81 years"  
  This matches the calculated value of \(t_{\text{astronaut}} \approx 81 \, \text{years}\).

- **Option D**: "77 years"  
  This is also too low compared to the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C) 81 years**, as it aligns with the calculations for the time experienced by the astronaut.
