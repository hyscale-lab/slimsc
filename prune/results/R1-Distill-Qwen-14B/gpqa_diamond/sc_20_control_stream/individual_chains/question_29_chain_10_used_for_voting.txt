Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through what's being asked.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The researchers made mutants using EMS, and they're looking at the target gene in each mutant. The changes are in the first exon area. They want to find out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, the goal is to eliminate the compound, which I assume would mean the gene product (probably a protein) isn't made or is less active. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. I think I need to look for a mutation that causes a frameshift or a premature stop codon, which would likely make the protein nonfunctional. Alternatively, a missense mutation that changes an amino acid in a critical way could also disrupt function.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the sequences are a bit long, but let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, maybe the sixth nucleotide? Let me count. Intact starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let's line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC…TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for where the sequences differ. Let's see:

Comparing each nucleotide position. In the first part, the intact gene has TTT after ATG. Mutant 1 has TCT here. Or wait, let's look again:

Wait, the sequences are a bit confusing. Let me index them.

Intact gene: positions 1-20 (simplified): ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...

So, looking at the exons, the first exon is where the changes are. So in the first exon, the intact gene has CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG. Mutant 1 has CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the mutations are. Let me compare each position in the first exon.

Wait, perhaps I can look for where each mutant differs.

Starting from the beginning:

Mutant 1:
Looking at the first part: the third codon in the intact is TTT (which is Phe). In mutant 1, is it different?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's look for nucleotides that change. The first part of the wild type is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Ah, so the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant 1, it's CTA (Leu as well? Because CTA is Leu. Hmm, same amino acid. Then the next codon in the intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant 1, it's CGC (Arg). So that's a change from Ala to Arg. That's a missense mutation. Then the next codon in the intact is GGT (Gly), while in mutant 1 it's TGG (Trp). Oh, that's a big change. Gly to Trp. Then in the next codon, the intact has ACT (Thr), but mutant 1 has TAC (Tyr). So another missense. So the first exon in mutant 1 has multiple substitutions.

But wait, how does this affect the protein? Each change would be a substitution. So the resulting protein would have different amino acids. Could any of these lead to a nonfunctional protein?

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift would cause a premature stop codon. Let's check the other mutants.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, looking at the beginning:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

So in the third codon, CTC becomes CTA (Leu to Leu). Then GCT becomes AGC (Ser). Then GGT becomes TGG (Trp). ACT becomes TAC (Tyr). So multiple changes, but no obvious frameshift.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let's compare:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Hmm, wait, the third codon is TAC in mutant3. Intact is CTC. So the third codon is CTC (Leu) in intact, but in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), while in mutant3 it's GCT (Ala). So same. Then GGT in both, then ACT in intact and mutant3. Hmm, but wait, the next part: the intact has TCTGTG, and mutant3 has TCACT? Wait, perhaps I need to look in more detail.

Wait, the mutant3 sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, perhaps there's a duplication or insertion. Wait, the change is in the first exon, so perhaps a frameshift. Let me check the lengths.

Wait, the wild type's first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write the first few nucleotides.

Intact: positions 1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT

Wait, perhaps the sixth nucleotide in the intact is C (CTC), but in mutant3 it's T (TAC). So the third codon is changed, but perhaps another change is later. Hmm, perhaps in mutant3, the sixth codon is altered and maybe there's a duplication or something else.

Wait, look at the next part. After the third codon in Mutant3, maybe there's a change in the reading frame. Let's see:

Intact: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ...TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, let's see, in the intact gene, the exons are exons 1 to 5, so the first exon is the beginning. If a mutation causes a frameshift, the reading frame changes, leading to a different amino acid sequence from that point onward, and possibly a premature stop codon.

Looking at Mutant 3, the sequence after the change is TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, perhaps the first change is in the third codon, TAC, then GCT, GCT, etc. Let me write the entire part:

Intact first exon starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, no, the length might be the same. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the number of nucleotides in the first part.

Intact: Let's say the first 24 nucleotides:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG (each codon is 3, so 9 codons here, 27 nt). Mutant3 seems to have a change somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should check the last part of the sequences for any possible stop codons. The intact ends with TGA as the stop codon. The mutants would retain that.

Alternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a stop codon early, which would truncate the protein.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So comparing:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, in the third codon, CTC becomes TAC (Leu to Tyr). Then GCT becomes ACT (Ala to Thr). Then GGT becomes TCT (Gly to Ser). So that's a shift in the amino acids.

Wait, but do any of these mutations create a stop codon earlier?

Wait, let's look for a possible nonsense mutation, which is a premature stop codon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The sequence in the first exon doesn't introduce any TAA, TAG, or TGA early. So no premature stop.

Mutant2: Similarly, the changes are substitutions but don't introduce a stop codon.

Mutant3: Let's see:

Mutant3's first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT... Looking for any possible stop codon. The first stop codon is TGA at the end. So no early stop.

Mutant4: Let's see, the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... So codons are TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), etc. No stop codon in the first part.

Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift would cause a stop codon.

Wait, frameshifts occur when the reading frame shifts, leading to a completely different sequence from the point of mutation onwards. So perhaps one of the mutants has an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, causing a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences again:

Mutant1: Let me count the nucleotides in the first part. The wild type starts with ATG (3), then TTT (3), CTC (3), GCT (3), etc. So each codon is 3 nucleotides.

Mutant1's first part: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Wait, after ATG (3), TTT (3), CTA (3), CGC (3), TGG (3), TAC (3), TTCT (which is 4 nt) Wait, hold on, that can't be right because each codon is 3. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the sequences are presented as continuous strings, so I can't rely on the way they're written. Let me instead look for any insertions or deletions.

Looking at Mutant3's sequence, I see "GTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA".

Wait, the wild type's part was "GTCTGTGGAT...", while mutant3 has "GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...". Let me see. Wild type: ...GTCTGTGGAT... Mutant3: ...GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps in mutant3, the 'GTCT' became 'GTCA' and then 'CT' is added? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a three-nucleotide change.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach.

The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein product. To eliminate it, the gene must not produce a functional protein. So, the best way is a null mutation: a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or a missense that completely disrupts function.

Looking at the options, which mutant has a mutation that would cause this.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

The first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the third codon is TAC (Y), fourth is GCT (A), fifth is ACT (T), sixth is TCT (S), seventh is GTG (V). No stop codon here.

Wait, but looking further: the intact sequence has "GGT" which is Gly, and Mutant4 has "GCT" which is Ala, but that's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mutation that changes an exon into a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is in the first exon area. So, in the first exon, the coding sequence is important. If a mutation occurs in the first exon, leading to a frameshift, the entire downstream would change, leading to a premature stop.

Looking at Mutant3 and Mutant4, perhaps these cause a frameshift.

Wait, in Mutant3, the sequence after the third codon is TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT... So, the third codon is TAC (Y), then GCT (A), GCT (A), GGT (G), GTC (V), ACT (T), etc. So each codon is intact.

In Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT ACT TCT GTG... So, third codon is TAC (Y), fourth is GCT (A), fifth is ACT (T), sixth is TCT (S), etc. Also no frameshift.

So, perhaps none of the mutants have a frameshift? Then, looking for a nonsense mutation in the first exon.

Looking again at the sequences:

Mutant1:

After the third codon (CTA) which is Leu, the next codon is CGC (Arg), then TGG (Trp), then TAC (Tyr), then TTCT? Wait, TTCT is four nucleotides, which can't be a codon. Oh! Wait, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps in reality, the sequence is written correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides. So perhaps in Mutant1, after the third codon, the next is CGC (Arg), then TGG (Trp), then TAC (Tyr), then TTCT (which is four, which can't be right). So perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant1, the sequence is ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Wait, that would make the 4th codon CGC (Arg), 5th TGG (Trp), 6th TAC (Tyr), then TTCT (which is four nucleotides), which doesn't fit. So perhaps Mutant1 has a four-bp insertion or deletion, causing a frameshift.

Wait, but the user wrote the sequences as:

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the part after ATG is TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Wait, perhaps I should look for a point where the number of nucleotides changes. Comparing to the wild type.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Looking at the 6th to 8th nucleotides: wild is GCT (Ala), mutant1 is CGC (Arg). Then wild 9-11: GGT (Gly); mutant1 is TGG (Trp). Then wild 12-14: ACT (Thr); mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Then wild 15-17: TCT (Ser); mutant1 is TTCT (four nucleotides? No, that's not possible. Maybe I'm getting the sequence wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should count the number of nucleotides in the first exon for each mutant.

In the wild type, the first exon is 25 nucleotides (just making up a number; exact count isn't given). Let's say each exon is some length, but the key is whether the number of bases changed leads to a frameshift.

But perhaps another approach: If a mutation leads to a premature stop codon before the end, that would truncate the protein.

Looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codon in the first part of the mutant sequences.

Looking at Mutant4:

The sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... So, the codons are TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), etc. No stop codon.

Mutant3: After the third codon, it's TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT. No stop codons.

Mutant2: The sequence after ATG is TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTG... So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser), then TGG (Trp), then TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant1: Looking again, after the third codon, it's CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr). No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the only option left is that a frameshift occurs, leading to a premature stop. But in the given options, none of the mutants seem to have a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation occurs in the first exon.

Wait, looking at the end of the sequences:

The wild type ends with ...CGT…TGA. So, the stop codon is at the end.

In Mutant4, the sequence is ...TCGT…TGA. So, same as wild type. So, no early stop.

Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA. Same as wild type.

Mutant2: ...TCGC…TGA. So, the last codon before stop is TCGC? Wait, no, each codon is three. So, the last part is TCG C... Wait, perhaps the stop codon is at the same place.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the mutation is a silent mutation or a missense, but doesn't eliminate the compound. So, that's not helpful.

Wait, another thought: the anti-nutritional compound is probably a toxic protein, so if the gene product is not made, the compound won't be present. So, the best way is to completely disrupt the gene's function.

Looking for a frameshift leading to a premature stop. So, which mutant has a frameshift?

Looking again:

Mutant1: Check if the number of bases is the same as wild type.

Wild type first exon: let's say 25 bases.

Mutant1: The given sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Let's count the bases in the first part.

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA... Hmm, perhaps the TTCT is four bases, which would be a problem. So, perhaps in Mutant1, there's an insertion of an extra base, causing a frameshift.

But wait, the way the sequence is written is a bit confusing. Let me count the exact number of nucleotides in the presented parts.

For the wild type: the first part is 27 nucleotides (9 codons) before the ... So, 9*3=27.

Mutant1's first part: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT... Hmm, the part before the ... is ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT. That's 10 codons (30 nt), but wait, the wild type has 9 codons. So, perhaps Mutant1 has an extra codon, meaning a three-base insertion, which would cause a frameshift.

Wait, but that would change the reading frame from that point on. So, from the insertion point onward, all codons would be different, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon somewhere.

If that's the case, Mutant1 would produce a nonfunctional protein, thus eliminating the compound.

But wait, the presented sequences don't all have the same length. For example, the wild type is ...TGA, and Mutant1 ends with ...TGA too. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the length is the same. Maybe I'm overcomplicating and should find which mutation introduces a stop codon early.

Another approach: look for any of the sequences where a stop codon appears earlier.

Looking at Mutant3:

The sequence after the third codon is TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the fifth codon in Mutant3 is GCT (Ala), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant4: The sequence is TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG, etc. No stop.

Mutant2: Sequence is CTA AGC TGG TAC TTY (wait, no, it's TAC), so codons are CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop.

So, perhaps the correct approach is that a frameshift is present in one of the mutants, causing a premature stop. Which mutant shows a frameshift?

Looking again:

Only Mutant3 and Mutant4 have changes that could be frameshifts.

Wait, perhaps Mutant3 has a duplication or deletion. Let me see:

The wild type has after the third codon: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3 has: TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the fourth codon in wild type is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant3 it's GCT (Ala). So, same. Then GGT (Gly) in wild, and GGT (Gly) in Mutant3. So same. Then ACT (Thr) in wild, and GTC (Val) in Mutant3. So, this is a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option presents.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would require the gene product to be nonfunctional. The best way is a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or a nonsense mutation.

Looking at the options, only Mutant4 has a change that removes a part of the exon, perhaps leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking at Mutant4: The sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, perhaps the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the wild type had TCT after ACT. So, in Mutant4, TCT is replaced by ACT. That's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4 is missing a nucleotide, causing a frameshift. Let me count the number of nucleotides in the first part.

Wild type first exon: say the initial part is 27 nt.

Mutant4: Let's count the number of nt in the first part.

Mutant4 sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Each codon is 3, so that's 9 codons (27 nt). So, same length as wild type. No frameshift.

Hmm. Then, perhaps the answer is none of these, but that can't be. So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a large deletion in the first exon, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The wild type's initial part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the wild type after ATG TTT has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: after ATG TTT, it's TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC, in mutant4 it's TAC (change). Then wild has GCT, mutant4 has GCT. Then wild has GGT, mutant4 has ACT. Then wild has TCT, mutant4 has TCT.

So, in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC, the fourth is GCT, fifth is ACT, sixth is TCT.

Wait, that's a substitution in the third codon and fifth codon.

So, the amino acids after the third position would be different.

But how would that affect the protein? Let's think about the reading frame.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT instead of GCT (Ala to Thr). That's a substitution, not a frameshift.

So, perhaps none of the options cause a frameshift. Then, the only way is to look for a missense mutation that disrupts function.

But that's less likely to completely eliminate the compound. Alternatively, perhaps a mutation in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a nonsense mutation in the first exon.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, in the middle, perhaps the 'GTCACTTCT' part. Let me look for a possible stop codon.

Wait, the sequence is ...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, looking for TGA, which is the stop codon. The stop is at the end, so no early stops.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the start codon. But all the mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is intact.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option's effect would be.

If a frameshift occurs, the entire downstream codons are altered, which could lead to a completely different amino acid sequence and a premature stop. So, which mutant has a frameshift?

Looking at Mutant3, the sequence after the first few codons is different, but I don't see a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps Mutant3 has an extra nucleotide, shifting the frame. Let me count the letters.

Wild type first part is 27 nt: 9 codons.

Mutant3's first part: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

That's 10 codons (30 nt). So, one more codon than wild type. So, a three-base insertion would cause a frameshift.

Wait, but the sequences presented are a bit unclear. How many nucleotides are in the first part of each mutant?

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ... TGA.

Let me count the letters: ATG is 3, then TTT (3), CTC (3), GCT (3), GGT (3), ACT (3), TCT (3), GTG (3), GAT (3), GAA (3), CAA (3), TAT (3), TTA (3), TTG (3), TCG (3), T ... So that's 15 codons (45 nt) before the ... So, the first exon is longer than I thought.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC ... TGA.

Wait, the part after TTCT is GTG, so that's 3. So, the first part is 16 codons (48 nt) in mutant1, compared to wild type's 15. So, mutant1 has an extra codon, hence a frameshift. This would change all downstream codons, leading to a premature stop.

If that's the case, mutant1 would produce a nonfunctional protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

So, the correct answer would be Mutant1, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This could occur through a frameshift mutation (causing a premature stop codon) or a missense/nonsense mutation that significantly alters the protein's structure or function. The analysis of each mutant is as follows:

### Intact Gene:
The intact gene sequence is provided as a continuous stretch of nucleotides, with the start codon (ATG) and stop codon (TGA) intact. The first exon contains several codons that are critical for the gene's function.

### Mutant 1:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
- Comparison to the intact gene reveals substitutions in several codons (e.g., CTC → CTA, GCT → CGC, GGT → TGG, ACT → TAC). Notably, the sequence appears to have an extra nucleotide, causing a frameshift. This frameshift alters the reading frame from that point onward, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon. This would result in a nonfunctional protein.

### Mutant 2:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
- Substitutions are observed in several codons (e.g., CTC → CTA, GCT → AGC, GGT → TGG, ACT → TAC). However, the reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced. This mutation is less likely to completely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

### Mutant 3:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
- Substitutions occur in several codons (e.g., CTC → TAC, GCT → GCT, GGT → GTC, ACT → ACT). The reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced. While some amino acids are altered, the protein is unlikely to be rendered completely nonfunctional.

### Mutant 4:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
- Substitutions are observed in several codons (e.g., CTC → TAC, GCT → ACT, GGT → TCT). The reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced. Similar to Mutant 3, the protein is unlikely to be completely nonfunctional.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, Mutant 1 introduces a frameshift mutation, which disrupts the reading frame and likely results in a premature stop codon. This would render the protein nonfunctional and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. None of the other mutants introduce a frameshift or a premature stop codon, making them less likely to achieve the desired outcome.

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through what's being asked.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The researchers made mutants using EMS, and they're looking at the target gene in each mutant. The changes are in the first exon area. They want to find out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, the goal is to eliminate the compound, which I assume would mean the gene product (probably a protein) isn't made or is less active. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. I think I need to look for a mutation that causes a frameshift or a premature stop codon, which would likely make the protein nonfunctional. Alternatively, a missense mutation that changes an amino acid in a critical way could also disrupt function.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the sequences are a bit long, but let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, maybe the sixth nucleotide? Let me count. Intact starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let's line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC…TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for where the sequences differ. Let's see:

Comparing each nucleotide position. In the first part, the intact gene has TTT after ATG. Mutant 1 has TCT here. Or wait, let's look again:

Wait, the sequences are a bit confusing. Let me index them.

Intact gene: positions 1-20 (simplified): ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...

So, looking at the exons, the first exon is where the changes are. So in the first exon, the intact gene has CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG. Mutant 1 has CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the mutations are. Let me compare each position in the first exon.

Wait, perhaps I can look for where each mutant differs.

Starting from the beginning:

Mutant 1:
Looking at the first part: the third codon in the intact is TTT (which is Phe). In mutant 1, is it different?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's look for nucleotides that change. The first part of the wild type is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Ah, so the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant 1, it's CTA (Leu as well? Because CTA is Leu. Hmm, same amino acid. Then the next codon in the intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant 1, it's CGC (Arg). So that's a change from Ala to Arg. That's a missense mutation. Then the next codon in the intact is GGT (Gly), while in mutant 1 it's TGG (Trp). Oh, that's a big change. Gly to Trp. Then in the next codon, the intact has ACT (Thr), but mutant 1 has TAC (Tyr). So another missense. So the first exon in mutant 1 has multiple substitutions.

But wait, how does this affect the protein? Each change would be a substitution. So the resulting protein would have different amino acids. Could any of these lead to a nonfunctional protein?

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift would cause a premature stop codon. Let's check the other mutants.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, looking at the beginning:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

So in the third codon, CTC becomes CTA (Leu to Leu). Then GCT becomes AGC (Ser). Then GGT becomes TGG (Trp). ACT becomes TAC (Tyr). So multiple changes, but no obvious frameshift.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let's compare:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Hmm, wait, the third codon is TAC in mutant3. Intact is CTC. So the third codon is CTC (Leu) in intact, but in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), while in mutant3 it's GCT (Ala). So same. Then GGT in both, then ACT in intact and mutant3. Hmm, but wait, the next part: the intact has TCTGTG, and mutant3 has TCACT? Wait, perhaps I need to look in more detail.

Wait, the mutant3 sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, perhaps there's a duplication or insertion. Wait, the change is in the first exon, so perhaps a frameshift. Let me check the lengths.

Wait, the wild type's first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write the first few nucleotides.

Intact: positions 1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT

Wait, perhaps the sixth nucleotide in the intact is C (CTC), but in mutant3 it's T (TAC). So the third codon is changed, but perhaps another change is later. Hmm, perhaps in mutant3, the sixth codon is altered and maybe there's a duplication or something else.

Wait, look at the next part. After the third codon in Mutant3, maybe there's a change in the reading frame. Let's see:

Intact: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ...TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, let's see, in the intact gene, the exons are exons 1 to 5, so the first exon is the beginning. If a mutation causes a frameshift, the reading frame changes, leading to a different amino acid sequence from that point onward, and possibly a premature stop codon.

Looking at Mutant 3, the sequence after the change is TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, perhaps the first change is in the third codon, TAC, then GCT, GCT, etc. Let me write the entire part:

Intact first exon starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, no, the length might be the same. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the number of nucleotides in the first part.

Intact: Let's say the first 24 nucleotides:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG (each codon is 3, so 9 codons here, 27 nt). Mutant3 seems to have a change somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should check the last part of the sequences for any possible stop codons. The intact ends with TGA as the stop codon. The mutants would retain that.

Alternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a stop codon early, which would truncate the protein.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So comparing:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, in the third codon, CTC becomes TAC (Leu to Tyr). Then GCT becomes ACT (Ala to Thr). Then GGT becomes TCT (Gly to Ser). So that's a shift in the amino acids.

Wait, but do any of these mutations create a stop codon earlier?

Wait, let's look for a possible nonsense mutation, which is a premature stop codon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The sequence in the first exon doesn't introduce any TAA, TAG, or TGA early. So no premature stop.

Mutant2: Similarly, the changes are substitutions but don't introduce a stop codon.

Mutant3: Let's see:

Mutant3's first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT... Looking for any possible stop codon. The first stop codon is TGA at the end. So no early stop.

Mutant4: Let's see, the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... So codons are TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), etc. No stop codon in the first part.

Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift would cause a stop codon.

Wait, frameshifts occur when the reading frame shifts, leading to a completely different sequence from the point of mutation onwards. So perhaps one of the mutants has an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, causing a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences again:

Mutant1: Let me count the nucleotides in the first part. The wild type starts with ATG (3), then TTT (3), CTC (3), GCT (3), etc. So each codon is 3 nucleotides.

Mutant1's first part: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Wait, after ATG (3), TTT (3), CTA (3), CGC (3), TGG (3), TAC (3), TTCT (which is 4 nt) Wait, hold on, that can't be right because each codon is 3. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the sequences are presented as continuous strings, so I can't rely on the way they're written. Let me instead look for any insertions or deletions.

Looking at Mutant3's sequence, I see "GTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA".

Wait, the wild type's part was "GTCTGTGGAT...", while mutant3 has "GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...". Let me see. Wild type: ...GTCTGTGGAT... Mutant3: ...GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps in mutant3, the 'GTCT' became 'GTCA' and then 'CT' is added? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a three-nucleotide change.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach.

The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein product. To eliminate it, the gene must not produce a functional protein. So, the best way is a null mutation: a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or a missense that completely disrupts function.

Looking at the options, which mutant has a mutation that would cause this.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

The first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the third codon is TAC (Y), fourth is GCT (A), fifth is ACT (T), sixth is TCT (S), seventh is GTG (V). No stop codon here.

Wait, but looking further: the intact sequence has "GGT" which is Gly, and Mutant4 has "GCT" which is Ala, but that's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mutation that changes an exon into a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is in the first exon area. So, in the first exon, the coding sequence is important. If a mutation occurs in the first exon, leading to a frameshift, the entire downstream would change, leading to a premature stop.

Looking at Mutant3 and Mutant4, perhaps these cause a frameshift.

Wait, in Mutant3, the sequence after the third codon is TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT... So, the third codon is TAC (Y), then GCT (A), GCT (A), GGT (G), GTC (V), ACT (T), etc. So each codon is intact.

In Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT ACT TCT GTG... So, third codon is TAC (Y), fourth is GCT (A), fifth is ACT (T), sixth is TCT (S), etc. Also no frameshift.

So, perhaps none of the mutants have a frameshift? Then, looking for a nonsense mutation in the first exon.

Looking again at the sequences:

Mutant1:

After the third codon (CTA) which is Leu, the next codon is CGC (Arg), then TGG (Trp), then TAC (Tyr), then TTCT? Wait, TTCT is four nucleotides, which can't be a codon. Oh! Wait, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps in reality, the sequence is written correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides. So perhaps in Mutant1, after the third codon, the next is CGC (Arg), then TGG (Trp), then TAC (Tyr), then TTCT (which is four, which can't be right). So perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant1, the sequence is ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Wait, that would make the 4th codon CGC (Arg), 5th TGG (Trp), 6th TAC (Tyr), then TTCT (which is four nucleotides), which doesn't fit. So perhaps Mutant1 has a four-bp insertion or deletion, causing a frameshift.

Wait, but the user wrote the sequences as:

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the part after ATG is TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Wait, perhaps I should look for a point where the number of nucleotides changes. Comparing to the wild type.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Looking at the 6th to 8th nucleotides: wild is GCT (Ala), mutant1 is CGC (Arg). Then wild 9-11: GGT (Gly); mutant1 is TGG (Trp). Then wild 12-14: ACT (Thr); mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Then wild 15-17: TCT (Ser); mutant1 is TTCT (four nucleotides? No, that's not possible. Maybe I'm getting the sequence wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should count the number of nucleotides in the first exon for each mutant.

In the wild type, the first exon is 25 nucleotides (just making up a number; exact count isn't given). Let's say each exon is some length, but the key is whether the number of bases changed leads to a frameshift.

But perhaps another approach: If a mutation leads to a premature stop codon before the end, that would truncate the protein.

Looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codon in the first part of the mutant sequences.

Looking at Mutant4:

The sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... So, the codons are TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), etc. No stop codon.

Mutant3: After the third codon, it's TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT. No stop codons.

Mutant2: The sequence after ATG is TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTG... So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser), then TGG (Trp), then TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant1: Looking again, after the third codon, it's CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr). No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the only option left is that a frameshift occurs, leading to a premature stop. But in the given options, none of the mutants seem to have a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation occurs in the first exon.

Wait, looking at the end of the sequences:

The wild type ends with ...CGT…TGA. So, the stop codon is at the end.

In Mutant4, the sequence is ...TCGT…TGA. So, same as wild type. So, no early stop.

Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA. Same as wild type.

Mutant2: ...TCGC…TGA. So, the last codon before stop is TCGC? Wait, no, each codon is three. So, the last part is TCG C... Wait, perhaps the stop codon is at the same place.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the mutation is a silent mutation or a missense, but doesn't eliminate the compound. So, that's not helpful.

Wait, another thought: the anti-nutritional compound is probably a toxic protein, so if the gene product is not made, the compound won't be present. So, the best way is to completely disrupt the gene's function.

Looking for a frameshift leading to a premature stop. So, which mutant has a frameshift?

Looking again:

Mutant1: Check if the number of bases is the same as wild type.

Wild type first exon: let's say 25 bases.

Mutant1: The given sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Let's count the bases in the first part.

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA... Hmm, perhaps the TTCT is four bases, which would be a problem. So, perhaps in Mutant1, there's an insertion of an extra base, causing a frameshift.

But wait, the way the sequence is written is a bit confusing. Let me count the exact number of nucleotides in the presented parts.

For the wild type: the first part is 27 nucleotides (9 codons) before the ... So, 9*3=27.

Mutant1's first part: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT... Hmm, the part before the ... is ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT. That's 10 codons (30 nt), but wait, the wild type has 9 codons. So, perhaps Mutant1 has an extra codon, meaning a three-base insertion, which would cause a frameshift.

Wait, but that would change the reading frame from that point on. So, from the insertion point onward, all codons would be different, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon somewhere.

If that's the case, Mutant1 would produce a nonfunctional protein, thus eliminating the compound.

But wait, the presented sequences don't all have the same length. For example, the wild type is ...TGA, and Mutant1 ends with ...TGA too. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the length is the same. Maybe I'm overcomplicating and should find which mutation introduces a stop codon early.

Another approach: look for any of the sequences where a stop codon appears earlier.

Looking at Mutant3:

The sequence after the third codon is TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the fifth codon in Mutant3 is GCT (Ala), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant4: The sequence is TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG, etc. No stop.

Mutant2: Sequence is CTA AGC TGG TAC TTY (wait, no, it's TAC), so codons are CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop.

So, perhaps the correct approach is that a frameshift is present in one of the mutants, causing a premature stop. Which mutant shows a frameshift?

Looking again:

Only Mutant3 and Mutant4 have changes that could be frameshifts.

Wait, perhaps Mutant3 has a duplication or deletion. Let me see:

The wild type has after the third codon: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3 has: TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the fourth codon in wild type is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant3 it's GCT (Ala). So, same. Then GGT (Gly) in wild, and GGT (Gly) in Mutant3. So same. Then ACT (Thr) in wild, and GTC (Val) in Mutant3. So, this is a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option presents.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would require the gene product to be nonfunctional. The best way is a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or a nonsense mutation.

Looking at the options, only Mutant4 has a change that removes a part of the exon, perhaps leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking at Mutant4: The sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, perhaps the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the wild type had TCT after ACT. So, in Mutant4, TCT is replaced by ACT. That's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4 is missing a nucleotide, causing a frameshift. Let me count the number of nucleotides in the first part.

Wild type first exon: say the initial part is 27 nt.

Mutant4: Let's count the number of nt in the first part.

Mutant4 sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Each codon is 3, so that's 9 codons (27 nt). So, same length as wild type. No frameshift.

Hmm. Then, perhaps the answer is none of these, but that can't be. So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a large deletion in the first exon, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The wild type's initial part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the wild type after ATG TTT has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: after ATG TTT, it's TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC, in mutant4 it's TAC (change). Then wild has GCT, mutant4 has GCT. Then wild has GGT, mutant4 has ACT. Then wild has TCT, mutant4 has TCT.

So, in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC, the fourth is GCT, fifth is ACT, sixth is TCT.

Wait, that's a substitution in the third codon and fifth codon.

So, the amino acids after the third position would be different.

But how would that affect the protein? Let's think about the reading frame.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT instead of GCT (Ala to Thr). That's a substitution, not a frameshift.

So, perhaps none of the options cause a frameshift. Then, the only way is to look for a missense mutation that disrupts function.

But that's less likely to completely eliminate the compound. Alternatively, perhaps a mutation in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a nonsense mutation in the first exon.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant3's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, in the middle, perhaps the 'GTCACTTCT' part. Let me look for a possible stop codon.

Wait, the sequence is ...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, looking for TGA, which is the stop codon. The stop is at the end, so no early stops.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the start codon. But all the mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is intact.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option's effect would be.

If a frameshift occurs, the entire downstream codons are altered, which could lead to a completely different amino acid sequence and a premature stop. So, which mutant has a frameshift?

Looking at Mutant3, the sequence after the first few codons is different, but I don't see a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps Mutant3 has an extra nucleotide, shifting the frame. Let me count the letters.

Wild type first part is 27 nt: 9 codons.

Mutant3's first part: ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

That's 10 codons (30 nt). So, one more codon than wild type. So, a three-base insertion would cause a frameshift.

Wait, but the sequences presented are a bit unclear. How many nucleotides are in the first part of each mutant?

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ... TGA.

Let me count the letters: ATG is 3, then TTT (3), CTC (3), GCT (3), GGT (3), ACT (3), TCT (3), GTG (3), GAT (3), GAA (3), CAA (3), TAT (3), TTA (3), TTG (3), TCG (3), T ... So that's 15 codons (45 nt) before the ... So, the first exon is longer than I thought.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC ... TGA.

Wait, the part after TTCT is GTG, so that's 3. So, the first part is 16 codons (48 nt) in mutant1, compared to wild type's 15. So, mutant1 has an extra codon, hence a frameshift. This would change all downstream codons, leading to a premature stop.

If that's the case, mutant1 would produce a nonfunctional protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

So, the correct answer would be Mutant1, which is option C.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This could occur through a frameshift mutation (causing a premature stop codon) or a missense/nonsense mutation that significantly alters the protein's structure or function. The analysis of each mutant is as follows:

### Intact Gene:
The intact gene sequence is provided as a continuous stretch of nucleotides, with the start codon (ATG) and stop codon (TGA) intact. The first exon contains several codons that are critical for the gene's function.

### Mutant 1:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
- Comparison to the intact gene reveals substitutions in several codons (e.g., CTC → CTA, GCT → CGC, GGT → TGG, ACT → TAC). Notably, the sequence appears to have an extra nucleotide, causing a frameshift. This frameshift alters the reading frame from that point onward, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon. This would result in a nonfunctional protein.

### Mutant 2:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
- Substitutions are observed in several codons (e.g., CTC → CTA, GCT → AGC, GGT → TGG, ACT → TAC). However, the reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced. This mutation is less likely to completely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

### Mutant 3:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
- Substitutions occur in several codons (e.g., CTC → TAC, GCT → GCT, GGT → GTC, ACT → ACT). The reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced. While some amino acids are altered, the protein is unlikely to be rendered completely nonfunctional.

### Mutant 4:
- Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
- Substitutions are observed in several codons (e.g., CTC → TAC, GCT → ACT, GGT → TCT). The reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced. Similar to Mutant 3, the protein is unlikely to be completely nonfunctional.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, Mutant 1 introduces a frameshift mutation, which disrupts the reading frame and likely results in a premature stop codon. This would render the protein nonfunctional and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. None of the other mutants introduce a frameshift or a premature stop codon, making them less likely to achieve the desired outcome.

**Answer: C**
