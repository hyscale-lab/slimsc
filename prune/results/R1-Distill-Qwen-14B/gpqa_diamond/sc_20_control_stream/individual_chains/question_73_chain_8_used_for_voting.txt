Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, the question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, first, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. The options are about their relative speed and total energy.

Wait, so the first part is about the relative speed. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but actually, wait. Both are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of one astronaut, what's the velocity of the other? Let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, actually, no. Wait, the formula is v_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, in which direction? Because if A is moving faster than B in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So let me plug in the numbers.

v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.143c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and D also 0.14c. So either C or D is possible for the relative speed. So I'll need to compute the energies to figure out which option is correct.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Since these are relativistic speeds, I can't just use E=1/2 mv². Instead, I need to use the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So for each astronaut, I'll calculate their individual energies and then add them up.

First astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c). Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c). Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 is about 1.1547. Then E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc². So our calculation gives E≈5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25, \quad E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547, \quad E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and the total energy \(E = 5.96m c^2\) match option C.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, the question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.143c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and D also 0.14c. So either C or D is possible for the relative speed. So I'll need to compute the energies to figure out which option is correct.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Since these are relativistic speeds, I can't just use E=1/2 mv². Instead, I need to use the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So for each astronaut, I'll calculate their individual energies and then add them up.

First astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c). Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c). Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 is about 1.1547. Then E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc². So our calculation gives E≈5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25, \quad E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547, \quad E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and the total energy \(E = 5.96m c^2\) match option C.
