Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, so the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection method used is the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The problem gives the maximum shifts for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I recall is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 year / P)^(1/3) )). But wait, since the planets' masses are much less than the stars', M_star + M_planet is approximately M_star. And since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), that part cancels out when comparing the two planets.

Wait, but more accurately, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c * P) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

But since both planets are around stars of the same mass, and assuming sin i is the same (maybe they're edge-on, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's a safe assumption), then K is proportional to (M_p / P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune. Oh, wait, the problem says their masses are similar, so M_p is the same for both. So K1/K2 would be (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, no, let me think again. Rearranging the formula, since K is proportional to M_p / (P^(1/3)), and M_p is the same for both, then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), and K2 to 1/P2^(1/3). So K1 = (constant) * 1/(P1)^(1/3), K2 = (constant) *1/(P2)^(1/3). Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Alternatively, if I rearrange that formula:

K = ( (G * M_p) / (c) )^(1/3) * (1/( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (G M_p / c )^(1/3) * (1/( M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) )

Which simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p )/(c M_star) )^(1/3) * ( 1/(P) )^(1/3) )

Since G, c, M_p, and M_star are the same for both cases (same star, same planet mass), K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3), where k is a constant.

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that's the same as before. So if I take the ratio of K1 to K2, I get (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7. So K1 is smaller than K2.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So, 0.714 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, cube both sides: (0.714)^3 ≈ (0.5) or something.

Wait, let's compute 0.714 cubed. Let's see. 0.7^3 is 0.343. But 0.714 is a bit more, maybe around 0.364.

Wait, but wait, 0.714^3 is approximately 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.51, then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Which means P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1 by a factor of ~0.36. Alternatively, the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet 2 compared to planet 1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the period of planet 2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long.

Wait, the question is asking "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So that would be like 1/ (0.36) = approx 2.77 times shorter, but the question is about how much longer. So the answer would be P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning it's shorter. So the ratio is approximately 0.36, which would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Because I may have mixed up the formula.

Wait, K is velocity semiamplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet and the period. Since K is larger when the star moves more because of a closer planet or a more massive planet. But in this case, the planet masses are similar, so the larger K would imply a shorter period.

Because for the same planet mass, a shorter period would mean the star is moving more rapidly (since the planet is closer, so the orbital speed is higher). So a larger K implies shorter period.

So, in our problem, Planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), so Planet #2 has a shorter period. So P2 is less than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, because earlier I had K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So K1=5, K2=7.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the orbital period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So it's shorter, not longer. Therefore, the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since it's shorter, the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So if the question is how much longer is P2 than P1, the answer is 0.36 times as long, so it's not longer—it's shorter.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, the answer would be 0.36, which is option A. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter by that factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the ratio the other way around. Let me think again.

We have K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So if K1 is smaller than K2, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) < 1. So P2/P1 < 1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Which is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's not longer, but shorter. So the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? That would be 0.36 times as long, so the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.

Alternatively, maybe I should have taken the inverse ratio. Let me think again.

Wait, if P is the period, and K is the velocity semi-amplitude, the relation is K proportional to (M_p / (M_star)) * (1/(P)^(1/3)).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to remember more accurately.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / (c) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2π/(c P)) ) / (M_star^(2/3))

Which can be rewritten as:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(c M_star^(2/3))) ) * (1/P^(1/3))

So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)).

But since M_p is same for both planets, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1).

Which is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times the period of P1. So P2 is shorter, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1.

But the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's about 0.36 times as long, meaning it's not longer—it's shorter. So the period of P2 is shorter, so the answer is 0.36 times as long. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait, another approach: because velocity shift is related to the movement of the star. The star's velocity is determined by the planet's mass and the orbital period. So, a larger velocity shift (K) would imply a shorter period because the star is moving more rapidly, which would happen if the planet is in a tighter orbit (shorter period). So Planet #2, with a larger K (7 vs 5), has a shorter period than Planet #1.

Thus, the period ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets have similar masses to Neptune and are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), assuming the stars and planets have similar masses.

For Planet #1, the maximum velocity shift is \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for Planet #2, it is \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Since \( K_1/K_2 = (P_2/P_1)^{1/3} \), we can solve for the period ratio:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2/P_1 \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long.

The correct option is:

**A) ~0.36**

Planet #1 has a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I recall is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 year / P)^(1/3) )). But wait, since the planets' masses are much less than the stars', M_star + M_planet is approximately M_star. And since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), that part cancels out when comparing the two planets.

Wait, but more accurately, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c * P) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

But since both planets are around stars of the same mass, and assuming sin i is the same (maybe they're edge-on, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's a safe assumption), then K is proportional to (M_p / P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune. Oh, wait, the problem says their masses are similar, so M_p is the same for both. So K1/K2 would be (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, no, let me think again. Rearranging the formula, since K is proportional to M_p / (P^(1/3)), and M_p is the same for both, then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), and K2 to 1/P2^(1/3). So K1 = (constant) * 1/(P1)^(1/3), K2 = (constant) *1/(P2)^(1/3). Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Alternatively, if I rearrange that formula:

K = ( (G * M_p) / (c) )^(1/3) * (1/( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (G M_p / c )^(1/3) * (1/( M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) )

Which simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p )/(c M_star) )^(1/3) * ( 1/(P) )^(1/3) )

Since G, c, M_p, and M_star are the same for both cases (same star, same planet mass), K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3), where k is a constant.

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that's the same as before. So if I take the ratio of K1 to K2, I get (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7. So K1 is smaller than K2.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So, 0.714 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, cube both sides: (0.714)^3 ≈ (0.5) or something.

Wait, let's compute 0.714 cubed. Let's see. 0.7^3 is 0.343. But 0.714 is a bit more, maybe around 0.364.

Wait, but wait, 0.714^3 is approximately 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.51, then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Which means P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1 by a factor of ~0.36. Alternatively, the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet 2 compared to planet 1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the period of planet 2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long.

Wait, the question is asking "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So that would be like 1/ (0.36) = approx 2.77 times shorter, but the question is about how much longer. So the answer would be P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning it's shorter. So the ratio is approximately 0.36, which would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Because I may have mixed up the formula.

Wait, K is velocity semiamplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet and the period. Since K is larger when the star moves more because of a closer planet or a more massive planet. But in this case, the planet masses are similar, so the larger K would imply a shorter period.

Because for the same planet mass, a shorter period would mean the star is moving more rapidly (since the planet is closer, so the orbital speed is higher). So a larger K implies shorter period.

So, in our problem, Planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), so Planet #2 has a shorter period. So P2 is less than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, because earlier I had K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So K1=5, K2=7.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the orbital period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So it's shorter, not longer. Therefore, the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since it's shorter, the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So if the question is how much longer is P2 than P1, the answer is 0.36 times as long, so it's not longer—it's shorter.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, the answer would be 0.36, which is option A. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter by that factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the ratio the other way around. Let me think again.

We have K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So if K1 is smaller than K2, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) < 1. So P2/P1 < 1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Which is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's not longer, but shorter. So the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? That would be 0.36 times as long, so the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.

Alternatively, maybe I should have taken the inverse ratio. Let me think again.

Wait, if P is the period, and K is the velocity semi-amplitude, the relation is K proportional to (M_p / (M_star)) * (1/(P)^(1/3)).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to remember more accurately.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / (c) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) * (2π/(c P)) ) / (M_star^(2/3))

Which can be rewritten as:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(c M_star^(2/3))) ) * (1/P^(1/3))

So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)).

But since M_p is same for both planets, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1).

Which is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times the period of P1. So P2 is shorter, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1.

But the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's about 0.36 times as long, meaning it's not longer—it's shorter. So the period of P2 is shorter, so the answer is 0.36 times as long. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait, another approach: because velocity shift is related to the movement of the star. The star's velocity is determined by the planet's mass and the orbital period. So, a larger velocity shift (K) would imply a shorter period because the star is moving more rapidly, which would happen if the planet is in a tighter orbit (shorter period). So Planet #2, with a larger K (7 vs 5), has a shorter period than Planet #1.

Thus, the period ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets have similar masses to Neptune and are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), assuming the stars and planets have similar masses.

For Planet #1, the maximum velocity shift is \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for Planet #2, it is \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Since \( K_1/K_2 = (P_2/P_1)^{1/3} \), we can solve for the period ratio:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2/P_1 \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long.

The correct option is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
