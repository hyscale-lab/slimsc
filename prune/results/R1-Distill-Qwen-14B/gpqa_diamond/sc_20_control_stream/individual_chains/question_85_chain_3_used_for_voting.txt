Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, the formula is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/ (1 + epsilon) )^0.25, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, so it's proportional to the star's luminosity and inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance squared, but wait, let me get this straight.

The formula I think is Te = ( (L * (1 - A)) / (16 * π * σ * a²) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the orbital distance. But since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the A term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures should depend on the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, but how do I get their distances from the star? The question gives data from transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method gives the radius of the planet, which affects the depth of the transit. The radial velocity gives the mass of the planet, based on the Doppler shift.

But for calculating equilibrium temperature, the main factors are the planet's distance from the star and the star's characteristics. Since both stars are detected using both methods, their orbital periods can be found, but the question doesn't give their orbital periods. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can find the relation between the two planets' semi-major axes (distances) from the given RV data.

The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis. The RV shift is proportional to (M_planet * sin(i)) / (M_star), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are in circular orbits, and we're using the RV method, perhaps the semi-major axis can be found from the RV data. But I'm not exactly sure how.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity, which is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/ (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )... Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, the question doesn't mention inclination, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that sin i is 1, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to get RV measurements (i=90 degrees, edge-on). So sin i = 1.

Wait, but the actual formula I remember is K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift given for each planet. The question states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. So the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift, right? Because the semi-amplitude is the maximum velocity measured, which for the same star, is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/3)), or something like that.

Wait, another approach. The RV shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass, but the star's velocity is much smaller, so the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/ something? Hmm, maybe better to use the simplified version.

Another way: The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) = (28.4 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (P / yr) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_star + M_p) / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) / (1 - e² )^(1/2 )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the relation between the Doppler shifts and the semi-major axes. Since both planets are detected via RV, their K values are given. The higher K means the star is moving more due to the planet's gravitational pull. So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^alpha a^beta)), where alpha and beta are exponents. Let me see.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward relationship between K and the planet's parameters.

Wait, here's a formula I found in notes: K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (P c ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But since e=0, that term is 1. Also, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / (c^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Hmm. So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

But how do I relate this to the semi-major axis a? Because the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law. So Kepler's law says:

P² = (4 pi² a³) / ( G (M_star + M_p) )

Again, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so P² ≈ (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star )

So a³ = ( G M_star P² ) / (4 pi² )

So a = [ ( G M_star P² ) / (4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

Hmm, but substituting that into the K equation would complicate things. Alternatively, from the K expression, since K is proportional to (M_p)/(M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)), and from Kepler's law, a is proportional to ( M_star P² )^(1/3 )

So, a ∝ M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3 )

Wait, so if I have two planets, say 1 and 2, their K1 and K2 are given. So K1/K2 = [ (M1 sin i1 ) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M2 sin i2 ) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

The M_star and sin i terms can be approximated as same for both (since same star and same inclination, presumably), so K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

Hmm, but without knowing P1 and P2, how can I find the ratio of a1 and a2?

Wait, but the transit method gives the planet's radius, but that's for the transit depth. It doesn't directly give the distance, but combined with the RV data, perhaps we can get the period. Oh! Because the transit method gives the period as the time between transits, which is the orbital period. So the periods are known. But wait, the question doesn't give the periods. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that both planets are detected using both methods. So, for each planet, their periods can be found from the transit timing. But the question doesn't provide the periods, so maybe we can't proceed that way. Hmm, perhaps the key is that the Doppler shifts (K values) are inversely proportional to the semi-major axes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes. Since Te is proportional to (L / a² )^0.25, and L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, the star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R_star² sigma Teff^4. So L is proportional to R_star² Teff^4. The star has R = 1.2 Rsun and Teff = 6300 K. The Sun has Teff about 5778 K. But I'm not sure if that's necessary because both planets orbit the same star, so when taking the ratio, the L terms will cancel.

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures Te1/Te2 is sqrt( ( a2 / a1 ) ) * ( (L1/(16 pi sigma a1² (1-A)))^0.25 ) / ( (L2/(16 pi sigma a2² (1-A)))^0.25 )

Wait, but L1 and L2 are the same because it's the same star. So the ratio becomes (a2/a1)^(1/4) * ( (1/(a1²)) / (1/(a2²)) )^(1/4 ) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The equilibrium temperature formula is: 

Te = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^0.25

So, when taking the ratio Te1/Te2, it becomes [ (L (1-A)) / (16 pi sigma a1²) )^0.25 ] / [ (L (1-A)) / (16 pi sigma a2²) )^0.25 ]

Simplifying, ( (a2²)/(a1²) )^0.25 = (a2/a1)^(0.5) = sqrt(a2/a1).

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Thus, if I can find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root to get the temperature ratio.

So the key is to find a1 and a2, or a2/a1.

But how?

From the RV data, we have K1 and K2. The semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period (and hence semi-major axis).

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) / (c ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But Kepler's third law says P² = (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star )

So P = [ (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi² a³ ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it step by step.

Express P in terms of a:

P = ( (4 pi² a³)/(G M_star) )^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

So 1/P^(1/3) = [ (G M_star )/(4 pi² a³) ) ]^(1/6 )

Now plug into K:

K ≈ (27 pi G )^(1/3) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * [ (G M_star )/(4 pi² a³ ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Let me simplify each term.

27 pi G = 3^3 pi G, so (27 pi G )^(1/3) = 3 (pi G )^(1/3 )

So,

K ≈ [3 (pi G )^(1/3) / c ] * [ M_p / M_star^(2/3) ] * [ ( G M_star )^(1/6) / (4 pi² a³ )^(1/6) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/2)
M_star^(-2/3) * M_star^(1/6) = M_star^(-1/2 )
a^(-3*(1/6)) = a^(-1/2 )

So,

K ≈ [3 (pi )^(1/3) G^(1/3) / c ] * M_p * ( G^(1/2) M_star^(-1/2) ) / (4^(1/6) (pi^2)^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) )

Combine the constants:

pi^(1/3) / (4^(1/6) (pi^2)^(1/6) ) ) = pi^(1/3) / ( (pi)^(2/6) ) )= pi^(1/3 - 1/3) )= pi^0=1.

Because 4^(1/6) is (2²)^(1/6) = 2^(1/3), and (pi²)^(1/6) = pi^(1/3).

Wait, let me compute the denominator: 4^(1/6) = (2²)^(1/6) = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

(pi²)^(1/6) = (pi)^(2/6) = pi^(1/3) ≈ 2.15.

So the denominator in the fraction is 4^(1/6) * (pi^2)^(1/6) ) = (4 pi² )^(1/6) ) = [ (2^2)(pi^2) ]^(1/6) )= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ≈ 1.26 * 2.15 ≈ 2.72.

But perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to accept that after simplification, the constants can be combined, and K is proportional to (M_p ) * sqrt( G ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) ) )

Wait, because all the other terms are constants (like G, c, and others), so K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think K is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), but let me think again.

Wait, I recall that K is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2) times (M_p) and other terms. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of a.

From Kepler's law, a^3 = ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi² )

But perhaps it's better to find the relation between K and a. Let me think: from the expression for K, which includes P, and from Kepler's law, which relates a and P.

Let me try to eliminate P from the equations. From Kepler's law:

P² = (4 pi² a^3 )/( G M_star )

So P = (4 pi² a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substitute into K, which is:

K = [ (27 pi G )^(1/3) / c ] * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

Substituting P:

K = [ (27 pi G )^(1/3) / c ] * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * [ ( G M_star )/(4 pi² a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Simplify each term:

27 pi G = 3^3 pi G, so (27 pi G )^(1/3) = 3 pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)

Denominator: c is a constant.

So,

3 pi^(1/3) G^(1/3) / c * M_p / M_star^(2/3) * [ ( G M_star )/(4 pi² a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

= 3 G^(1/3) pi^(1/3) M_p / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / (4^(1/6) pi^(2/6) a^(3*(1/6)) ) )

Simplify exponents:

G^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)

M_star^(-2/3 + 1/6) = M_star^(-1/2 )

a^(-3*(1/6)) = a^(-1/2 )

And the other terms:

pi^(1/3) / pi^(2/6) = pi^(1/3 - 1/3) )= pi^0=1.

4^(1/6) = 2^(1/3).

So,

3 G^(1/2) M_p / ( c 2^(1/3) ) * 1 / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

So, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

But since G, c, and other constants are the same for both planets, we can write:

K1 / K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because,

K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a M_star )

Wait, because K ∝ M_p / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because:

K1/K2 = [ (M1)/(M_star^(1/2) a1^(1/2)) ) ] / [ (M2)/(M_star^(1/2) a2^(1/2)) ) ]

= (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/2 )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can rearrange this to find a2/a1.

Given K1 and K2, and M1 and M2, we can compute the ratio.

From the question:

K1 = 0.03 Å

K2 = 0.04 Å

M1 = 7 Earth masses

M2 = 5 Earth masses

So,

0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, 0.03/0.04 is 0.75. 7/5 is 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Square both sides:

(0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287 ≈ a2/a1

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.287

Which implies that a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Wait, no, because a2 is smaller than a1.

Wait, a2/a1 is about 0.287, so a2 is smaller than a1.

So, the planet with the smaller a is Planet2?

Wait, K is the semi-amplitude of the RV shift. A higher K means the star is moving more, which would happen if the planet is more massive or closer to the star (since closer orbit implies higher velocity). But according to our calculation, K1 is 0.03, K2 is 0.04, so K2 > K1.

So, from K1/K2 = 0.75, and the equation:

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 *5/7 = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (225)/(784) ≈ 0.287.

So, a2 = 0.287 a1

Which means that Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

But wait, I thought that the Doppler shift K depends on both the mass and the distance. So a higher K could mean either a more massive planet or a planet that's closer (or both). So in this case, Planet2 has a lower mass than Planet1 (5 Earth masses vs 7), but a higher K. That implies that Planet2 is closer to the star.

So, the a ratio is a2/a1 = 0.287, so a1 is larger than a2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the equilibrium temperature ratio Te1/Te2.

Earlier, we found that Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio of temperatures would be sqrt( a2/a1 )^(-1/2?), wait no:

Wait, earlier conclusion was that Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L (1-A))^(1/4) * (1/(a))^(1/2)

So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a)

So, Te1/Te2 = (1/sqrt(a1)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1 )

Yes, that's correct.

So, since a2/a1 is 0.287, Te1/Te2 = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.54, which is close to option C, which is ~0.53.

Wait, option C is ~0.53.

But let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.287^(1/2):

0.287 = approx 0.287.

The square root of 0.287 is approx 0.536.

Which is close to 0.53.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is ~0.536, so the answer would be option C (~0.53).

Wait, but let's double-check the steps.

We had K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04.

So K1/K2 = 0.75.

The formula is K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

=> sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 * (5/7) )

= (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 225/784 ≈ 0.287

Then, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.54, but option C is ~0.53. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio.

Wait, the initial equation:

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is 3/4 = 7/5 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7 ) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

Squaring that gives a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

Then, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.5357, which is approximately 0.536, so about 0.54.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (~0.53) and option A is 0.98, which is about inverse, but no, because Te1 is the smaller one.

Wait, but we have to be careful about which planet is which. If a2 is smaller, Te2 should be higher because it's closer to the star.

Wait, because equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a2 is smaller, Te2 is higher. So Te1/Te2 = 0.536, meaning Te1 is about half of Te2.

So, the temperature ratio is approximately 0.536:1, so the ratio is ~0.53, which corresponds to option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's luminosity and other constants cancel out when taking the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_2/a_1\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the star's mass \(M_\text{star}\), and the orbital period \(P\). From the RV method, \(K\) is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{a}\) for a given planet mass. The relationship between \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\)

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = 0.75 \cdot 0.7143 = 0.5357
\]

Squaring this result gives:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Finally, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This value is closest to option C, which is approximately 0.53. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, the formula is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/ (1 + epsilon) )^0.25, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, so it's proportional to the star's luminosity and inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance squared, but wait, let me get this straight.

The formula I think is Te = ( (L * (1 - A)) / (16 * π * σ * a²) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the orbital distance. But since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the A term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures should depend on the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, but how do I get their distances from the star? The question gives data from transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method gives the radius of the planet, which affects the depth of the transit. The radial velocity gives the mass of the planet, based on the Doppler shift.

But for calculating equilibrium temperature, the main factors are the planet's distance from the star and the star's characteristics. Since both stars are detected using both methods, their orbital periods can be found, but the question doesn't give their orbital periods. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can find the relation between the two planets' semi-major axes (distances) from the given RV data.

The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis. The RV shift is proportional to (M_planet * sin(i)) / (M_star), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are in circular orbits, and we're using the RV method, perhaps the semi-major axis can be found from the RV data. But I'm not exactly sure how.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity, which is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/ (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )... Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, the question doesn't mention inclination, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that sin i is 1, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to get RV measurements (i=90 degrees, edge-on). So sin i = 1.

Wait, but the actual formula I remember is K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift given for each planet. The question states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. So the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift, right? Because the semi-amplitude is the maximum velocity measured, which for the same star, is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/3)), or something like that.

Wait, another approach. The RV shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass, but the star's velocity is much smaller, so the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/ something? Hmm, maybe better to use the simplified version.

Another way: The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) = (28.4 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (P / yr) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_star + M_p) / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) / (1 - e² )^(1/2 )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the relation between the Doppler shifts and the semi-major axes. Since both planets are detected via RV, their K values are given. The higher K means the star is moving more due to the planet's gravitational pull. So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^alpha a^beta)), where alpha and beta are exponents. Let me see.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward relationship between K and the planet's parameters.

Wait, here's a formula I found in notes: K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (P c ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But since e=0, that term is 1. Also, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / (c^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Hmm. So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

But how do I relate this to the semi-major axis a? Because the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law. So Kepler's law says:

P² = (4 pi² a³) / ( G (M_star + M_p) )

Again, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so P² ≈ (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star )

So a³ = ( G M_star P² ) / (4 pi² )

So a = [ ( G M_star P² ) / (4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

Hmm, but substituting that into the K equation would complicate things. Alternatively, from the K expression, since K is proportional to (M_p)/(M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)), and from Kepler's law, a is proportional to ( M_star P² )^(1/3 )

So, a ∝ M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3 )

Wait, so if I have two planets, say 1 and 2, their K1 and K2 are given. So K1/K2 = [ (M1 sin i1 ) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M2 sin i2 ) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

The M_star and sin i terms can be approximated as same for both (since same star and same inclination, presumably), so K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

Hmm, but without knowing P1 and P2, how can I find the ratio of a1 and a2?

Wait, but the transit method gives the planet's radius, but that's for the transit depth. It doesn't directly give the distance, but combined with the RV data, perhaps we can get the period. Oh! Because the transit method gives the period as the time between transits, which is the orbital period. So the periods are known. But wait, the question doesn't give the periods. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that both planets are detected using both methods. So, for each planet, their periods can be found from the transit timing. But the question doesn't provide the periods, so maybe we can't proceed that way. Hmm, perhaps the key is that the Doppler shifts (K values) are inversely proportional to the semi-major axes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes. Since Te is proportional to (L / a² )^0.25, and L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, the star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R_star² sigma Teff^4. So L is proportional to R_star² Teff^4. The star has R = 1.2 Rsun and Teff = 6300 K. The Sun has Teff about 5778 K. But I'm not sure if that's necessary because both planets orbit the same star, so when taking the ratio, the L terms will cancel.

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures Te1/Te2 is sqrt( ( a2 / a1 ) ) * ( (L1/(16 pi sigma a1² (1-A)))^0.25 ) / ( (L2/(16 pi sigma a2² (1-A)))^0.25 )

Wait, but L1 and L2 are the same because it's the same star. So the ratio becomes (a2/a1)^(1/4) * ( (1/(a1²)) / (1/(a2²)) )^(1/4 ) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The equilibrium temperature formula is: 

Te = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^0.25

So, when taking the ratio Te1/Te2, it becomes [ (L (1-A)) / (16 pi sigma a1²) )^0.25 ] / [ (L (1-A)) / (16 pi sigma a2²) )^0.25 ]

Simplifying, ( (a2²)/(a1²) )^0.25 = (a2/a1)^(0.5) = sqrt(a2/a1).

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Thus, if I can find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root to get the temperature ratio.

So the key is to find a1 and a2, or a2/a1.

But how?

From the RV data, we have K1 and K2. The semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period (and hence semi-major axis).

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) / (c ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But Kepler's third law says P² = (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star )

So P = [ (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi² a³ ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it step by step.

Express P in terms of a:

P = ( (4 pi² a³)/(G M_star) )^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

So 1/P^(1/3) = [ (G M_star )/(4 pi² a³) ) ]^(1/6 )

Now plug into K:

K ≈ (27 pi G )^(1/3) / c ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * [ (G M_star )/(4 pi² a³ ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Let me simplify each term.

27 pi G = 3^3 pi G, so (27 pi G )^(1/3) = 3 (pi G )^(1/3 )

So,

K ≈ [3 (pi G )^(1/3) / c ] * [ M_p / M_star^(2/3) ] * [ ( G M_star )^(1/6) / (4 pi² a³ )^(1/6) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/2)
M_star^(-2/3) * M_star^(1/6) = M_star^(-1/2 )
a^(-3*(1/6)) = a^(-1/2 )

So,

K ≈ [3 (pi )^(1/3) G^(1/3) / c ] * M_p * ( G^(1/2) M_star^(-1/2) ) / (4^(1/6) (pi^2)^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) )

Combine the constants:

pi^(1/3) / (4^(1/6) (pi^2)^(1/6) ) ) = pi^(1/3) / ( (pi)^(2/6) ) )= pi^(1/3 - 1/3) )= pi^0=1.

Because 4^(1/6) is (2²)^(1/6) = 2^(1/3), and (pi²)^(1/6) = pi^(1/3).

Wait, let me compute the denominator: 4^(1/6) = (2²)^(1/6) = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

(pi²)^(1/6) = (pi)^(2/6) = pi^(1/3) ≈ 2.15.

So the denominator in the fraction is 4^(1/6) * (pi^2)^(1/6) ) = (4 pi² )^(1/6) ) = [ (2^2)(pi^2) ]^(1/6) )= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ≈ 1.26 * 2.15 ≈ 2.72.

But perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to accept that after simplification, the constants can be combined, and K is proportional to (M_p ) * sqrt( G ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) ) )

Wait, because all the other terms are constants (like G, c, and others), so K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think K is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), but let me think again.

Wait, I recall that K is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2) times (M_p) and other terms. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of a.

From Kepler's law, a^3 = ( G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi² )

But perhaps it's better to find the relation between K and a. Let me think: from the expression for K, which includes P, and from Kepler's law, which relates a and P.

Let me try to eliminate P from the equations. From Kepler's law:

P² = (4 pi² a^3 )/( G M_star )

So P = (4 pi² a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substitute into K, which is:

K = [ (27 pi G )^(1/3) / c ] * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

Substituting P:

K = [ (27 pi G )^(1/3) / c ] * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * [ ( G M_star )/(4 pi² a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Simplify each term:

27 pi G = 3^3 pi G, so (27 pi G )^(1/3) = 3 pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)

Denominator: c is a constant.

So,

3 pi^(1/3) G^(1/3) / c * M_p / M_star^(2/3) * [ ( G M_star )/(4 pi² a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

= 3 G^(1/3) pi^(1/3) M_p / ( c M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) / (4^(1/6) pi^(2/6) a^(3*(1/6)) ) )

Simplify exponents:

G^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)

M_star^(-2/3 + 1/6) = M_star^(-1/2 )

a^(-3*(1/6)) = a^(-1/2 )

And the other terms:

pi^(1/3) / pi^(2/6) = pi^(1/3 - 1/3) )= pi^0=1.

4^(1/6) = 2^(1/3).

So,

3 G^(1/2) M_p / ( c 2^(1/3) ) * 1 / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

So, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

But since G, c, and other constants are the same for both planets, we can write:

K1 / K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because,

K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a M_star )

Wait, because K ∝ M_p / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because:

K1/K2 = [ (M1)/(M_star^(1/2) a1^(1/2)) ) ] / [ (M2)/(M_star^(1/2) a2^(1/2)) ) ]

= (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/2 )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can rearrange this to find a2/a1.

Given K1 and K2, and M1 and M2, we can compute the ratio.

From the question:

K1 = 0.03 Å

K2 = 0.04 Å

M1 = 7 Earth masses

M2 = 5 Earth masses

So,

0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, 0.03/0.04 is 0.75. 7/5 is 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Square both sides:

(0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287 ≈ a2/a1

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.287

Which implies that a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Wait, no, because a2 is smaller than a1.

Wait, a2/a1 is about 0.287, so a2 is smaller than a1.

So, the planet with the smaller a is Planet2?

Wait, K is the semi-amplitude of the RV shift. A higher K means the star is moving more, which would happen if the planet is more massive or closer to the star (since closer orbit implies higher velocity). But according to our calculation, K1 is 0.03, K2 is 0.04, so K2 > K1.

So, from K1/K2 = 0.75, and the equation:

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 *5/7 = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (225)/(784) ≈ 0.287.

So, a2 = 0.287 a1

Which means that Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

But wait, I thought that the Doppler shift K depends on both the mass and the distance. So a higher K could mean either a more massive planet or a planet that's closer (or both). So in this case, Planet2 has a lower mass than Planet1 (5 Earth masses vs 7), but a higher K. That implies that Planet2 is closer to the star.

So, the a ratio is a2/a1 = 0.287, so a1 is larger than a2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the equilibrium temperature ratio Te1/Te2.

Earlier, we found that Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio of temperatures would be sqrt( a2/a1 )^(-1/2?), wait no:

Wait, earlier conclusion was that Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L (1-A))^(1/4) * (1/(a))^(1/2)

So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a)

So, Te1/Te2 = (1/sqrt(a1)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1 )

Yes, that's correct.

So, since a2/a1 is 0.287, Te1/Te2 = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.54, which is close to option C, which is ~0.53.

Wait, option C is ~0.53.

But let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.287^(1/2):

0.287 = approx 0.287.

The square root of 0.287 is approx 0.536.

Which is close to 0.53.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is ~0.536, so the answer would be option C (~0.53).

Wait, but let's double-check the steps.

We had K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04.

So K1/K2 = 0.75.

The formula is K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

=> sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 * (5/7) )

= (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So, a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 225/784 ≈ 0.287

Then, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.54, but option C is ~0.53. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio.

Wait, the initial equation:

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is 3/4 = 7/5 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7 ) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

Squaring that gives a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

Then, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.5357, which is approximately 0.536, so about 0.54.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (~0.53) and option A is 0.98, which is about inverse, but no, because Te1 is the smaller one.

Wait, but we have to be careful about which planet is which. If a2 is smaller, Te2 should be higher because it's closer to the star.

Wait, because equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a2 is smaller, Te2 is higher. So Te1/Te2 = 0.536, meaning Te1 is about half of Te2.

So, the temperature ratio is approximately 0.536:1, so the ratio is ~0.53, which corresponds to option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's luminosity and other constants cancel out when taking the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_2/a_1\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the star's mass \(M_\text{star}\), and the orbital period \(P\). From the RV method, \(K\) is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{a}\) for a given planet mass. The relationship between \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\)

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = 0.75 \cdot 0.7143 = 0.5357
\]

Squaring this result gives:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Finally, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This value is closest to option C, which is approximately 0.53. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

**Answer: C**
