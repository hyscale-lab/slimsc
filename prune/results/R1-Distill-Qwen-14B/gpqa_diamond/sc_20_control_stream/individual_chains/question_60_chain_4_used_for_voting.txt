Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's the whole theory of relativity thing, right? So the astronaut's own time would be different from the time observed from Earth. 

The problem says the aliens are traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really close to c. I think that's like 99.999987% the speed. So they're moving at a substantial fraction, which definitely means relativistic effects are important here.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective. Wait, so we're looking for the proper time, the time experienced by the astronaut. Because when you're moving at such high speeds, your own time runs slower compared to someone at rest (like someone on Earth).

Wait, but wait. No, actually, I might have that backwards. If the astronaut is moving relative to Earth, from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock runs slower. But from the astronaut's perspective, it's Earth that's moving away at a high speed, so for the astronaut, the distance would be contracted. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be less than what someone on Earth would calculate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The time experienced by the traveler (the astronaut) is the proper time, which is the shortest time possible. Because time dilation affects the moving frame. So from Earth's perspective, the time taken for the trip would be longer, but the astronaut's own time would be shorter.

Wait, but what's the actual question? It's asking how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their own point of view. So I need to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut.

So first, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, I don't know that. Wait, maybe I don't need the actual distance because the problem might be giving the necessary information in another way. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Oh, so that's the average lifespan from their own perspective, right? Because their own lifespan is 150 years. So if the trip takes, say, 100 years from their perspective, they'd live long enough to make it.

But let me get back to the problem. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. Let's denote that as v. So v is 0.99999987c.

I need to find the proper time, τ (tau), experienced by the astronaut. The formula for proper time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. But wait, I don't know t yet. Or do I?

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, then compute the time from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, I don't have the distance given. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is more about the effects of time dilation without needing the exact distance. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps it's about the average lifetime and the time taken for the trip.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. Their average lifespan is 150 years. So from their perspective, the trip would take some number of years, and we need to see if they live long enough.

Wait, but the question is asking how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective, not whether they live long enough. Oh, but the options include "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth." So perhaps the time it takes is longer than their lifespan.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 years. So from their perspective, they have about 150 - 22 = 128 years left to live. If the trip takes more than that, they won't make it.

So first, I need to find the time τ as experienced by the astronaut.

To find τ, I need the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and then calculate τ using the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but I don't know the actual distance. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using the LMC's distance as a given? Let me recall: The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, that's a figure I remember. So approximately 163,000 light-years. So the distance d is about 1.63e5 light-years.

But wait, the problem says LMC is their home, and they're traveling to Earth. So the distance is roughly 163,000 light-years.

Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't give any numbers about distance. So perhaps it's expecting me to know that the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to compute based on the given speed and perhaps using the Earth's frame time.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the time it takes from Earth's view and then apply time dilation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame: t = distance / speed.

2. Then, the astronaut's proper time τ is t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but v is 0.99999987c, so v is very close to c. So the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ (1 - 1.23e-6)². Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.23e-6. So when I square that, (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a when a is very small.

So (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.23e-6) = 1 - 2.46e-6 ≈ 0.99999754.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999754 = 2.46e-6.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.46e-6) ≈ 0.001568.

So gamma = 1 / 0.001568 ≈ approximately 637. So gamma is about 637.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.23e-6. So (v/c) = 0.99999987.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute this as (1 - 1.23e-6)^2 = 1 - 2 * 1.23e-6 + (1.23e-6)^2. The last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.46e-6. So 0.99999754.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.46e-6.

sqrt(2.46e-6) = sqrt(2.46) * 1e-3.

sqrt(2.46) is approx sqrt(2.25)=1.5, sqrt(2.56)=1.6, so 1.57 (since 1.57^2=2.4649). So approximately 1.57e-3.

So gamma is 1/(1.57e-3) ≈ 636.9.

So gamma is approximately 637.

So, now, the distance from LMC to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time t is d / v.

Wait, but d is in light-years, and v is a fraction of c. So time in years would be (d [ly]) / (v [c fraction]) ) * years. Because light travels 1 ly in 1 year, so time t = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) * (1 ly / c) = (163,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Wait, that's about 163,000 / 1 years, since 0.99999987 is almost 1. So t ≈ 163,000 years from Earth's perspective.

So the Earth-based time is about 163,000 years. Then the astronaut's proper time τ is t / gamma.

Because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

So tau is 163,000 / 637 ≈ let's compute that. 163000 ÷ 637.

Let me compute 637 * 255 = 637 * 200=127400, 637*50=31,850 → 127400+31850=159,250. 637*255=159,255. The difference between 163,000 and 159,255 is 3745. 3745 ÷ 637 ≈ 5.88.

So 255 + 5.88 ≈ 260.88 years. So approximately 261 years.

Wait, but wait, so the astronaut would experience about 260 years of their own time. But their lifespan is 150 years, so 260 > 150. So they wouldn't live long enough, meaning they would die before reaching Earth. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is 1/ (sqrt(2.46e-6)) → which is 1 / 0.00157 → approximately 637. So yes.

The time from Earth's frame is t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 → which is about 163,000.021 years. So 163,000 years is a good approximation.

Then, tau is t / gamma → 163000 / 637 ≈ let me compute more accurately.

Compute 637 * 256 = 637*(200 +50 +6) = 127400 + 31,850 + 3,822 → 127400+31850=159,250; 159,250 +3,822=163,072.

Wait, so 637 * 256 = 163,072. So 163,000 is 72 less than 163,072. So 256 minus (72/637) → 72/637 ≈ 0.113 → so 256 - 0.113 ≈ 255.887.

So tau is approximately 255.89 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old, so from their perspective, they have 255.89 years to live. But their average lifespan is 150 years.

Wait, wait, wait, no! Wait, their own lifespan is 150 years. So if the trip takes 255 years from their perspective, they won't live that long. Because their own lifespan is 150, which is less than 255.

So the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. So the answer is option A.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation.

Wait, the time t from Earth's perspective is 163,000 years, but the astronaut's time is 255 years. So, no, 255 is longer than 150, so they die.

But wait, that can't be right because the astronaut's own time should be less than the Earth's frame time. Because they're moving, so their clock runs slow.

Wait, wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe I should use tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), not t / gamma.

Wait, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So tau = t * (1/gamma) → which is t / gamma.

Wait, so with t as 163,000, gamma as 637, tau is 163000 / 637 ≈ 255.89 years.

So the astronaut's own time is about 255.89 years. But they are 22 when they start, so they would live 255.89 -22 = 233.89 years. But their lifespan is 150, so they can't live that long. So the trip would take longer than their lifetime, so they die before reaching Earth.

So the answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if the ship is moving at 0.99999987c, isn't time for the astronaut much shorter? Or is this correct?

Wait, let me think about it. The distance from LMC to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time it takes is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

But the astronaut's proper time is shorter. Because from their frame, the distance is contracted. So the distance is d' = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is d / gamma.

So the time experienced, tau, is (d' / v) → (d / (gamma * v)) → (d / (gamma * v)) → since d = v * t, t = d /v.

So tau = (d/(gamma * v)) ) → which is t / gamma.

So yeah, tau is t / gamma = (163,000 years) / 637 ≈ 255.89 years.

So the astronaut lives 255.89 years, but their lifespan is 150, so they die before the trip is completed.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Let me think again. The LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So if the speed is 0.99999987c, in Earth's frame, the time is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. Then tau is 163,000 / 637 ≈ 255.89 years. So the astronaut would take 255 years of their own time to reach Earth, but they're 22, so 255 > 150-22=128 → so they die.

Hence, the answer is A.

To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for relativistic time dilation. The astronaut is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t \)):**  
   The time it takes to travel from the LMC to Earth, as measured in Earth's frame, is given by:  
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Factor (\( \gamma \)):**  
   The Lorentz factor is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]  
   Since \( v = 0.99999987c \), we compute:  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999754, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.46 \times 10^{-6}.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.46 \times 10^{-6}}} \approx 637.
   \]

3. **Proper Time (\( \tau \)):**  
   The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000}{637} \approx 255.89 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Lifespan:**  
   The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years. From their perspective, the trip takes approximately 255.89 years, which is longer than their remaining lifespan (\( 150 - 22 = 128 \, \text{years} \)). Therefore, the astronaut will not survive the journey.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will die before reaching Earth. 

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs.

Wait, the question says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Oh, so that's the average lifespan from their own perspective, right? Because their own lifespan is 150 years. So if the trip takes, say, 100 years from their perspective, they'd live long enough to make it.

But let me get back to the problem. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. Let's denote that as v. So v is 0.99999987c.

I need to find the proper time, τ (tau), experienced by the astronaut. The formula for proper time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. But wait, I don't know t yet. Or do I?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 years. So from their perspective, they have about 150 - 22 = 128 years left to live. If the trip takes more than that, they won't make it.

So first, I need to find the time τ as experienced by the astronaut.

To find τ, I need the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and then calculate τ using the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but I don't know the actual distance. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using the LMC's distance as a given? Let me recall: The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, that's a figure I remember. So approximately 163,000 light-years. So the distance d is about 1.63e5 light-years.

But wait, the problem says LMC is their home, and they're traveling to Earth. So the distance is roughly 163,000 light-years.

Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't give any numbers about distance. So perhaps it's expecting me to know that the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to compute based on the given speed and perhaps using the Earth's frame time.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the time it takes from Earth's view and then apply time dilation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame: t = distance / speed.

2. Then, the astronaut's proper time τ is t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but v is 0.99999987c, so v is very close to c. So the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ (1 - 1.23e-6)². Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.23e-6. So when I square that, (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a when a is very small.

So (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.23e-6) = 1 - 2.46e-6 ≈ 0.99999754.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999754 = 2.46e-6.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.46e-6) ≈ 0.001568.

So gamma = 1 / 0.001568 ≈ approximately 637. So gamma is about 637.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.23e-6. So (v/c) = 0.99999987.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute this as (1 - 1.23e-6)^2 = 1 - 2 * 1.23e-6 + (1.23e-6)^2. The last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.46e-6. So 0.99999754.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.46e-6.

sqrt(2.46e-6) = sqrt(2.46) * 1e-3.

sqrt(2.46) is approx sqrt(2.25)=1.5, sqrt(2.56)=1.6, so 1.57 (since 1.57^2=2.4649). So approximately 1.57e-3.

So gamma is 1/(1.57e-3) ≈ 636.9.

So gamma is approximately 637.

So, now, the distance from LMC to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time t is d / v.

Wait, but d is in light-years, and v is a fraction of c. So time in years would be (d [ly]) / (v [c fraction]) ) * years. Because light travels 1 ly in 1 year, so time t = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) * (1 ly / c) = (163,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Wait, that's about 163,000 / 1 years, since 0.99999987 is almost 1. So t ≈ 163,000 years from Earth's perspective.

So the Earth-based time is about 163,000 years. Then the astronaut's proper time τ is t / gamma.

Because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

So tau is 163,000 / 637 ≈ let's compute that. 163000 ÷ 637.

Let me compute 637 * 255 = 637 * 200=127400, 637*50=31,850 → 127400+31850=159,250. 637*255=159,255. The difference between 163,000 and 159,255 is 3745. 3745 ÷ 637 ≈ 5.88.

So 255 + 5.88 ≈ 260.88 years. So approximately 261 years.

Wait, but wait, so the astronaut would experience about 260 years of their own time. But their lifespan is 150 years, so 260 > 150. So they wouldn't live long enough, meaning they would die before reaching Earth. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is 1/ (sqrt(2.46e-6)) → which is 1 / 0.00157 → approximately 637. So yes.

The time from Earth's frame is t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 → which is about 163,000.021 years. So 163,000 years is a good approximation.

Then, tau is t / gamma → 163000 / 637 ≈ let me compute more accurately.

Compute 637 * 256 = 637*(200 +50 +6) = 127400 + 31,850 + 3,822 → 127400+31850=159,250; 159,250 +3,822=163,072.

Wait, so 637 * 256 = 163,072. So 163,000 is 72 less than 163,072. So 256 minus (72/637) → 72/637 ≈ 0.113 → so 256 - 0.113 ≈ 255.887.

So tau is approximately 255.89 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old, so from their perspective, they have 255.89 years to live. But their average lifespan is 150 years.

Wait, wait, wait, no! Wait, their own lifespan is 150 years. So if the trip takes 255 years from their perspective, they won't live that long. Because their own lifespan is 150, which is less than 255.

So the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. So the answer is option A.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation.

Wait, the time t from Earth's perspective is 163,000 years, but the astronaut's time is 255 years. So, no, 255 is longer than 150, so they die.

But wait, that can't be right because the astronaut's own time should be less than the Earth's frame time. Because they're moving, so their clock runs slow.

Wait, wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe I should use tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), not t / gamma.

Wait, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So tau = t * (1/gamma) → which is t / gamma.

Wait, so with t as 163,000, gamma as 637, tau is 163000 / 637 ≈ 255.89 years.

So the astronaut's own time is about 255.89 years. But they are 22 when they start, so they would live 255.89 -22 = 233.89 years. But their lifespan is 150, so they can't live that long. So the trip would take longer than their lifetime, so they die before reaching Earth.

So the answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if the ship is moving at 0.99999987c, isn't time for the astronaut much shorter? Or is this correct?

Wait, let me think about it. The distance from LMC to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time it takes is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

But the astronaut's proper time is shorter. Because from their frame, the distance is contracted. So the distance is d' = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is d / gamma.

So the time experienced, tau, is (d' / v) → (d / (gamma * v)) → (d / (gamma * v)) → since d = v * t, t = d /v.

So tau = (d/(gamma * v)) ) → which is t / gamma.

So yeah, tau is t / gamma = (163,000 years) / 637 ≈ 255.89 years.

So the astronaut lives 255.89 years, but their lifespan is 150, so they die before the trip is completed.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Let me think again. The LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So if the speed is 0.99999987c, in Earth's frame, the time is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. Then tau is 163,000 / 637 ≈ 255.89 years. So the astronaut would take 255 years of their own time to reach Earth, but they're 22, so 255 > 150-22=128 → so they die.

Hence, the answer is A.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for relativistic time dilation. The astronaut is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t \)):**  
   The time it takes to travel from the LMC to Earth, as measured in Earth's frame, is given by:  
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Factor (\( \gamma \)):**  
   The Lorentz factor is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]  
   Since \( v = 0.99999987c \), we compute:  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999754, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.46 \times 10^{-6}.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.46 \times 10^{-6}}} \approx 637.
   \]

3. **Proper Time (\( \tau \)):**  
   The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000}{637} \approx 255.89 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Lifespan:**  
   The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years. From their perspective, the trip takes approximately 255.89 years, which is longer than their remaining lifespan (\( 150 - 22 = 128 \, \text{years} \)). Therefore, the astronaut will not survive the journey.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.
