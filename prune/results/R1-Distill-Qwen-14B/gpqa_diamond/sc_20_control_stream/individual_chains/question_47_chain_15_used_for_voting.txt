Okay, so I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see, the IR and NMR data are provided, and I have four options to choose from. I'll take it step by step.

First, the IR data. The strong absorption at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. That's probably a C=O stretch, which is common in amides, esters, or maybe ketones. The medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 likely correspond to N-H or O-H stretches. But looking at the options, I don't see any hydroxyl groups (like in phenols or carboxylic acids), so maybe these are N-H stretches. That makes me think of amides or amines. Wait, the molecular formula has one N, so maybe it's an amide.

Looking at the options:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide has an amide group, so that's a possibility.
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Also an amide.
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: That's an amino group and an ester? Wait, propionate is a carboxylic acid ester. So the molecule would have an NH2 group and an ester.
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: That has an amine and an ester.

Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1750. If it's an amide, the carbonyl is a bit lower, like 1640-1690. Hmm, but I've heard that amides can have higher wavenumbers too. Or maybe it's an acyl chloride, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, but looking at the options, options B and D have ester groups. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a formamide, which has a carbonyl around 1680-1700, so 1720 might be a bit high for an amide but possible. Or maybe it's an ester.

Also, the IR shows N-H stretches. So in the case of an amide, the N-H would be present. If it's an amide, then the stretching would be around 3300-3500. Looking at the options, option A is a benzamide (amide), options B is a formamide (another amide), C is a propionate (ester) with an amine, and D is an ester with an amine.

So, if it's an amide, then options A and B are possible. If it's an ester with an amine, then C and D are possibilities. Let's look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows peaks at:
1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet (t) suggests it's attached to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl group attached somewhere else.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or possibly an NH2 group, but that's usually a broad peak but in what region? Amines can show up around 1-5 ppm, but if it's NH2, it's often a broad peak, but sometimes exchange broadening. But if it's an OCH2, like in an ester, then the OCH2 would be around 3.5-4.5 ppm.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. A quartet suggests it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe a CH2O group next to another CH2. Like OCH2CH2O? Or perhaps an N-CH2-CO? Wait, in an ester, the structure is O-CO-O-ethyl. So the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, so that's the CH2CH3. Then the OCH2 would be around 4-4.5. So in the NMR, the triplet at 1.2 is the ethyl group attached to oxygen. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2.

Wait, but the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2H. So perhaps that's the OCH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but ethyl esters have OCH2CH3. The methyl (CH3) group is a triplet at 1.2, so that's the CH3 of an ethyl group. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3. Wait, but in ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm. So in the data, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H, perhaps that's the OCH2.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is Ph-CO-NH2. But wait, no, the structure would be Ph-CO-NH2 with an OCH2CH3 at position 3. Wait, no, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the amide group at position 1, and the ethoxy at position 3. So the structure is O-CO-NH2 attached to benzene, and an OCH2CH3 at position 3.

But the NMR would show the ethoxy group (CH2CH3) as a triplet. The OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, we have 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Hmm, maybe that's not matching?

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be something else, like NH2? But if it's an amide, the NH2 would be next to the carbonyl. In a primary amide, the NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear around 3-4 ppm. But in the IR, the N-H is around 3300-3400, which matches.

But looking at the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's an NH2, then that might fit. But in that case, the quartet at 4.5 ppm is 2H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group which is split into a quartet. Wait, but it's a quartet in 4.5, so OCH2 would be at 4.5 as a quartet. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Maybe that's the NH2 group.

Wait, but in the options, option A is an amide (so NH2), option B is a formamide, which is HCONHR, so it would have an NH group as well.

Let me think about the aromatic region.

The NMR shows 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Each doublet indicates coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps it's a symmetrical substitution, like two substituents opposite each other. For instance, an ethoxy group and an amide group in para positions.

Wait, but let's think about each option's structure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2COOEt. So the benzoate ester is attached to an amino group in the para position. The benzene would have substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoate would be the amino group at position 4 relative to the COOEt group. So the benzene ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. If substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt) would be equivalent, and the protons in positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOEt) would be another set.

Wait, perhaps the substitution pattern would lead to two doublets, each integrating for 2H. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, like if two substituents are opposite each other, the aromatic protons would be as two sets of doublets.

So let's think about each option's substitution.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The substituents are COOEt and NH2 in para positions. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. So the aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOEt, and the protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOEt.

In such a case, the protons ortho to COOEt (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The meta protons (3 and 5) would be more shielded and appear upfield. So in the NMR, perhaps a doublet around 8 ppm (for the ortho protons) and another around 7 ppm (for the meta protons).

Looking at the NMR data, 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) fit this pattern. So that's a possibility.

But let's check the other options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is PhNH2 with a propiono ester. Hmm, but the formula might not match. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see:

PhNH2 is C6H5NH2. Propionate is C3H5O2. Wait, but in the ester, it's CH2CH2COO- attached to something else. Wait, maybe ethyl propionate is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but here the ester would be OCH2CH3, and the acid part is CH2CH2COOH.

But for option C, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be O=C(O-)OCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, along with NH2. So the molecular formula would be C6H4 (NH2)(COOCH2CH2CH3). Let's count: 6 carbons from benzene, 3 from the propionate, and one from the NH2? Wait, no, benzene is C6, propionate is C3, but the ester is OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, so total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) = 9. Hydrogens: benzene is 5H (since one is substituted), but wait, the benzene in 4-aminophenyl propionate would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the H count: benzene has 4 H in para positions. Let me think. It's getting complicated, but molecular formula is given as C9H11NO2. Let's confirm:

PhNH2 is C6H5NH2: 6 C, 5 H (benzene) + 2 H (NH2) = 7 H. The propiono ester is CH2CH2COOEt? Wait, propionate ester would be (CH2)2COOEt. So the ester group is O-CO-OEt, where Et is CH2CH3.

Wait, the propionate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. So the propionate ester has 3 carbons from the acid and 2 from the ethyl (if ethyl ester), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to count carbons for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2COOEt.

Ph is C6H5, NH2COOEt is C3H5NO2. So total C:6+3=9. H: 5 (Ph) +5 (NH2COOEt? Let me see: NH2 is 2 H, COOEt is OEt (CH2CH3), which has 2 H on O and 5 H from CH2CH3? Wait, wait, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the ester group is OCH2CH3, which has 2 H (CH2) and 3 H (CH3), but in the structure, the OCH2CH3 would have 2 H on the CH2 and 3 on the CH3. So the molecule's H count: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, COOEt and NH2 are para), and the ester group contributes 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 2 and 3 H). Plus the NH2 has 2 H. So total H:4 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +2 (NH2) =11. That matches the formula C9H11NO2.

Option D's formula is correct.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: O-CO-NH2 attached to benzene, with OCH2CH3 at position 3. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 1 (CO-NH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3). So the aromatic protons would be a bit more complex. The protons ortho to CO-NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, while those meta would be more shielded. But in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions, making the aromatic Hs a bit more complex. The NMR would show more than two sets of protons, perhaps, unless it's symmetrical. Wait, but in the given data, there are only two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which suggests a para-substitution pattern. So maybe option A is not the correct structure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONHPh-OCH2CH3, where the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide group) and 4 (ethoxy). So the benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the aromatic protons similar to option D but with different substituents. The aromatic protons would again be two doublets, each 2H, which fits the data. So the NMR would have 7.0 and 8.0 ppm regions as doublets.

Looking at the NMR shifts, the formamide group (HCONHR) would have the carbonyl around 1720, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would have triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5.

But what about the other peaks. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) in the NMR: what is that? If it's an NH group, perhaps. But formamide has a NH group. Wait, formamide is HCONHR. So the NH would be a singlet or a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the NH in formamide would be around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, maybe.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The 4.0 ppm peak in the NMR is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be the NH2 group from an amide? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, looking back at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t,3H) → ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → could be NH2? But NH2 protons are usually broader and appear around 1-5 ppm. If it's NH2 in an amide, it would be a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but why would OCH2 be a broad singlet? OCH2 is usually a quartet or triplet.

Wait, in option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is PhNH2COOEt. So the NH2 group would be in the ortho position relative to the COOEt. The NH2 protons would be split by the adjacent carbonyl group but would appear in the NMR as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2 group.

But wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H, which would correspond to the OCH2 in the ethyl ester. Let me think about the splitting. The OCH2 group in ethyl ester is connected to the O of the carbonyl. The OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (since it's next to CH3, which has 3 H). The CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2 ppm, which matches the data.

So the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet, but in the data, it's at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, that's a bit higher than I'd expect. Maybe it's deshielded due to the adjacent ester group.

Now, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 group. But wait, in D, the NH2 is attached directly to the benzene ring. In that case, the NH2 protons would be expected to appear around 2-3 ppm, perhaps? Or would they be more downfield?

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak isn't NH2. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to oxygen, like OCH2, but why is it a broad singlet?

Wait, another approach: Let's analyze the integration. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) suggests an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester. Then, the NMR data would have:

- Ethyl group: 1.20 (t,3H), 4.5 (q,2H).

So that accounts for the ethyl ester group.

The 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) is something else. Maybe it's a methylene group attached to an oxygen or nitrogen. Alternatively, it could be an NH2 group, but the chemical shift seems a bit high for NH2.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2 para to each other. The NH2 is part of the benzene ring, so it's a primary amine attached directly to the ring. The NH2 protons would be expected to appear around 2-4 ppm, possibly. Since they're adjacent to the ring, which is electron-withdrawing, the NH2 would be deshielded and might appear upfield compared to aliphatic amines.

In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2. But why is it a singlet? Wait, the NH2 protons could be exchanging rapidly, causing them to appear as a singlet. Also, in the case of aniline derivatives (NH2 attached to aromatic rings), the NH2 protons are often broad and can appear in the 2-5 ppm region. So a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H fits for an NH2 group.

So putting this together, the NMR would have:

- The ethyl ester: triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).
- The NH2 group: broad singlet at 4.0 (2H).
- The aromatic protons: two doublets, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (2H each), indicating para substitution.

The IR shows strong absorption at 1720 cm-1, which fits with an ester carbonyl. The broad N-H stretches in the IR (3420 and 3325) would correspond to the NH2 group.

Now, looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits all the data.

Another option to consider is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONHPh-OCH2CH3 (substituents at 1 and 4). The formamide group would have a carbonyl at around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group would give triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm. But what about the peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad)? That would need to be the NH group from the formamide. But formamides have a NH group, which is usually a singlet and might appear around 8-9 ppm. However, this doesn't match the 4.0 ppm data. So option B might not fit.

Similarly, option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have a benzamide group (CONH2) and ethoxy. The IR would show an amide carbonyl, but the strong absorption at 1720 is more typical of esters. Also, the NMR would have ethoxy as triplet and quartet. The amide NH2 would be broad, but it's unclear if the 4.0 ppm peak matches. Also, the aromatic substitution would lead to more than two doublets, which doesn't match the given NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would have NH2 and propionate ester. The ester carbonyl would match the IR. The ethyl group (if propionate is ethyl ester) would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group, but the aromatic substitution would again be different. However, the molecular formula for option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C9H11NO2. Let's see:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + propionate (C3H5O2). So 6+3=9 C. H: 5 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (propionate ester: OCH2CH2CH3) → 5+2+5=12? Wait, no. Let me recount: Ph is C6H5, then NH2 is attached to the ring, and the propionate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the propionate ester contributes 3 carbons (from the propionate) and 3 carbons from the ethyl group? Wait, no, the ethyl would be from the ester. Wait, the ester in propionate would be CH2CH2COOEt. So the ester part is OEt, which is CH2CH3. So the propionate would have 3 carbons (CH2CH2COO-) and the ester is OCH2CH3. So the molecule would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2COOEt, where Et is CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5 (Ph) + NH2 (1N, 2H) + COOEt (COOCH2CH3). So C:6 + 2 (COO) +2 (Et) = 10? Wait, no, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, where Et is two carbons. So the propionate (CH2CH2COO-) would be three carbons, plus the ester's two carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's count:

PhNH2COOEt: Ph (C6H5), NH2COOEt is (NH2)(COOCH2CH3). So C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) = 9 C. H:5 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (COOCH2CH3: OCH2CH3 has 5 H, but wait, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the OCH2CH3 has 2 H on OCH2 and 3 on CH3, totaling 5 H. So total H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (COOEt) =12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this doesn't match. So option C is likely incorrect.

So the only option left is D, which has the correct formula and matches all the spectroscopic data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound C9H11NO2 is identified using the provided spectroscopic data:

### IR Analysis:
- A strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester.

- **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
  This compound has an ethoxy group and an amide group. However, the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more consistent with an ester than an amide. Additionally, the NMR data does not fully align with the expected splitting patterns for this structure.

- **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
  This compound contains a formamide group and an ethoxy group. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ could correspond to the formamide carbonyl, but the NH group in formamides typically appears at higher chemical shifts (around 8-9 ppm), which does not match the 4.0 ppm broad singlet observed in the NMR.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see, the IR and NMR data are provided, and I have four options to choose from. I'll take it step by step.

First, the IR data. The strong absorption at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. That's probably a C=O stretch, which is common in amides, esters, or maybe ketones. The medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 likely correspond to N-H or O-H stretches. But looking at the options, I don't see any hydroxyl groups (like in phenols or carboxylic acids), so maybe these are N-H stretches. That makes me think of amides or amines. Wait, the molecular formula has one N, so maybe it's an amide.

Looking at the options:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide has an amide group, so that's a possibility.
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Also an amide.
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: That's an amino group and an ester? Wait, propionate is a carboxylic acid ester. So the molecule would have an NH2 group and an ester.
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: That has an amine and an ester.

Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1750. If it's an amide, the carbonyl is a bit lower, like 1640-1690. Hmm, but I've heard that amides can have higher wavenumbers too. Or maybe it's an acyl chloride, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, but looking at the options, options B and D have ester groups. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a formamide, which has a carbonyl around 1680-1700, so 1720 might be a bit high for an amide but possible. Or maybe it's an ester.

Also, the IR shows N-H stretches. So in the case of an amide, the N-H would be present. If it's an amide, then the stretching would be around 3300-3500. Looking at the options, option A is a benzamide (amide), options B is a formamide (another amide), C is a propionate (ester) with an amine, and D is an ester with an amine.

So, if it's an amide, then options A and B are possible. If it's an ester with an amine, then C and D are possibilities. Let's look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows peaks at:
1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet (t) suggests it's attached to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl group attached somewhere else.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or possibly an NH2 group, but that's usually a broad peak but in what region? Amines can show up around 1-5 ppm, but if it's NH2, it's often a broad peak, but sometimes exchange broadening. But if it's an OCH2, like in an ester, then the OCH2 would be around 3.5-4.5 ppm.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. A quartet suggests it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe a CH2O group next to another CH2. Like OCH2CH2O? Or perhaps an N-CH2-CO? Wait, in an ester, the structure is O-CO-O-ethyl. So the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, so that's the CH2CH3. Then the OCH2 would be around 4-4.5. So in the NMR, the triplet at 1.2 is the ethyl group attached to oxygen. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2.

Wait, but the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2H. So perhaps that's the OCH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but ethyl esters have OCH2CH3. The methyl (CH3) group is a triplet at 1.2, so that's the CH3 of an ethyl group. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3. Wait, but in ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm. So in the data, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H, perhaps that's the OCH2.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is Ph-CO-NH2. But wait, no, the structure would be Ph-CO-NH2 with an OCH2CH3 at position 3. Wait, no, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the amide group at position 1, and the ethoxy at position 3. So the structure is O-CO-NH2 attached to benzene, and an OCH2CH3 at position 3.

But the NMR would show the ethoxy group (CH2CH3) as a triplet. The OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, we have 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Hmm, maybe that's not matching?

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be something else, like NH2? But if it's an amide, the NH2 would be next to the carbonyl. In a primary amide, the NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear around 3-4 ppm. But in the IR, the N-H is around 3300-3400, which matches.

But looking at the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's an NH2, then that might fit. But in that case, the quartet at 4.5 ppm is 2H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group which is split into a quartet. Wait, but it's a quartet in 4.5, so OCH2 would be at 4.5 as a quartet. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Maybe that's the NH2 group.

Wait, but in the options, option A is an amide (so NH2), option B is a formamide, which is HCONHR, so it would have an NH group as well.

Let me think about the aromatic region.

The NMR shows 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Each doublet indicates coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps it's a symmetrical substitution, like two substituents opposite each other. For instance, an ethoxy group and an amide group in para positions.

Wait, but let's think about each option's structure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2COOEt. So the benzoate ester is attached to an amino group in the para position. The benzene would have substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoate would be the amino group at position 4 relative to the COOEt group. So the benzene ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. If substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt) would be equivalent, and the protons in positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOEt) would be another set.

Wait, perhaps the substitution pattern would lead to two doublets, each integrating for 2H. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, like if two substituents are opposite each other, the aromatic protons would be as two sets of doublets.

So let's think about each option's substitution.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The substituents are COOEt and NH2 in para positions. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. So the aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOEt, and the protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOEt.

In such a case, the protons ortho to COOEt (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The meta protons (3 and 5) would be more shielded and appear upfield. So in the NMR, perhaps a doublet around 8 ppm (for the ortho protons) and another around 7 ppm (for the meta protons).

Looking at the NMR data, 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) fit this pattern. So that's a possibility.

But let's check the other options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is PhNH2 with a propiono ester. Hmm, but the formula might not match. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see:

PhNH2 is C6H5NH2. Propionate is C3H5O2. Wait, but in the ester, it's CH2CH2COO- attached to something else. Wait, maybe ethyl propionate is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but here the ester would be OCH2CH3, and the acid part is CH2CH2COOH.

But for option C, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be O=C(O-)OCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, along with NH2. So the molecular formula would be C6H4 (NH2)(COOCH2CH2CH3). Let's count: 6 carbons from benzene, 3 from the propionate, and one from the NH2? Wait, no, benzene is C6, propionate is C3, but the ester is OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, so total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) = 9. Hydrogens: benzene is 5H (since one is substituted), but wait, the benzene in 4-aminophenyl propionate would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the H count: benzene has 4 H in para positions. Let me think. It's getting complicated, but molecular formula is given as C9H11NO2. Let's confirm:

PhNH2 is C6H5NH2: 6 C, 5 H (benzene) + 2 H (NH2) = 7 H. The propiono ester is CH2CH2COOEt? Wait, propionate ester would be (CH2)2COOEt. So the ester group is O-CO-OEt, where Et is CH2CH3.

Wait, the propionate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. So the propionate ester has 3 carbons from the acid and 2 from the ethyl (if ethyl ester), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to count carbons for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2COOEt.

Ph is C6H5, NH2COOEt is C3H5NO2. So total C:6+3=9. H: 5 (Ph) +5 (NH2COOEt? Let me see: NH2 is 2 H, COOEt is OEt (CH2CH3), which has 2 H on O and 5 H from CH2CH3? Wait, wait, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the ester group is OCH2CH3, which has 2 H (CH2) and 3 H (CH3), but in the structure, the OCH2CH3 would have 2 H on the CH2 and 3 on the CH3. So the molecule's H count: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, COOEt and NH2 are para), and the ester group contributes 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 2 and 3 H). Plus the NH2 has 2 H. So total H:4 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +2 (NH2) =11. That matches the formula C9H11NO2.

Option D's formula is correct.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: O-CO-NH2 attached to benzene, with OCH2CH3 at position 3. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 1 (CO-NH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3). So the aromatic protons would be a bit more complex. The protons ortho to CO-NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, while those meta would be more shielded. But in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions, making the aromatic Hs a bit more complex. The NMR would show more than two sets of protons, perhaps, unless it's symmetrical. Wait, but in the given data, there are only two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which suggests a para-substitution pattern. So maybe option A is not the correct structure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONHPh-OCH2CH3, where the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide group) and 4 (ethoxy). So the benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the aromatic protons similar to option D but with different substituents. The aromatic protons would again be two doublets, each 2H, which fits the data. So the NMR would have 7.0 and 8.0 ppm regions as doublets.

Looking at the NMR shifts, the formamide group (HCONHR) would have the carbonyl around 1720, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would have triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5.

But what about the other peaks. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) in the NMR: what is that? If it's an NH group, perhaps. But formamide has a NH group. Wait, formamide is HCONHR. So the NH would be a singlet or a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the NH in formamide would be around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, maybe.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The 4.0 ppm peak in the NMR is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be the NH2 group from an amide? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, looking back at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t,3H) → ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → could be NH2? But NH2 protons are usually broader and appear around 1-5 ppm. If it's NH2 in an amide, it would be a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but why would OCH2 be a broad singlet? OCH2 is usually a quartet or triplet.

Wait, in option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is PhNH2COOEt. So the NH2 group would be in the ortho position relative to the COOEt. The NH2 protons would be split by the adjacent carbonyl group but would appear in the NMR as a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2 group.

But wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H, which would correspond to the OCH2 in the ethyl ester. Let me think about the splitting. The OCH2 group in ethyl ester is connected to the O of the carbonyl. The OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet (since it's next to CH3, which has 3 H). The CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2 ppm, which matches the data.

So the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet, but in the data, it's at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, that's a bit higher than I'd expect. Maybe it's deshielded due to the adjacent ester group.

Now, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 group. But wait, in D, the NH2 is attached directly to the benzene ring. In that case, the NH2 protons would be expected to appear around 2-3 ppm, perhaps? Or would they be more downfield?

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak isn't NH2. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to oxygen, like OCH2, but why is it a broad singlet?

Wait, another approach: Let's analyze the integration. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) suggests an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester. Then, the NMR data would have:

- Ethyl group: 1.20 (t,3H), 4.5 (q,2H).

So that accounts for the ethyl ester group.

The 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) is something else. Maybe it's a methylene group attached to an oxygen or nitrogen. Alternatively, it could be an NH2 group, but the chemical shift seems a bit high for NH2.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2 para to each other. The NH2 is part of the benzene ring, so it's a primary amine attached directly to the ring. The NH2 protons would be expected to appear around 2-4 ppm, possibly. Since they're adjacent to the ring, which is electron-withdrawing, the NH2 would be deshielded and might appear upfield compared to aliphatic amines.

In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2. But why is it a singlet? Wait, the NH2 protons could be exchanging rapidly, causing them to appear as a singlet. Also, in the case of aniline derivatives (NH2 attached to aromatic rings), the NH2 protons are often broad and can appear in the 2-5 ppm region. So a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H fits for an NH2 group.

So putting this together, the NMR would have:

- The ethyl ester: triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).
- The NH2 group: broad singlet at 4.0 (2H).
- The aromatic protons: two doublets, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (2H each), indicating para substitution.

The IR shows strong absorption at 1720 cm-1, which fits with an ester carbonyl. The broad N-H stretches in the IR (3420 and 3325) would correspond to the NH2 group.

Now, looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits all the data.

Another option to consider is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONHPh-OCH2CH3 (substituents at 1 and 4). The formamide group would have a carbonyl at around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group would give triplet at 1.2 ppm and quartet at 4.5 ppm. But what about the peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad)? That would need to be the NH group from the formamide. But formamides have a NH group, which is usually a singlet and might appear around 8-9 ppm. However, this doesn't match the 4.0 ppm data. So option B might not fit.

Similarly, option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have a benzamide group (CONH2) and ethoxy. The IR would show an amide carbonyl, but the strong absorption at 1720 is more typical of esters. Also, the NMR would have ethoxy as triplet and quartet. The amide NH2 would be broad, but it's unclear if the 4.0 ppm peak matches. Also, the aromatic substitution would lead to more than two doublets, which doesn't match the given NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would have NH2 and propionate ester. The ester carbonyl would match the IR. The ethyl group (if propionate is ethyl ester) would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group, but the aromatic substitution would again be different. However, the molecular formula for option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C9H11NO2. Let's see:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + propionate (C3H5O2). So 6+3=9 C. H: 5 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (propionate ester: OCH2CH2CH3) → 5+2+5=12? Wait, no. Let me recount: Ph is C6H5, then NH2 is attached to the ring, and the propionate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the propionate ester contributes 3 carbons (from the propionate) and 3 carbons from the ethyl group? Wait, no, the ethyl would be from the ester. Wait, the ester in propionate would be CH2CH2COOEt. So the ester part is OEt, which is CH2CH3. So the propionate would have 3 carbons (CH2CH2COO-) and the ester is OCH2CH3. So the molecule would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2COOEt, where Et is CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5 (Ph) + NH2 (1N, 2H) + COOEt (COOCH2CH3). So C:6 + 2 (COO) +2 (Et) = 10? Wait, no, COOEt is O-CO-OEt, where Et is two carbons. So the propionate (CH2CH2COO-) would be three carbons, plus the ester's two carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's count:

PhNH2COOEt: Ph (C6H5), NH2COOEt is (NH2)(COOCH2CH3). So C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) = 9 C. H:5 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (COOCH2CH3: OCH2CH3 has 5 H, but wait, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the OCH2CH3 has 2 H on OCH2 and 3 on CH3, totaling 5 H. So total H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (COOEt) =12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this doesn't match. So option C is likely incorrect.

So the only option left is D, which has the correct formula and matches all the spectroscopic data.
