Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator given. Let's see... The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by the components of n. Oh wait, no, actually, σ · n would be the sum of each σ_i multiplied by n_i, right?

So the question is about finding the eigenvalues of this H. I remember that when you have a Pauli matrix multiplied by a unit vector, the eigenvalues relate to the magnitude. Wait, Pauli matrices individually have eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a Hamiltonian like this, which is a dot product of σ and some vector, it's like a spin operator in that direction.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, so any linear combination of them would also be a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of such a matrix should be something related to the coefficients. Oh, right! The trace of the matrix is the sum of eigenvalues, and determinant is the product. But more importantly, for any matrix of the form a·σ (where a is a vector), the eigenvalues should be ±|a|. But wait, wait, in this case, the coefficient is ε and the unit vector... so let's think carefully.

The Hamiltonian H is ε times the sum of σ_i n_i. So H = ε (σ · n). Now, the operator σ · n is a vector in the Pauli matrices, and because n is a unit vector, the magnitude of σ · n is 1 (since each σ is a matrix but the sum would have a magnitude squared of 1). So when you multiply by ε, the magnitude of H becomes ε.

But wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1, right? Because the eigenvalues of σ · n are the eigenvalues of the spin operator in that direction, which are ±ħ/2 for spin-½ particles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused here because sometimes in spin systems, the Pauli matrices are scaled with ħ/2. Let me think.

In the standard spin-½ system, the spin operator S is given by S = (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2. So if H = ε σ · n, maybe the eigenvalues are scaled by ε times that.

Wait, let's go step by step. The operator σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, because σ · n is a traceless matrix (since n is a unit vector and the trace of σ ·n is 0). The trace is the sum of eigenvalues, so they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. The determinant would be - (1)(1) = -1? Wait, no, because the identity matrix has determinant 1, but σ ·n is not the identity. Let me compute the eigenvalues of σ ·n.

Alternatively, I can note that (σ ·n)^2 is equal to the identity matrix. Because (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y +n_z σ_z)^2. Each σ_i squared is identity, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i. Wait, but when you square, each σ_i term is multiplied by n_i, and the square would be n_i^2 σ_i^2 plus cross terms. Wait, but for a unit vector n, sum n_i^2 =1. So (σ ·n)^2 = σ_x^2 n_x^2 + σ_y^2 n_y^2 + σ_z^2 n_z^2 + 2 (n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z )

But wait, σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k when i≠j, and σ_i^2 = I when i=j. So when we compute (σ ·n)^2, the cross terms would involve σ_i σ_j terms. But let me see, perhaps a better approach is to note that σ ·n is a Hermitian matrix, as it's a linear combination of Hermitian matrices (Pauli matrices are Hermitian). So its eigenvalues are real.

The square of σ ·n is (σ ·n)^2. Let me compute this. Since σ ·n is a vector in the space of 2x2 matrices, and the square would be I (identity matrix) because (σ ·n)^2 = I. Because for any unit vector n, (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding, each σ_i squared is I, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i for i≠j. But σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I, because σ_i and σ_j anti-commute when i≠j. Wait, no, wait. Wait, σ_i and σ_j anti-commute, so σ_i σ_j = - σ_j σ_i. So when you add them, σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 0. So the cross terms vanish. So (σ ·n)^2 = sum (n_i^2 σ_i^2 ) = sum (n_i^2 I ) = I, since sum n_i^2 =1.

So (σ ·n)^2 = I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ ·n must satisfy (λ)^2 =1, so λ = ±1. So the eigenvalues of σ ·n are +1 and -1.

Now, the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by σ ·n. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ ·n. So the eigenvalues are ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which gives eigenvalues of ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. Option C is ± ε ħ/2. Which one is correct?

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused again. Because sometimes Pauli matrices are used in the context of spin, where they are multiplied by ħ/2. Let me think. The Pauli matrices σ are often used in the expression S = (ħ/2) σ. So for the spin operator, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H= ε σ ·n. So if ε has units of energy, perhaps the units of H are correct.

Wait, let's think about units. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless because they are matrices (just like the identity matrix). So σ ·n is dimensionless. Therefore, ε must have units of energy, and H would have units of energy. So the eigenvalues are ε times ±1, which are ±ε, which would have units of energy.

But if the Hamiltonian H is ε σ ·n, and each Pauli matrix is dimensionless, then the eigenvalues are ε*(±1), so ±ε. So the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: sometimes when you have spin in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator. For example, H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator. Then the eigenvalues would be ± (γ B ħ/2). But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is just ε σ ·n, which is similar to that scenario if γ B is ε. So the eigenvalues would be ± ε (something). But in this case, since σ is used, perhaps the eigenvalues are ± ε.

Alternatively, if the Hamiltonian were written as ε (σ ·n) /2, then the eigenvalues would be ± ε/2. But in this problem, it's just ε (σ ·n), so the eigenvalues are ± ε. So option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with units of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \( H \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \). Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a traceless \( 2 \times 2 \) Hermitian matrix. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation. Notably, \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is simply \( \varepsilon \) times \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), which are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues must have units of energy, and \( \pm 1 \) does not include \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as shown above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect unless there is an implicit factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in the definition of \( \vec{\sigma} \), which is not stated in the problem.
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not include \( \varepsilon \), which is explicitly part of the Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).
