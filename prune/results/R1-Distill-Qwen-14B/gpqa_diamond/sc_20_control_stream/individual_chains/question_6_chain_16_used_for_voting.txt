Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's helpful to look for separability. The particle is in a central potential plus some angular component, but wait, in this case, the potential depends on θ as well. Oh, right, because there's a cos²θ term. So it's not a purely radial problem anymore. 

Wait, but wait a minute. The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor that. Maybe I can reorganize it. Let's see: (1/2)kr² is just a simple harmonic oscillator term in r. But the other part is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So, maybe I can write it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Hmm, that doesn't look standard. Alternatively, maybe I can split it into terms that depend on r and terms that depend on θ. Wait, but the potential isn't just a sum of a function of r and a function of θ. Because both terms have kr², so it's [ (1/2) + 3/2 cos²θ ] multiplied by kr². So V(r,θ) = kr² ( (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) ) = (kr²)( (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 ). 

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about the potential in terms of angular momentum or other quantum numbers. Alternatively, perhaps we can transform the problem into an effective potential by considering the angular parts.

Wait, in two dimensions, the coordinates are r and θ. The Hamiltonian is usually expressed in polar coordinates, which includes a term for the angular part. The Hamiltonian H is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r, θ).

So substituting the given V(r,θ), H becomes [p_r²/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²)] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ.

Wait, that's (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = k r² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, but then the potential is not spherically symmetric. So the problem is not separable into radial and angular parts in the usual way because of the cos²θ dependence. That complicates things. I'm not sure how to handle this.

Wait a second, maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of cos(2θ) because cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's try that.

So 3/2 cos²θ = (3/2)( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) = 3/4 (1 + cos 2θ ). So the potential becomes (1/2)kr² + 3/4 kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. That simplifies to (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, so V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. The presence of cos2θ makes me think about perturbation or perhaps a shift in the angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps there's a coordinate transformation that can make this separable.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of a shifted angle or something. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that cos2θ suggests a dependence on the angular momentum in a certain way.

Wait, the kinetic energy in polar coordinates has a term (p_θ)^2/(2m r²). The angular part of the Hamiltonian is (p_θ)^2/(2m r²), which is like an angular momentum term. Let me recall that p_θ = m r² dθ/dt, so angular momentum L is m r² ω = m r² dθ/dt = p_θ. So, L = p_θ. Therefore, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is L²/(2m r²).

So, the total Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (L²)/(2 m r²) + (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, now, the potential has a cos2θ term, which can be written in terms of L. Because cos2θ is related to the angle, but perhaps using spherical harmonics or ladder operators. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the cos2θ term as a perturbation.

Wait, but maybe we can find an effective potential by combining the angular part of the Hamiltonian and the potential's angular terms. So, the angular part of H is (L²)/(2 m r²) + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to handle that. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution for the angular variable. Let me think about the potential in terms of the angle. Let me consider the angular part.

Wait, the potential V has terms that depend on cos2θ. Maybe the problem can be transformed by substituting φ = 2θ. Then, the potential would have a cosφ term. But I'm not sure if that helps in the separation of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the potential as a perturbation. But the potential here is not small, so that might not be the right approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operator. Let's remember that in polar coordinates, the angular part of the Laplacian is (1/r²) d²/dθ² + (cosθ / r²) d/dθ. But I'm not sure how that directly helps here.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to consider that the potential is part of an oscillator. The first term is (1/2)kr², which is like a harmonic oscillator, and the second term (3/2 kr² cos²θ) is an anisotropic term. Wait, because in two dimensions, if the potential is like (mω² r²)/2, but if it's dependent on θ, it's like having a different frequency in different directions.

Wait, let me think. In two dimensions, a potential like V(r) = (1/2)k r² is isotropic, leading to a simple harmonic oscillator in 2D, which has energy levels E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). But when the potential is anisotropic, like V(r) = (1/2)k_x x² + (1/2)k_y y², then the energy is E = (n_x + n_y +1 ) ℏ (sqrt(k_x/m), sqrt(k_y/m)), but that's when the potential depends on x and y separately.

In this problem, the potential depends on r and cosθ, which complicates things. Maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of x and y coordinates. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. Therefore, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²)/(r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute that again. cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x² / r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

So, the potential becomes V(r, x) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k x².

Wait, but r² = x² + y². So, substituting, V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2) k x².

That simplifies to V = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2 k) y². Let's compute the coefficients: (1/2 + 3/2) = 2, so V = 2k x² + (1/2 k) y².

Oh, so the potential is separable in x and y! So now the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2 k) y².

Ah, that makes things much easier. So the problem is effectively a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. So, the potential is (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y², where ω_x² = (4k)/m and ω_y² = (k)/m. Wait, let me think. The standard form is V = (1/2) m ω² x². So, our potential is 2k x² = (1/2 m ω_x²) x², so ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, (1/2 m ω_y²) y² = (1/2 k) y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So, we have a 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x and ω_y in x and y directions respectively.

In such a case, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω, where ω is the average of the two frequencies? Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the energy in each direction is quantized separately.

In a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator where the potential is V(x) = (1/2) m ω_x² x² and V(y) = (1/2) m ω_y² y², the energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So, in our case, ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So, the energy becomes E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y +1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Simplify that: E = (2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)) ) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which is E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 ) ) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1. And (n_y +1/2) is n_y +0.5. Adding them gives 2n_x + n_y + 1.5. So E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Which matches what I just found.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Simplification**:  
   The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos\theta = x/r \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]  
   Since \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential simplifies to:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

2. **Energy Levels in 2D Harmonic Oscillator**:  
   For a 2D harmonic oscillator with potential \( V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2x^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2y^2 \), the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y,
   \]  
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers, and \( \omega_x = \sqrt{k/m} \), \( \omega_y = \sqrt{k/m} \) are the angular frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.

3. **Substituting Frequencies**:  
   From the potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the frequencies are:  
   \[
   \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Substituting these into the energy formula:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about the potential in terms of angular momentum or other quantum numbers. Alternatively, perhaps we can transform the problem into an effective potential by considering the angular parts.

Wait, in two dimensions, the coordinates are r and θ. The Hamiltonian is usually expressed in polar coordinates, which includes a term for the angular part. The Hamiltonian H is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r, θ).

So substituting the given V(r,θ), H becomes [p_r²/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²)] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ.

Wait, that's (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = k r² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, but then the potential is not spherically symmetric. So the problem is not separable into radial and angular parts in the usual way because of the cos²θ dependence. That complicates things. I'm not sure how to handle this.

Wait a second, maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of cos(2θ) because cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's try that.

So 3/2 cos²θ = (3/2)( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) = 3/4 (1 + cos 2θ ). So the potential becomes (1/2)kr² + 3/4 kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. That simplifies to (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, so V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. The presence of cos2θ makes me think about perturbation or perhaps a shift in the angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps there's a coordinate transformation that can make this separable.

Let me recall that p_θ = m r² dθ/dt, so angular momentum L is m r² ω = m r² dθ/dt = p_θ. So, L = p_θ. Therefore, the angular part of the Hamiltonian is L²/(2m r²).

So, the total Hamiltonian is:

H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (L²)/(2 m r²) + (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, now, the potential has a cos2θ term, which can be written in terms of L. Because cos2θ is related to the angle, but perhaps using spherical harmonics or ladder operators. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the cos2θ term as a perturbation.

Wait, but maybe we can find an effective potential by combining the angular part of the Hamiltonian and the potential's angular terms. So, the angular part of H is (L²)/(2 m r²) + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to handle that. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution for the angular variable. Let me think about the potential in terms of the angle. Let me consider the angular part.

Wait, the potential V has terms that depend on cos2θ. Maybe the problem can be transformed by substituting φ = 2θ. Then, the potential would have a cosφ term. But I'm not sure if that helps in the separation of variables.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum operator. Let's remember that in polar coordinates, the angular part of the Laplacian is (1/r²) d²/dθ² + (cosθ / r²) d/dθ. But I'm not sure how that directly helps here.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to consider that the potential is part of an oscillator. The first term is (1/2)kr², which is like a harmonic oscillator, and the second term (3/2 kr² cos²θ) is an anisotropic term. Wait, because in two dimensions, if the potential is like (mω² r²)/2, but if it's dependent on θ, it's like having a different frequency in different directions.

Wait, let me think. In two dimensions, a potential like V(r) = (1/2)k r² is isotropic, leading to a simple harmonic oscillator in 2D, which has energy levels E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). But when the potential is anisotropic, like V(r) = (1/2)k_x x² + (1/2)k_y y², then the energy is E = (n_x + n_y +1 ) ℏ (sqrt(k_x/m), sqrt(k_y/m)), but that's when the potential depends on x and y separately.

In this problem, the potential depends on r and cosθ, which complicates things. Maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of x and y coordinates. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. Therefore, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²)/(r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute that again. cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x² / r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

So, the potential becomes V(r, x) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k x².

Wait, but r² = x² + y². So, substituting, V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2) k x².

That simplifies to V = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2 k) y². Let's compute the coefficients: (1/2 + 3/2) = 2, so V = 2k x² + (1/2 k) y².

Oh, so the potential is separable in x and y! So now the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2 k) y².

Ah, that makes things much easier. So the problem is effectively a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. So, the potential is (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y², where ω_x² = (4k)/m and ω_y² = (k)/m. Wait, let me think. The standard form is V = (1/2) m ω² x². So, our potential is 2k x² = (1/2 m ω_x²) x², so ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, (1/2 m ω_y²) y² = (1/2 k) y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So, we have a 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x and ω_y in x and y directions respectively.

In such a case, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω, where ω is the average of the two frequencies? Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the energy in each direction is quantized separately.

In a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator where the potential is V(x) = (1/2) m ω_x² x² and V(y) = (1/2) m ω_y² y², the energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So, in our case, ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So, the energy becomes E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y +1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Simplify that: E = (2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)) ) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which is E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 ) ) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1. And (n_y +1/2) is n_y +0.5. Adding them gives 2n_x + n_y + 1.5. So E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Which matches what I just found.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Simplification**:  
   The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos\theta = x/r \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]  
   Since \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential simplifies to:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

2. **Energy Levels in 2D Harmonic Oscillator**:  
   For a 2D harmonic oscillator with potential \( V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2x^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2y^2 \), the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y,
   \]  
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers, and \( \omega_x = \sqrt{k/m} \), \( \omega_y = \sqrt{k/m} \) are the angular frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.

3. **Substituting Frequencies**:  
   From the potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the frequencies are:  
   \[
   \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Substituting these into the energy formula:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
