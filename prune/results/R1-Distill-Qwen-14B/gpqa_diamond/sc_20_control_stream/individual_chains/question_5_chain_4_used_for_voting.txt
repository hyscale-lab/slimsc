Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, an eigenvector of an operator corresponds to a state with a definite value (eigenvalue) when measured. So here, the operator is P, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because directions in space can be represented as unit vectors. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, meaning it's in the form (nx, 0, nz), since the y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Or perhaps (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? I'm a bit confused here, but I think the exact parametrization might not matter right now since the problem is about the eigenvector in this direction.

The operator P is given, but not directly. Instead, it's given in terms of its components along x, y, and z. So P is a vector operator, and we're looking for the eigenvector when P is measured along direction n. So I think the operator we're considering is P·n, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P and the unit vector n.

So the operator we're interested in is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Now, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is an operator, and when you take their linear combination, you get the operator along direction n. Let's compute P·n.

P·n = (ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Wait, because n_x is sinθ (assuming n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) ), but maybe it's better to just keep it as n_x and n_z for now.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ].

Because let's compute the sum:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

We are to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

(P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So the matrix equation is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z * ψ₁ + n_x * ψ₂ = ψ₁
n_x * ψ₁ - n_z * ψ₂ = ψ₂

Let me write this as:

(n_z - 1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0
n_x ψ₁ + (-n_z -1) ψ₂ = 0

Wait, no. Let me rearrange each equation:

First equation:
n_z ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = ψ₁ → (n_z -1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → Equation 1.

Second equation:
n_x ψ₁ - n_z ψ₂ = ψ₂ → n_x ψ₁ - (n_z +1) ψ₂ = 0 → Equation 2.

So now I have two equations:

1) (n_z -1)ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0
2) n_x ψ₁ - (n_z +1) ψ₂ = 0

I can treat these as a system of linear equations. For a non-trivial solution (non-zero ψ vectors), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, I can express one variable in terms of the other.

From Equation 1:
(n_z -1)ψ₁ = -n_x ψ₂ → ψ₁ = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] ψ₂

Wait, but I can also look for ratios. Let me express ψ₁ in terms of ψ₂.

So ψ₁ = [ (-n_x) / (n_z -1) ) ] * ψ₂.

But perhaps it's easier to set ψ₂ = 1 (or some normalization) and express ψ₁ accordingly. Alternatively, I can find the ratio ψ₁/ψ₂.

Let me denote the ratio r = ψ₁/ψ₂. Then ψ₁ = r ψ₂.

Substituting into Equation 1:

(n_z -1) r ψ₂ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → [ (n_z -1) r + n_x ] ψ₂ = 0.

Since ψ₂ can't be zero (otherwise ψ is trivial), we have:

(n_z -1) r + n_x = 0 → r = -n_x/(n_z -1)

Similarly, from Equation 2:

n_x r ψ₂ - (n_z +1) ψ₂ = 0 → [n_x r - (n_z +1)] ψ₂ = 0 → n_x r = n_z +1

Substituting r from above:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) ) ] = n_z +1

Let me compute that:

n_x * (-n_x) / (n_z -1) ) = n_z +1

So:

- n_x² / (n_z -1) ) = n_z +1 → Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x² = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) → -n_x^2 = n_z² -1 → n_z² -1 +n_x^2 =0 → n_z² +n_x^2 =1.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1, right? Because in the x-z plane, the components satisfy that. So the equation holds. So the two equations are consistent.

So from the ratio r = ψ₁/ψ₂ = (-n_x)/(n_z -1)

But I need to express the eigenvector components. Let's write ψ = [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T = [ r ψ₂, ψ₂ ]^T.

So to find the eigenvector, I can express ψ in terms of r. Let's choose ψ₂ =1 for simplicity, then ψ₁ = r.

So ψ = [ r, 1 ].

But let's plug in r from above: r = (-n_x)/(n_z -1)

So ψ = [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1), 1 ]

But wait, perhaps another approach is better. Because the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector, so after finding the general form, I can normalize it.

Wait, but perhaps we can find an explicit form in terms of the angles. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, let me parametrize it using an angle θ from the z-axis. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into the ratio:

r = ( - sinθ ) / ( cosθ -1 )

Hmm, so ψ₁ = r * ψ₂, and we can set ψ₂ =1.

Wait, but this might get messy. Let me see if I can find a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the eigenstates of spin in an arbitrary direction.

Wait, wait a second. I'm dealing with a spin-½ system, since the matrices are 2x2. Spin operators are usually represented as S_x, S_y, S_z, and the eigenstates are spin-up or spin-down along a given direction.

The eigenstates of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. So the eigenvectors can be found using the eigenstates of the spin along n.

Hmm, but perhaps using the eigenstate formula for spin in an arbitrary direction. I remember that for spin-½, the eigenstates can be written using the angles θ and φ as:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |1>
|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + cos(θ/2) |1>

But wait, that's when the direction is parametrized as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, so φ is zero. Because the n vector is (n_x, 0, n_z), so φ=0.

Alternatively, in some conventions, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is in the x-y plane. Since our direction is in x-z, φ is zero.

So for our case, the spin-up state along n would be:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + sin(θ/2) |1>

Wait, because when φ=0, e^{iφ}=1, so the second term is just sin(θ/2). Similarly, the spin-down would be:

|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + cos(θ/2) |1>

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. The standard parametrization for the spin-up state along a direction n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |0> + e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) |1>

But in our case, φ=0, so this simplifies to:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + sin(θ/2) |1>

Similarly, the spin-down state would have a negative imaginary component:

|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + cos(θ/2) |1>

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake. Because I think the general form also has some exponential factors, but when φ is zero, those factors become 1, so it's just cos and sin terms.

But wait, looking back at the options, I see that option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have for |+>, but without any i factors. So option C is a possible candidate. But let me see.

Wait, but the problem states that the operator is P, which is a spin operator, so the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n, which are as I wrote.

But let me think again. The problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is the maximum eigenvalue for spin-½. So the eigenvector should correspond to the spin-up state along n.

So the eigenvector components, in the basis of the z-spin, would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me check. Because when n is along z (theta=0), the spin-up state is [1, 0], which matches cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. If n is along x (theta=90 degrees), then cos(45)=√2/2, sin(45)=√2/2, so the state is [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct for spin-up along x.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's not normalized. Wait, no, wait; in option C, the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So that eigenvector is correct.

But looking at the options, option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)). Wait, but our analysis doesn't involve hbar in the components of the eigenvector. Wait, in the problem statement, the operator P is given with factors of ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are just the state vectors, which are dimensionless.

Wait, but in the options, some have hbar factors, like option A has sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. Hmm, that's confusing because eigenvectors are typically unit vectors, so they shouldn't have hbar units. So perhaps those options are incorrect.

Wait, looking at the eigenvectors we derived, the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C. But I should check the other options.

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). That looks more like the spherical harmonics, but perhaps not the right parametrization for a spin-½ state. Option D has hbar factors, which seems odd because eigenvectors shouldn't have units. So I'm thinking option C is the right choice.

Wait, but let me think again. How do the eigenvectors look in terms of the matrix I derived earlier?

I have the matrix for P·n as (ħ/2) multiplied by [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

So the eigenvalues of this matrix are (ħ/2)(±1), because the matrix is (ħ/2)[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. The trace is zero, and the determinant is -(ħ/2)^2 (n_z² +n_x²) = -(ħ/2)^2 (1 - n_x²) since n_x² +n_z² =1. Wait, no, n_x² + n_z² =1, so determinant is (ħ/2)^2 * (n_z * (-n_z) ) - (n_x)^2 = (ħ/2)^2 ( -n_z² -n_x² ). Which is (ħ/2)^2 (-1) (n_z² +n_x^2 ) = - (ħ/2)^2. So the determinant is - (ħ/2)^2. Then the eigenvalues are [ trace ± sqrt(trace² -4 determinant) ] / 2. But trace is zero, so eigenvalues are ± sqrt( -4 determinant ) /2. Determinant is - (ħ/2)^2 → -4 determinant is 4 (ħ/2)^2 → sqrt(4 (ħ/2)^2 ) = 2*(ħ/2) ) = ħ. So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which matches the given eigenvalue.

So the eigenvectors are found by solving (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> =0. Which brings us back to the same equations as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should re-examine the eigenvector components. Let me take a specific case to see what the eigenvector looks like.

For example, if n is along z (theta=0), then n_x=0, n_z=1.

Then the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the eigenvector [1,0], which in our parametrization would be cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) with theta=0, giving [1,0], which is correct.

If n is along x (theta=90 degrees), then n_x=1, n_z=0.

The matrix becomes (ħ/2) [[0,1], [1, 0]], whose eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1,1]/sqrt(2), because the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and the eigenvectors would be [1,1] and [1,-1], normalized.

In our parametrization, theta=90, so theta/2=45 degrees. cos(45)=√2/2, sin(45)=√2/2. So the eigenvector becomes [√2/2, √2/2], which is [1,1]/√2, which matches. So this case works, and our parametrization is correct.

Therefore, the eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator along the arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, since $n_y = 0$. Substituting the given components of $\vec{P}$, the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle,
\]

where $|\psi\rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)\psi_1 + n_x \psi_2 = 0, \quad n_x \psi_1 - (n_z + 1)\psi_2 = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, the ratio of the components of the eigenvector is found to be:

\[
\frac{\psi_1}{\psi_2} = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1}.
\]

To express the eigenvector in terms of $\theta$, we use the parametrization $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting these into the ratio, the eigenvector components become:

\[
\psi_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad \psi_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

This matches the standard parametrization of the spin-up eigenstate along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is inconsistent with the spin-½ eigenstate parametrization for $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector components and is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, an eigenvector of an operator corresponds to a state with a definite value (eigenvalue) when measured. So here, the operator is P, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because directions in space can be represented as unit vectors. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, meaning it's in the form (nx, 0, nz), since the y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Or perhaps (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? I'm a bit confused here, but I think the exact parametrization might not matter right now since the problem is about the eigenvector in this direction.

The operator P is given, but not directly. Instead, it's given in terms of its components along x, y, and z. So P is a vector operator, and we're looking for the eigenvector when P is measured along direction n. So I think the operator we're considering is P·n, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P and the unit vector n.

So the operator we're interested in is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Now, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is an operator, and when you take their linear combination, you get the operator along direction n. Let's compute P·n.

P·n = (ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Wait, because n_x is sinθ (assuming n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) ), but maybe it's better to just keep it as n_x and n_z for now.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ].

Because let's compute the sum:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

We are to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

(P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So the matrix equation is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z * ψ₁ + n_x * ψ₂ = ψ₁
n_x * ψ₁ - n_z * ψ₂ = ψ₂

Let me write this as:

(n_z - 1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0
n_x ψ₁ + (-n_z -1) ψ₂ = 0

Wait, no. Let me rearrange each equation:

First equation:
n_z ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = ψ₁ → (n_z -1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → Equation 1.

Second equation:
n_x ψ₁ - n_z ψ₂ = ψ₂ → n_x ψ₁ - (n_z +1) ψ₂ = 0 → Equation 2.

So now I have two equations:

1) (n_z -1)ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0
2) n_x ψ₁ - (n_z +1) ψ₂ = 0

I can treat these as a system of linear equations. For a non-trivial solution (non-zero ψ vectors), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, I can express one variable in terms of the other.

From Equation 1:
(n_z -1)ψ₁ = -n_x ψ₂ → ψ₁ = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] ψ₂

Wait, but I can also look for ratios. Let me express ψ₁ in terms of ψ₂.

So ψ₁ = [ (-n_x) / (n_z -1) ) ] * ψ₂.

But perhaps it's easier to set ψ₂ = 1 (or some normalization) and express ψ₁ accordingly. Alternatively, I can find the ratio ψ₁/ψ₂.

Let me denote the ratio r = ψ₁/ψ₂. Then ψ₁ = r ψ₂.

Substituting into Equation 1:

(n_z -1) r ψ₂ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → [ (n_z -1) r + n_x ] ψ₂ = 0.

Since ψ₂ can't be zero (otherwise ψ is trivial), we have:

(n_z -1) r + n_x = 0 → r = -n_x/(n_z -1)

Similarly, from Equation 2:

n_x r ψ₂ - (n_z +1) ψ₂ = 0 → [n_x r - (n_z +1)] ψ₂ = 0 → n_x r = n_z +1

Substituting r from above:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) ) ] = n_z +1

Let me compute that:

n_x * (-n_x) / (n_z -1) ) = n_z +1

So:

- n_x² / (n_z -1) ) = n_z +1 → Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x² = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) → -n_x^2 = n_z² -1 → n_z² -1 +n_x^2 =0 → n_z² +n_x^2 =1.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1, right? Because in the x-z plane, the components satisfy that. So the equation holds. So the two equations are consistent.

So from the ratio r = ψ₁/ψ₂ = (-n_x)/(n_z -1)

But I need to express the eigenvector components. Let's write ψ = [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T = [ r ψ₂, ψ₂ ]^T.

So to find the eigenvector, I can express ψ in terms of r. Let's choose ψ₂ =1 for simplicity, then ψ₁ = r.

So ψ = [ r, 1 ].

But let's plug in r from above: r = (-n_x)/(n_z -1)

So ψ = [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1), 1 ]

But wait, perhaps another approach is better. Because the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector, so after finding the general form, I can normalize it.

Wait, but perhaps we can find an explicit form in terms of the angles. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, let me parametrize it using an angle θ from the z-axis. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into the ratio:

r = ( - sinθ ) / ( cosθ -1 )

Hmm, so ψ₁ = r * ψ₂, and we can set ψ₂ =1.

Wait, but this might get messy. Let me see if I can find a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the eigenstates of spin in an arbitrary direction.

Wait, wait a second. I'm dealing with a spin-½ system, since the matrices are 2x2. Spin operators are usually represented as S_x, S_y, S_z, and the eigenstates are spin-up or spin-down along a given direction.

The eigenstates of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. So the eigenvectors can be found using the eigenstates of the spin along n.

Hmm, but perhaps using the eigenstate formula for spin in an arbitrary direction. I remember that for spin-½, the eigenstates can be written using the angles θ and φ as:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |1>
|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + cos(θ/2) |1>

But wait, that's when the direction is parametrized as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, so φ is zero. Because the n vector is (n_x, 0, n_z), so φ=0.

Alternatively, in some conventions, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is in the x-y plane. Since our direction is in x-z, φ is zero.

So for our case, the spin-up state along n would be:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + sin(θ/2) |1>

Wait, because when φ=0, e^{iφ}=1, so the second term is just sin(θ/2). Similarly, the spin-down would be:

|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + cos(θ/2) |1>

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. The standard parametrization for the spin-up state along a direction n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |0> + e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) |1>

But in our case, φ=0, so this simplifies to:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + sin(θ/2) |1>

Similarly, the spin-down state would have a negative imaginary component:

|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + cos(θ/2) |1>

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake. Because I think the general form also has some exponential factors, but when φ is zero, those factors become 1, so it's just cos and sin terms.

But wait, looking back at the options, I see that option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have for |+>, but without any i factors. So option C is a possible candidate. But let me see.

Wait, but the problem states that the operator is P, which is a spin operator, so the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n, which are as I wrote.

But let me think again. The problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is the maximum eigenvalue for spin-½. So the eigenvector should correspond to the spin-up state along n.

So the eigenvector components, in the basis of the z-spin, would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me check. Because when n is along z (theta=0), the spin-up state is [1, 0], which matches cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. If n is along x (theta=90 degrees), then cos(45)=√2/2, sin(45)=√2/2, so the state is [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct for spin-up along x.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's not normalized. Wait, no, wait; in option C, the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So that eigenvector is correct.

But looking at the options, option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)). Wait, but our analysis doesn't involve hbar in the components of the eigenvector. Wait, in the problem statement, the operator P is given with factors of ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are just the state vectors, which are dimensionless.

Wait, but in the options, some have hbar factors, like option A has sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. Hmm, that's confusing because eigenvectors are typically unit vectors, so they shouldn't have hbar units. So perhaps those options are incorrect.

Wait, looking at the eigenvectors we derived, the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C. But I should check the other options.

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). That looks more like the spherical harmonics, but perhaps not the right parametrization for a spin-½ state. Option D has hbar factors, which seems odd because eigenvectors shouldn't have units. So I'm thinking option C is the right choice.

Wait, but let me think again. How do the eigenvectors look in terms of the matrix I derived earlier?

I have the matrix for P·n as (ħ/2) multiplied by [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

So the eigenvalues of this matrix are (ħ/2)(±1), because the matrix is (ħ/2)[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. The trace is zero, and the determinant is -(ħ/2)^2 (n_z² +n_x²) = -(ħ/2)^2 (1 - n_x²) since n_x² +n_z² =1. Wait, no, n_x² + n_z² =1, so determinant is (ħ/2)^2 * (n_z * (-n_z) ) - (n_x)^2 = (ħ/2)^2 ( -n_z² -n_x² ). Which is (ħ/2)^2 (-1) (n_z² +n_x^2 ) = - (ħ/2)^2. So the determinant is - (ħ/2)^2. Then the eigenvalues are [ trace ± sqrt(trace² -4 determinant) ] / 2. But trace is zero, so eigenvalues are ± sqrt( -4 determinant ) /2. Determinant is - (ħ/2)^2 → -4 determinant is 4 (ħ/2)^2 → sqrt(4 (ħ/2)^2 ) = 2*(ħ/2) ) = ħ. So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which matches the given eigenvalue.

So the eigenvectors are found by solving (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> =0. Which brings us back to the same equations as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should re-examine the eigenvector components. Let me take a specific case to see what the eigenvector looks like.

For example, if n is along z (theta=0), then n_x=0, n_z=1.

Then the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the eigenvector [1,0], which in our parametrization would be cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) with theta=0, giving [1,0], which is correct.

If n is along x (theta=90 degrees), then n_x=1, n_z=0.

The matrix becomes (ħ/2) [[0,1], [1, 0]], whose eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1,1]/sqrt(2), because the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and the eigenvectors would be [1,1] and [1,-1], normalized.

In our parametrization, theta=90, so theta/2=45 degrees. cos(45)=√2/2, sin(45)=√2/2. So the eigenvector becomes [√2/2, √2/2], which is [1,1]/√2, which matches. So this case works, and our parametrization is correct.

Therefore, the eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator along the arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, since $n_y = 0$. Substituting the given components of $\vec{P}$, the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle,
\]

where $|\psi\rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)\psi_1 + n_x \psi_2 = 0, \quad n_x \psi_1 - (n_z + 1)\psi_2 = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, the ratio of the components of the eigenvector is found to be:

\[
\frac{\psi_1}{\psi_2} = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1}.
\]

To express the eigenvector in terms of $\theta$, we use the parametrization $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting these into the ratio, the eigenvector components become:

\[
\psi_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad \psi_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

This matches the standard parametrization of the spin-up eigenstate along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is inconsistent with the spin-½ eigenstate parametrization for $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector components and is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
