Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s.

The question is about finding the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. We're supposed to consider the total mass of each system as the sum of the two stars.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's more massive and orbits more slowly. Oh right, because the center of mass is what they both orbit around. So the more massive one has a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity.

But how does this connect to the mass function or Kepler's laws? Oh, Kepler's third law probably comes into play here. The period of the orbit is related to the masses and the size of the orbit.

Wait, the period given here is the eclipse period, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system. So the period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

I think the formula involving Kepler's third law for binary systems is (a1 + a2)^3 / P^2 = (G(M1 + M2)) / (4π²), where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit, and M1, M2 are their masses.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are given by K1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * (something?), but maybe it's better to think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, another approach: the mass ratio q = M2 / M1. Then, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are inversely proportional to the mass. So K1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * (2π G / P )^(1/3) * (a1 sin i), but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) )

But wait, maybe a simpler way is to use the relation between the velocities and the masses. Since the two stars orbit the same center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, V1 / V2 = M2 / M1.

In system_1, the RVs are 10 and 5 km/s. So V1 =10, V2=5. That ratio is 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M2 = 2*M1. So the mass ratio q = 2. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2M1 = 3M1. So M1 is 1/3 of the total mass.

Wait, but wait, no. Because V1 is the velocity of star 1, which would be (M2/(M1+M2)) * (something). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the velocities. Since the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities, so M1/M2 = V2/V1.

For system_1: V1=10, V2=5. So M1/M2 =5/10 = 1/2. So M1 = (1/2) M2. So the mass ratio is 0.5.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way. So let's think: the more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's moving less for the same gravitational pull. So if Star A is more massive than Star B, then V_A < V_B.

So in system_1, Star A has a velocity of 10, Star B 5. So Star A is less massive than Star B? Wait, no, because higher velocity implies lower mass. Oh wait, wait, no: if Star A is less massive, it's moving faster because it's lighter, so it's pulled more by the more massive Star B. So higher velocity means smaller mass.

So in system_1, Star A has V=10, Star B V=5. So Star A is less massive than Star B. So M_A / M_B = V_B / V_A = 5/10 = 1/2. So M_A = (1/2) M_B. So the mass of the system is M_A + M_B = (1/2 M_B) + M_B = 3/2 M_B. So M_B is (2/3) of the total mass.

Hmm, but how does this help us compare the masses of the two systems?

Wait, the problem is to find the mass of system_1 compared to system_2. So I need to compute (M1 + M1') / (M2 + M2'), where M1 and M1' are the masses of the two stars in system_1, and M2 and M2' in system_2.

But we don't know the individual masses, only their velocity ratios and the periods. So perhaps we can find the mass ratio based on the RV amplitudes and the periods.

Let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2 pi G) / P )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

But since the inclination i isn't given, perhaps we can assume that the same inclination applies to both systems, and we can compare them.

Wait, but the problem states that the period is the time between two primary eclipses. For eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So we can proceed under that assumption.

So, simplifying, K = (2 pi G / P )^(1/3) * (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Let me consider each system.

For system_1: K1a =10, K1b=5. The sum M1a + M1b is the total mass of system_1, M1_total.

Similarly, system_2: K2a=15, K2b=10. Sum is M2_total.

Wait, but which K corresponds to which mass? Let's say in system_1, K1a is the velocity of star 1, K1b of star 2.

So from system_1:

K1a = (2 pi G / P1 )^(1/3) * (M1b) / ( (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) )

Similarly, K1b = (2 pi G / P1 )^(1/3) * (M1a) / ( (M1a + M1b)^(2/3) )

Dividing these two equations, K1a/K1b = M1b/M1a

Which gives M1b = M1a * (K1a/K1b) = M1a * (10/5 )= 2 * M1a.

So M1a : M1b = 1 : 2.

Thus, M1_total = M1a + M1b = M1a + 2 M1a = 3 M1a.

Similarly, for system_2:

K2a=15, K2b=10.

So K2a/K2b = M2b / M2a → M2b = M2a * (15/10 )= 1.5 M2a.

So M2a : M2b = 1 :1.5 → M2_total = M2a + M2b = M2a + 1.5 M2a = 2.5 M2a.

Now, let's write the expressions for the RV amplitudes for each system.

For system_1:

K1a = (2 pi G / P1 )^(1/3) * M1b / (M1_total )^(2/3 )

We know M1b = 2 M1a, and M1_total =3 M1a.

So K1a = (2 pi G / P1 )^(1/3) * (2 M1a) / ( (3 M1a )^(2/3) )

Similarly, for system_2:

K2a = (2 pi G / P2 )^(1/3) * M2b / (M2_total )^(2/3 )

M2b = 1.5 M2a, M2_total =2.5 M2a.

So K2a = (2 pi G / P2 )^(1/3) * (1.5 M2a) / ( (2.5 M2a )^(2/3) )

But wait, system_1 has K1a=10, and system_2 has K2a=15.

Wait, but let's make this more manageable. Let me define variables.

Let’s denote for system_1:

K1a = (2 pi G )^(1/3) [ M1b ] / [ P1^(1/3) (M1_total )^(2/3) ]

Similarly, for system_2:

K2a = (2 pi G )^(1/3) [ M2b ] / [ P2^(1/3) (M2_total )^(2/3) ]

Let me write the ratio K1a / K2a.

K1a / K2a = [ M1b / ( P1^(1/3) (M1_total )^(2/3) ) ] / [ M2b / ( P2^(1/3) (M2_total )^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ M1b * P2^(1/3) * (M2_total )^(2/3) ) ] / [ M2b * P1^(1/3) * (M1_total )^(2/3) ) ]

But we have expressions for M1b, M1_total, M2b, M2_total in terms of M1a and M2a.

For system_1:

M1b = 2 M1a

M1_total =3 M1a

For system_2:

M2b=1.5 M2a

M2_total=2.5 M2a

Substituting these into the ratio:

K1a/K2a = [ (2 M1a) * (P2^(1/3)) * ( (2.5 M2a) )^(2/3) ) ] / [ (1.5 M2a) * (P1^(1/3)) * (3 M1a )^(2/3) ) ]

Let me compute each part.

First, M1a and M2a are variables we don’t know, but in the ratio, they might cancel out.

Let me rearrange:

= [2 M1a ] / [1.5 M2a ] * [ (P2/P1 )^(1/3) ] * [ (2.5 M2a ) / (3 M1a ) ) ]^(2/3 )

Simplify each term:

Term1: [2 M1a ] / [1.5 M2a] = (4/3) (M1a / M2a )

Term2: [P2/P1 ]^(1/3) → system_1 has P1=2 years, system_2 P2=1 year. So P2/P1 = 1/2. So (1/2)^(1/3) = 2^(-1/3) ≈ 0.7937.

Term3: [ (2.5 M2a ) / (3 M1a ) ) ]^(2/3 )

= [ (2.5/3) * (M2a / M1a) ) ]^(2/3 )

= (5/6)^(2/3) * (M2a / M1a )^(2/3 )

Putting it all together:

K1a/K2a = (4/3) (M1a/M2a) ) * (2^(-1/3)) * (5/6 )^(2/3) * (M2a/M1a )^(2/3 )

Notice that (M1a/M2a) * (M2a/M1a )^(2/3) = [ (M1a/M2a ) ]^(1 - 2/3 ) = [M1a/M2a ]^(1/3 )

So,

K1a/K2a = (4/3) * (5/6 )^(2/3) * 2^(-1/3) * [ (M1a/M2a ) ]^(1/3 )

But K1a=10, K2a=15. So K1a/K2a = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So,

2/3 = (4/3) * (5/6 )^(2/3) * 2^(-1/3) * [ (M1a/M2a ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the constants first.

Compute (4/3) : approximately 1.333.

Compute (5/6 )^(2/3). 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. 0.8333^(2/3) is e^( (2/3) ln(0.8333) )

ln(0.8333) ≈ -0.1823. So (2/3)*(-0.1823) ≈ -0.1215. e^(-0.1215) ≈ 0.885.

Compute 2^(-1/3) = 1/(2^(1/3)) ≈ 1/1.26 ≈ 0.7937.

So,

(4/3) * 0.885 * 0.7937 ≈ 1.333 * 0.885 ≈ 1.185 → 1.185 * 0.7937 ≈ 0.938.

So,

2/3 = 0.938 * [ (M1a/M2a ) ]^(1/3 )

So, [ (M1a/M2a ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/3) / 0.938 ≈ (0.6667) / 0.938 ≈ 0.710.

So,

(M1a/M2a ) ≈ (0.710 )^3 ≈ 0.3579.

So, M1a ≈ 0.3579 M2a.

But earlier, we had M1_total =3 M1a.

And system_2's total mass is 2.5 M2a.

So,

M1_total =3 * 0.3579 M2a ≈ 1.0737 M2a.

So, system_1's total mass is about 1.0737 times system_2's total mass.

Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, M1_total / M2_total ≈ 1.0737 → approximately 1.07, which is about 1.1 times.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1.2, which is close. But let me check my calculations for errors.

Wait, let's recalculate the constants more accurately.

Compute (5/6 )^(2/3):

5/6 = 0.833333...

ln(0.83333) ≈ -0.1823215568.

Multiply by 2/3: -0.1823215568 * 2/3 ≈ -0.1215477.

e^-0.1215477 ≈ 0.885.

2^(-1/3) = 1/(2^(1/3)) ≈ 1/1.259921 ≈ 0.7937005.

So,

(4/3) * 0.885 = (1.333333) * 0.885 ≈ 1.184166.

1.184166 * 0.7937 ≈ 1.184166 *0.7937 ≈ Let's calculate:

1.184166 *0.7937. 1 *0.7937 is 0.7937. 0.184166 *0.7937 ≈ approx 0.1463. So total ≈ 0.9399.

So,

(4/3) * (5/6 )^(2/3) * 2^(-1/3) ≈ 0.94.

So,

0.94 * [(M1a/M2a)^(1/3)] = 2/3 → 0.94 * x = 0.6667 → x = 0.6667 / 0.94 ≈ 0.709.

So x^3 ≈ 0.709^3 → Let's compute 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.71^3= 0.357, 0.709^3 ≈ let's compute:

0.709 * 0.709 = 0.502681. Then *0.709 again: 0.502681 *0.709 ≈ 0.356.

So M1a/M2a ≈ 0.356.

So M1_total =3 *0.356 M2a → 1.068 M2a.

Wait, but M2_total is 2.5 M2a. So M1_total =1.068 M2a, M2_total=2.5 M2a.

Wait, no, M2a is a variable here. Wait, no, wait, M2a is part of system_2's parameters. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I messed up a bit. Let me think about the variables.

We have:

In system_1, M1_total =3 M1a.

In system_2, M2_total=2.5 M2a.

And from the ratio, M1a=0.3579 M2a.

So,

M1_total =3 *0.3579 M2a ≈ 1.0737 M2a.

So,

M1_total / M2_total = (1.0737 M2a ) / (2.5 M2a ) ) = 1.0737 / 2.5 ≈ 0.4295.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply system_1 is less massive than system_2, but option D is ~0.7, which would suggest system_1 is 0.7 times as massive as system_2, i.e., less massive.

But wait, that would make system_1 less massive than system_2, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Hmm, so if M1_total is 0.4295 times M2_total, then system_1 is less massive. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B ~0.6, D ~0.7.

Wait, but this would suggest the correct answer is approximately 0.4, option A.

But I thought earlier that M1_total was about 1.07 times M2_total, but that's not the case. Because M2_total is 2.5 M2a, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express everything in terms of M2a.

Wait, M1_total = 3 * M1a = 3 *0.3579 M2a → approximately 1.0737 M2a.

M2_total =2.5 M2a.

So, the mass ratio (M1_total)/(M2_total) =1.0737 M2a / 2.5 M2a = 1.0737 /2.5 ≈0.4295.

So, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.43, which is option A.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So if system_1's mass is 0.43 times system_2's, it's actually less massive. So the factor would be 0.43, which is option A.

But let's think, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me retrace.

We started with K1a =10, K2a=15.

Wait another approach: the total mass of the system is equal to (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 pi G), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P)/(2 pi G), but that's only for one component.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the fact that the mass ratio q = M2/M1, and then find the relationship between the velocities and the periods.

Let me think about the formula for the mass function.

The mass function for each star is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2 pi G) * sin^3 i.

But as I said earlier, for eclipsing binaries, sin i is close to 1, so we can ignore it.

So f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2 pi G).

But the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But because we're dealing with two systems, perhaps we can set up a ratio.

Let me define for system_1:

f1 = (K1a^3 P1 )/(2 pi G ) = (M1b^3 ) / ( (M1a + M1b )^2 )

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (K2a^3 P2 )/(2 pi G ) = (M2b^3 ) / ( (M2a + M2b )^2 )

But let's compute f1 and f2 and then compare.

But we don't know the absolute masses, so perhaps taking the ratio f1 / f2 will eliminate some variables.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the mass function for each system and then find the mass ratio.

Wait, but let's compute the mass function for each system.

For system_1:

f1 = (10^3 * 2 ) / (2 pi G ) = (1000 * 2 )/(2 pi G ) = 2000/(2 pi G ) ≈ 1000/(pi G )

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (15^3 * 1 )/(2 pi G ) = (3375 * 1 )/(2 pi G ) = 3375/(2 pi G )

Then, f1 / f2 = [1000/(pi G ) ] / [3375/(2 pi G ) ] = (1000 * 2 ) / 3375 ≈ 2000/3375 ≈ 0.59259.

So f1/f2 ≈0.5926.

But f(M) is (M2^3 )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Wait, for system_1, M1a is the mass whose velocity is 10, M1b is 5. So M1a is less massive than M1b. So M1a = (5/10 ) * M1b = 0.5 M1b.

Wait, but the mass function is f(M1a ) = (M1b^3 ) / ( (M1a + M1b )^2 )

Substituting M1a =0.5 M1b,

f(M1a ) = ( M1b^3 ) / ( (0.5 M1b + M1b )^2 ) = (M1b^3 )/( (1.5 M1b )^2 ) = M1b^3 / (2.25 M1b^2 ) ) = M1b / 2.25.

Similarly, f(M1a ) = M1b / 2.25.

But f1 = (K1a^3 P1 )/(2 pi G ) = M1b / 2.25.

Similarly, for system_2:

M2a is the mass with K=15, M2b with K=10.

So M2a = (10/15 ) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

So M2a = (2/3) M2b.

So f(M2a ) = (M2b^3 ) / ( (M2a + M2b )^2 ) = ( M2b^3 ) / ( ( (2/3 M2b ) + M2b )^2 ) = M2b^3 / ( (5/3 M2b )^2 ) = M2b^3 / (25/9 M2b^2 ) ) = (9/25) M2b.

So, f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(2 pi G ) = 3375/(2 pi G ) = f(M2a ) = (9/25) M2b.

Now, the ratio f1/f2 = [ (M1b/2.25 ) ] / [ (9/25) M2b ) ]

= [ M1b /2.25 ] * [25/(9 M2b) ]

= (25 M1b )/(2.25 *9 M2b )

= (25 M1b )/(20.25 M2b )

= (25/20.25 ) * ( M1b / M2b )

25/20.25 is approximately 1.2345.

So,

f1/f2 ≈ 1.2345 * (M1b / M2b ) = 0.5926.

So,

M1b / M2b = 0.5926 / 1.2345 ≈ 0.4797.

So, M1b ≈0.48 M2b.

But from earlier, in system_1, M1a =0.5 M1b.

So M1a =0.5 * 0.48 M2b =0.24 M2b.

Now, the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b =0.24 M2b +0.48 M2b =0.72 M2b.

Wait, system_2's total mass is M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b ) + M2b = (5/3 ) M2b ≈1.6667 M2b.

So, M1_total =0.72 M2b.

So the ratio M1_total / M2_total = 0.72 M2b / (1.6667 M2b ) = 0.72 / 1.6667 ≈0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4.

Wait, but another way to compute this is to find M1_total / M2_total.

We have M1_total =0.72 M2b, and M2_total =1.6667 M2b.

So,

M1_total / M2_total = 0.72 / 1.6667 ≈0.432.

So the answer is approximately 0.4, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity (RV) amplitudes, orbital periods, and stellar masses. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Radial Velocity Ratios and Mass Ratios**:  
   In a binary system, the radial velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a mass ratio of \( M_1^{\text{a}} : M_1^{\text{b}} = 1 : 2 \). For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a mass ratio of \( M_2^{\text{a}} : M_2^{\text{b}} = 1 : 1.5 \).

2. **Total Mass of Each System**:  
   The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars.  
   - For system_1: \( M_1^{\text{total}} = M_1^{\text{a}} + M_1^{\text{b}} = M_1^{\text{a}} + 2M_1^{\text{a}} = 3M_1^{\text{a}} \).  
   - For system_2: \( M_2^{\text{total}} = M_2^{\text{a}} + M_2^{\text{b}} = M_2^{\text{a}} + 1.5M_2^{\text{a}} = 2.5M_2^{\text{a}} \).

3. **Relating the Masses Using RV Amplitudes and Periods**:  
   The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the mass ratio and orbital period \( P \) by the formula:  
   \[
   K = \frac{(2\pi G)^{1/3} M_{\text{companion}}}{P^{1/3} (M_{\text{total}})^{2/3}}
   \]
   Taking the ratio of \( K_1^{\text{a}} / K_2^{\text{a}} \), we can eliminate constants and derive the relationship between \( M_1^{\text{a}} \) and \( M_2^{\text{a}} \). After substituting the given RV amplitudes (\( K_1^{\text{a}} = 10 \), \( K_2^{\text{a}} = 15 \)) and orbital periods (\( P_1 = 2 \), \( P_2 = 1 \)), the calculations yield \( M_1^{\text{a}} / M_2^{\text{a}} \approx 0.357 \).

4. **Mass Ratio of the Systems**:  
   Using the total masses:  
   \[
   \frac{M_1^{\text{total}}}{M_2^{\text{total}}} = \frac{3M_1^{\text{a}}}{2.5M_2^{\text{a}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( M_1^{\text{a}} / M_2^{\text{a}} \approx 0.357 \):  
   \[
   \frac{M_1^{\text{total}}}{M_2^{\text{total}}} = \frac{3(0.357)}{2.5} \approx 0.432
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   System_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.

Answer: A
