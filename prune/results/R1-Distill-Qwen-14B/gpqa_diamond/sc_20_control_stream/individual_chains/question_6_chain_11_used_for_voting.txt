Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's read it again. The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials that depend on r and θ, it's often helpful to switch to polar coordinates. The particle has a mass m, and the potential seems to have terms involving r squared and cos squared theta. So, perhaps this is a case of a two-dimensional central potential with some angular dependence?

Wait, no, central potentials depend only on r, right? But here, the potential depends on cos²θ, which means it has angular dependence. So it's not a central potential. Hmm, that complicates things because we can't use the straightforward radial and angular parts as in the hydrogen atom problem.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the energy spectrum. Maybe the potential can be rewritten in a way that separates variables or resembles a known system. Let me think. Let's look at the potential again: (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, perhaps I can factor out kr². So, V(r,θ) = kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ]. Alternatively, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Wait, that might help. Let me think about the form of that. Because 3 cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in:

3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ.

So substituting back into V(r,θ):

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [ 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Wait, 1 + 3/2 is 5/2, so:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² * (5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, maybe that's not the most helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor out the kr² as a common term.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of effective potential or effective potentials in certain coordinate systems. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be expressed as a sum of a radial term and an angular term, but it's multiplied together. Wait, no, because V is a product of r² and a function of theta. So it's not separable in that sense. So, perhaps we can't separate the variables as in the standard method for solving the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use a coordinate transformation. Because of the cos2θ term, maybe it's better to switch to coordinates involving θ and another angle, or perhaps use Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps this potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think about that. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x² / r². So substituting that into V(r,θ):

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting! Because x is one of the Cartesian coordinates. So the potential becomes V = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x². Hmm, so in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². But wait, r² is x² + y², so substituting that in:

V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2) + (3/2) ] k x² + (1/2)k y².

Simplify that: (2)k x² + (1/2)k y².

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's a quadratic potential in x and y with different coefficients. That looks like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies in different directions.

In a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the potential is usually V = (1/2)mω_x² x² + (1/2)mω_y² y². The energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y +1)ℏ ω_ average or something like that, but with each direction contributing its own quantum numbers.

But wait, in this case, the potential is V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So, perhaps I can write this in terms of standard harmonic oscillator potentials by considering the frequencies.

Wait, the potential for a harmonic oscillator in x is (1/2) m ω_x² x², so comparing to 2k x², I can write (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k. So ω_x = sqrt( (4k)/m ). Similarly, for the y-direction, (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2) k, so ω_y = sqrt( k/m ).

Then the energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ( (ω_x + ω_y)/2 )? Wait, no. Wait, the energy for each direction is (n_x + 1/2)ℏ ω_x and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y. So the total energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Wait, substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(4k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

But sqrt(4k/m) is 2 sqrt(k/m), so E becomes:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify the terms inside:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that would be the correct option.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I correctly identify the potential in terms of x and y?

Yes, because when I expanded V(r,θ) into Cartesian coordinates, I correctly substituted cosθ as x/r, so cos²θ is x²/r². Then V becomes (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 k x²). Expanding that, I correctly broke down into terms of x² and y², leading to 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, but wait the 2k comes from 1/2 kr² is (k/2)(x² + y²), and 3/2 k x² is added. So the x² term becomes (k/2 + 3k/2) x² = (2k) x². The y² term is (k/2) y². So yes, that's correct.

So the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x and ω_y as I calculated. So the energy levels are E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y +1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Which leads to E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), as I found earlier. So that's option C.

The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To analyze this, we switch to Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \). Substituting \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Expanding \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. The potential can be expressed as:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2x^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2y^2,
\]

where the frequencies are determined by comparing terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2 = 2k \implies \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \implies \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The energy spectrum for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y,
\]

where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are the quantum numbers in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions, respectively. Substituting \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) and \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), we get:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches option **C**. Therefore, the energy spectrum is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To analyze this, we switch to Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \). Substituting \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Expanding \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential in Cartesian coordinates is:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. The potential can be expressed as:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2x^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2y^2,
\]

where the frequencies are determined by comparing terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2 = 2k \implies \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}m\omega_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \implies \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The energy spectrum for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y,

where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are the quantum numbers in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions, respectively. Substituting \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) and \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), we get:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches option **C**. Therefore, the energy spectrum is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]
