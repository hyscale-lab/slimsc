Alright, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let me try to think through this.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a trigonal planar structure with a horizontal mirror plane. C3h is one of the point groups, right? So, it's like having a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis. Wait, or is it the other way around? I think the h in C3h stands for horizontal, meaning the mirror plane is horizontal relative to the rotation axis. So the molecule would look the same after a 120-degree rotation and would be symmetric across that horizontal plane.

Okay, now I need to look at each of the given molecules and determine their symmetry.

The options are:
A) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) Triisopropyl borate
D) Quinuclidine

I'll go through each one by one.

Starting with C) Triisopropyl borate. I think this molecule has three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. So, the structure is like B with three identical substituents. Isopropyl groups are symmetric on their own, but when attached to the central atom, does that give it C3 symmetry? Wait, I think triisopropyl borane (or borate) is a trigonal planar molecule because each isopropyl is in a plane around B. So the molecule would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm trying to visualize. If it's trigonal planar, yes, there are multiple mirror planes. Oh wait, no. Wait, in a trigonal planar structure, there are three mirror planes each bisecting a pair of substituents. But wait, in the case of triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl is symmetric, so the molecule should have a C3h symmetry. Because after a 120-degree rotation, it looks the same, and there's a horizontal mirror plane (maybe along the B atom's plane). So option C could be a candidate.

But let me not jump to conclusions. Let's check the others.

Option D) Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, if I remember correctly. It has a bridge structure, sort of like a cube with a bridge. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. I think it has a C3 symmetry. Wait, does it have a three-fold axis? Quinuclidine has a central bridge, and each of the three bridges is equivalent. So maybe it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think quinuclidine has an S4 symmetry, but perhaps that's another point group. Wait, maybe it's C2 or something else. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with some other molecule. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The point group C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across that mirror plane.

Looking at option B, Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The structure has three benzene rings fused with furan rings. Wait, the benzo part means a benzene ring attached. The numbering suggests that the molecule is a fused ring system. I'm trying to imagine it. If it's a structure where three rings are attached in a symmetrical fashion, maybe similar to corannulene or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic system with three benzene rings connected in a way that the symmetry is C3h. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a structure similar to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which would have C3 symmetry. But wait, the presence of furan rings might complicate that. Maybe the molecule has three-fold rotational symmetry but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Option A is similar but with triphenylene groups. Triphenylene is a larger aromatic system. The name suggests that three phenyl groups are attached at certain positions. So, maybe this molecule has a higher degree of symmetry. The triphenylene part could have a three-fold symmetry. Wait, triphenylene itself is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a way that's symmetric. So perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central structure, allowing for C3h symmetry.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each molecule's symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): The boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl group is identical, so the molecule has a trigonal planar geometry. That would imply a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. The mirror planes would include the planes that bisect the angles between each pair of substituents. So if the molecule has C3 symmetry and also a mirror plane, then it could be C3h. Wait, but what's the exact point group for this structure?

Wait, a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents (like BF3) would have D3h symmetry. Oh, wait, no. Wait, BF3 has a trigonal planar geometry, which is D3h symmetry. Because it has a three-fold rotation axis, three mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So if triisopropyl borate is similar, maybe it's D3h. So then, if the question is about C3h, which is a lower symmetry than D3h, that might not fit. Hmm, but wait, maybe the substituents in triisopropyl borate don't allow for the same symmetry as BF3. Because in BF3, the structure is flat, but the isopropyl groups are more bulky. Wait, but the molecule is still trigonal planar, so it should have D3h symmetry. So, that would be higher than C3h symmetry. So perhaps option C doesn't have C3h symmetry but higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but in the case of triisopropyl borate, the molecule is symmetric across the plane that includes the boron and bisects the substituents. So that's a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the point group C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other mirror planes. D3h has more mirror planes. So if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then its symmetry is higher than C3h. So maybe none of the options would have C3h, but the question says one does. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about triisopropyl borate.

Let's look at the other options again.

Option D: Quinuclidine. The structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a bridge structure. It's a tricyclic molecule. Quinuclidine is a bridgehead amine. The molecule has three bridges, each of two carbons. So, does it have a three-fold rotation axis? If you look down the central bridge, maybe. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the molecule is symmetric with a C3 axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, I've heard that quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making its point group C3h. Wait, that seems possible. Because the molecule is symmetric in such a way that rotating 120 degrees would map the structure onto itself, and there's a mirror plane that bisects the structure.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the structure again. Quinuclidine has three bridgeheads, each with two CH2 groups. The molecule is symmetrical around the three-fold axis. If you rotate it 120 degrees, each bridge would move to the next position. And if there's a horizontal mirror plane, that would pass through the center and reflect the structure appropriately.

Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has a higher symmetry, like D3h, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The point group C3h implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other mirror planes or symmetry elements beyond that. So which of these molecules fits that?

Triphenyleno... (option A): Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings fused in a way that forms a truxene-like structure. When attached to a central trifuran system, would that create a C3h symmetry? If the three substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe. For example, if each phenyl is in a position that a 120-degree rotation would cycle them, and there's a mirror plane, perhaps.

But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Similarly, option B's structure perhaps doesn't have the necessary symmetry.

Wait, another thought: triphenylene itself is a C3 symmetric molecule. So if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around it, maybe the entire molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the molecule in option A might be a more extended structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, thinking about the molecules:

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. If it's D3h, then it's not C3h. So it's out.

Option D: Quinuclidine. If it's C3h, then D would be the answer.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some of the point groups. Let me recall: for C3h, it's a molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. It doesn't have any other symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes. In contrast, D3h has multiple mirror planes and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, which of the given molecules has exactly a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, without any other elements?

Triisopropyl borate would have D3h since it's trigonal planar with three identical substituents, which would include multiple mirror planes.

Quinuclidine: Let me think about its structure. It has three bridges. If you look along the three-fold axis, each bridge should look the same. So a 120-degree rotation would map the molecule onto itself. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, I'm trying to visualize. If the molecule is arranged such that the three bridges are symmetrically placed, then perhaps the mirror plane would pass through the center and one of the bridges, reflecting the others. Wait, but if the mirror plane is horizontal, that would mean it's perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, in quinuclidine, if you slice it with a plane that is perpendicular to the main axis (the bridge), would the structure be symmetric? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is along the three-fold axis, which would be vertical, not horizontal. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has a C3v symmetry. Wait, C3v has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes. That would mean that it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, which is what C3h requires. So perhaps quinuclidine's symmetry is C3v, not C3h. Then, maybe option D is not the answer.

Let me think again about the third option, option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If the central part is a trifuran (three furan rings), and the substituents are triphenylene groups, which are symmetric. So, the molecule might have a three-fold axis where each substituent is equivalent. If the molecule also has a horizontal mirror plane, then C3h would apply.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that a rotation of 120 degrees cycles them, and a mirror plane exists perpendicular to the rotation axis, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact structure of each option. Let me try to think of another approach.

The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. From what I remember, quinuclidine has a C3h symmetry. Wait, no, I think quinuclidine's point group is actually Td (tetrahedral), but that's for the structure. Wait, no. Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic compound. Wait, perhaps it has a C3 axis. Let me look up (mentally) some point groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another way: think about whether the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: Yes, but it also has other mirror planes, so D3h, not C3h.

Benzo[...]trifuran (option B): Maybe it's a six-membered ring with substituents. Not sure if it has the required symmetry.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A): Perhaps it's symmetric with three phenyl groups attached in a trigonal fashion.

Wait, let me think about each molecule's possible symmetry:

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure: three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Definitely trigonal planar. So, has a C3 axis. It also has a horizontal mirror plane through the boron. So, that would imply C3h symmetry. Wait, but earlier I thought it was D3h. Hmm.

Wait, wait, D3h has a horizontal mirror plane, a vertical C3 axis, and other mirror planes (like three vertical ones). So, if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis, but no other mirror planes, then it would be C3h. But in reality, triisopropyl borate does have other mirror planes. For example, each isopropyl group is symmetric, so the molecule should have mirror planes that bisect each pair of substituents. So that would give three vertical mirror planes, making it D3h.

So, option C would have D3h symmetry, not C3h.

Which brings me back to option D, quinuclidine.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the furan-based molecules has the correct symmetry.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. The structure has three benzene rings attached to the trifuran. The benzo substitution suggests that three benzene rings are attached to the furan system. If the positions are symmetric, such that a 120-degree rotation would cycle the benzene rings, and a horizontal mirror plane exists, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Similarly, option A has triphenylene groups, which are symmetric.

Wait, triphenylene is a flat, fully conjugated molecule with three benzene rings. So, if it's attached to a central structure symmetrically, that could give the molecule a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option A has a higher symmetry than C3h.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but let me make an educated guess. From what I remember, quinuclidine has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it has a mirror plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, making it C3v. So, it wouldn't have a horizontal mirror plane, which is needed for C3h.

So, considering the options again, perhaps option A is the correct answer. If the triphenylene groups are arranged symmetrically around the trifuran core, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, it would fit C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, option B's structure: benzo groups attached in a way that might not be symmetric enough. For example, if the benzene rings are attached in a non-symmetrical fashion, the molecule might not have the required symmetry.

Wait, another angle. The question asks which has C3h symmetry. Which of the options is known to have that?

I think triphenyleno-based structures can have C3h symmetry. For example, if the triphenylene groups are arranged in a trigonal fashion around the central trifuran, which would create a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, putting all this together, option A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone might have C3h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σ), but no additional symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three triphenylene groups attached symmetrically. The triphenylene groups are aromatic and symmetric, and their arrangement around the central trifuran suggests a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule likely has a horizontal mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to the three-fold axis. This matches the symmetry requirements of **C₃h**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule has a trifuran core with three benzo (benzene) rings attached. While the molecule may have some symmetry, the arrangement of the benzo rings is less symmetric compared to the triphenylene groups in Option A. It is unlikely to have a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane, making it inconsistent with **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
This molecule has a boron atom at the center with three identical isopropyl groups attached, forming a trigonal planar geometry. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and multiple mirror planes, it also has additional vertical mirror planes, which elevate its symmetry to **D₃h**. Therefore, it does not fit the **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, which align it with **C₃v** symmetry rather than **C₃h**. Thus, it does not match the required symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Option A, **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**, is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements, as it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane without additional symmetry elements.

**Answer: A**

Alternatively, perhaps it has a mirror plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, making it C3v. So, it wouldn't have a horizontal mirror plane, which is needed for C3h.

So, considering the options again, perhaps option A is the correct answer. If the triphenylene groups are arranged symmetrically around the trifuran core, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, it would fit C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, option B's structure: benzo groups attached in a way that might not be symmetric enough. For example, if the benzene rings are attached in a non-symmetrical fashion, the molecule might not have the required symmetry.

Wait, another angle. The question asks which has C3h symmetry. Which of the options is known to have that?

I think triphenyleno-based structures can have C3h symmetry. For example, if the triphenylene groups are arranged in a trigonal fashion around the central trifuran, which would create a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, putting all this together, option A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone might have C3h symmetry.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σ), but no additional symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three triphenylene groups attached symmetrically. The triphenylene groups are aromatic and symmetric, and their arrangement around the central trifuran suggests a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule likely has a horizontal mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to the three-fold axis. This matches the symmetry requirements of **C₃h**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule has a trifuran core with three benzo (benzene) rings attached. While the molecule may have some symmetry, the arrangement of the benzo rings is less symmetric compared to the triphenylene groups in Option A. It is unlikely to have a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane, making it inconsistent with **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
This molecule has a boron atom at the center with three identical isopropyl groups attached, forming a trigonal planar geometry. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and multiple mirror planes, it also has additional vertical mirror planes, which elevate its symmetry to **D₃h**. Therefore, it does not fit the **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, which align it with **C₃v** symmetry rather than **C₃h**. Thus, it does not match the required symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Option A, **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**, is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements, as it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane without additional symmetry elements.
