Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, let me think. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and σ · n would be the dot product, so each component multiplied by the corresponding n component and summed.

Wait, eigenvalues of Pauli matrices... I remember that each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is a combination of the Pauli matrices. So when you have something like σ · n, which is a vector in some direction, the eigenvalues would depend on that direction.

But wait, no, wait. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1 for each individual matrix, but when you have a linear combination like that, the eigenvalues would be the magnitude of the vector. Oh wait, no, wait. Because σ · n is a matrix where each component is multiplied by n_i, so it's a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvalues would be the eigenvalues of that specific matrix.

Wait, another approach. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their expectation values are real, and their eigenvalues are real. So the Hamiltonian here is H = ε (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). Since each σ_i is Hermitian, H is Hermitian as well, so its eigenvalues are real.

But what are the eigenvalues? I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. But when you have a combination like σ · n, the eigenvalues would be the magnitude of the vector n multiplied by ε? Wait, no, because n is a unit vector. So the scalar product is just the sum of each σ_i times n_i.

Wait, let me think about the trace and determinant. The trace of σ · n would be the sum of the diagonal elements. Looking at each σ matrix, σ_x and σ_y have trace zero, and σ_z has trace zero as well. Wait, no. Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0. Similarly, σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], trace 0. σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], trace 0. So if H is a linear combination of these, then the trace of H is zero as well.

The determinant: for Pauli matrices, each σ_i has determinant -1. Wait, σ_x's determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Same for σ_y and σ_z.

So if H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), then H is a 2x2 matrix. The trace of H is zero because each term in the sum has trace zero, so the sum's trace is zero. The determinant of H would be [ε]^2 times the determinant of (n_x σ_x + ...) matrix.

Wait, but what's the determinant of a matrix like a σ · n? Let's think about σ · n as a matrix, which is a linear combination. The determinant of σ · n is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since each σ_i has determinant -1, but when you have a linear combination, the determinant isn't simply the product. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix M satisfy det(M - λ I) = 0. For a 2x2 matrix, the characteristic equation is λ² - Tr(M) λ + det(M) = 0. Since Tr(H) is zero, the equation becomes λ² + det(H) = 0. So the eigenvalues are ± sqrt(-det(H)).

Wait, but H = ε (σ · n) = ε S, where S is σ · n. So the determinant of H is [ε]^2 determinant(S).

What's the determinant of S = σ · n? Let's compute S. S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out:

S = n_x [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + n_y [ [0,-i], [i,0] ] + n_z [ [1,0], [0,-1] ]

So the matrix S would be:

[ n_z, n_x - i n_y ]
[ n_x + i n_y, -n_z ]

The determinant of this matrix is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y). Let's compute that.

(n_z)(-n_z) = -n_z².

(n_x -i n_y)(n_x +i n_y) = (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2 + (i^2)(-n_y^2) → because (a-b)(a+b)=a² -b². Wait, wait, (n_x -i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = n_x² + (i n_x)(-i n_y) + ... Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it: (a)(a) where a is (n_x - i n_y) and the other term is (n_x + i n_y). So (n_x -i n_y)(n_x +i n_y) = n_x² + (i n_x)(i n_y) + (-i n_y)(n_x) + (-i n_y)(i n_y).

Wait, no. Let me use the formula (a-b)(a+b) = a² - b². Here, a is n_x, b is i n_y. So (n_x)^2 - (i n_y)^2. (i n_y)^2 is (i²)(n_y²) = (-1)(n_y²) = -n_y². So the product is n_x² - (-n_y²) = n_x² + n_y².

So determinant of S is -n_z² - (n_x² + n_y²) = - (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²).

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So determinant(S) is -(1) = -1.

So det(H) = (ε)^2 * (-1) = - ε².

But since H is 2x2, the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 + det(H) =0 → λ^2 = - det(H) → λ^2 = ε² → λ = ± ε.

Wait, no, wait. Because H = ε S. So H's determinant is [ε]^2 * det(S) = ε^2 (-1) → det(H) = -ε².

Then the characteristic equation is λ² - Tr(H) λ + det(H) = 0. But Tr(H)=0, so equation is λ² + (-ε²) = 0 → λ² = ε² → λ = ±ε.

So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. Looking at the options:

Option B says +ε and -ε. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thought: I thought each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε. So yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1 because the Pauli matrices' eigenvalues are ±1, and since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1. So the maximum eigenvalue is +1, min is -1. Then, multiplying by ε, eigenvalues are ±ε.

Yes, that seems correct.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing its structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Pauli Matrices and Their Properties**: Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\) is also Hermitian because \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector.

2. **Eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\)**: The eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), as it is a linear combination of Pauli matrices scaled by the unit vector \(\vec{n}\). The eigenvalues depend only on the magnitude of the vector, which is 1 in this case.

3. **Scaling by \(\varepsilon\)**: The Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) scales the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) by \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

### Conclusion:
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\). Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option B**.
