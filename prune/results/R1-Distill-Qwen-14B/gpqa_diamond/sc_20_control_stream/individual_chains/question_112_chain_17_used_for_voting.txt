Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, so let me think about that matrix. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because the basis is |up> and |down>, which are two states), the matrix would look like this:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Because for i ≠ j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix representation given is A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, this would be:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

Yes, that's correct. So this operator is actually proportional to the Pauli X matrix, but scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So our operator A is (hbar/2) * X.

Wait, but actually, wait. The Pauli matrices are usually defined with σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], but our operator A is (hbar/2) σx. So the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates of the operator A as well. Because if |psi> is an eigenstate of σx, then A |psi> = (hbar/2) σx |psi>, so the eigenvalues are scaled by hbar/2.

So the first part of the problem is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. That is, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, another approach is to find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in that basis, and compute the probabilities. So let me outline the steps I need to take.

First, normalize the given state |alpha> because it's only proportional to that combination. The question says it's proportional, so we need to find the normalization constant.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|c1|^2 + |c2|^2), where c1 = (1+i), c2 = (2-i).

Compute |c1|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.

|c2|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and the normalization is 1/sqrt(2 +5) =1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Okay, that's the normalized state.

Next, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is (hbar/2) σx, its eigenstates are the same as those of σx. The eigenstates of σx are the states that are superpositions of |up> and |down> with equal amplitudes.

Wait, the eigenstates of σx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σx |+x> = |+x>, and similarly for the other eigenstate.

So, the eigenstates of A would be the same, but scaled by 1/sqrt(2). Let me denote them as |+x> and |-x>, where:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So our goal is to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, because then the coefficients' magnitudes squared will give the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate.

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me denote this as:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

We can find a and b by expressing |alpha> in terms of the basis |up> and |down>, and then solving for a and b.

Alternatively, we can express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down> and set up equations.

Let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Now, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, we can express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

But to write this in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can solve for the coefficients. Let me set up the equations.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination:
|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>:

a |+x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
b |-x> = b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So adding these together:

|alpha> = [a (|up> + |down> ) + b (|up> - |down> ) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

But |alpha> is known in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So equating the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So we have two equations:

1. (a + b) = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2. (a - b) = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

We can solve for a and b by adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [3] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So a = (3 sqrt(2) )/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(2 sqrt(7/2)) ) Hmm, wait let me compute more carefully.

Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i -2 +i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

So now a and b are found.

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2 because |alpha> is expressed as a|+x> + b|-x>.

Let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = [3 sqrt(2)] / [2 sqrt(7) ) ] = 3/(sqrt(14)) because sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is 1/sqrt(7/2), but perhaps it's easier to compute the modulus squared.

|a|^2 = (3^2 * 2 ) / (4 *7) ) = (9 *2 )/(28) ) = 18/28 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, wait, let me compute this correctly.

a = (3 * sqrt(2)) / (2 * sqrt(7)) )

So |a|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) because (sqrt(2))^2=2 and (sqrt(7))^2=7.

So (9 * 2) / (4 *7 )= 18/28 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) * 2 ] / (4 *7 )

Because |(-1 + 2i)|^2 = (1 +4)=5, and then multiplied by (sqrt(2))^2=2, denominator is (2 sqrt(7))^2 =4 *7=28.

So |b|^2 = (5 * 2 )/(4*7) )= 10/28=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the expression is [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is [ |(-1 + 2i)|^2 * |sqrt(2)|^2 ] / ( |2 sqrt(7)|^2 )

|(-1 + 2i)|^2 is 1 +4=5.

|sqrt(2)|^2 is 2.

Denominator: (2 sqrt(7))^2 is 4*7=28.

So |b|^2= (5 *2)/28 =10/28=5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are |a|^2=9/14≈0.642857 and |b|^2=5/14≈0.35714.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check the initial setup again. Wait, because the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, so the probabilities would be |a|^2 and |b|^2 as I computed.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which option has probabilities around 0.64 and 0.36. The first option is A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.643, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are about 0.643 and 0.357. So the first part of the question's answers are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, but in the options, they are given as 0.64 and 0.36, which would match option A. But wait, let me check the other parts as well.

Wait, but the question also asks for the average value of the operator A. So I need to compute <A>, which is the expectation value of A in state |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) σx, <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| σx |alpha> .

But another approach is that since |+x> and |-x> are eigenstates of A with eigenvalues ±(hbar/2), then the expectation value would be (|a|^2)(hbar/2) + (|b|^2)(-hbar/2) )= ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) (hbar/2 )

Because |a|^2 is the probability of measuring +hbar/2, and |b|^2 is the probability of measuring -hbar/2.

So let me compute |a|^2 - |b|^2.

From earlier, |a|^2=9/14, |b|^2=5/14.

So 9/14 -5/14=4/14=2/7.

So <A> = (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= (2/7)(hbar/2 ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.643 (≈0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (≈0.36), and the average is hbar/7.

So option A would be the correct one.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.

Wait, let me think again about the expectation value calculation. Since |+x> has eigenvalue + (hbar/2), and |-x> has eigenvalue - (hbar/2), the expectation value is |a|^2*(hbar/2) + |b|^2*(-hbar/2) )= [ |a|^2 - |b|^2 ] * (hbar/2 )

Which is (9/14 -5/14) * hbar/2 = (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= (2 * hbar ) / (14) )= hbar/7.

Yes, that makes sense.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me check the other options quickly. Option D has average 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is much larger than what I have. Option B has average 3hbar/sqrt(7), which doesn't fit. Option C has average hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 0.377 hbar, but I have hbar/7 which is about 0.1428 hbar.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the operator A.

Wait, operator A is (hbar/2) σx. So its eigenvalues are ± (hbar/2). So the expectation value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So <A> = (|a|^2)(hbar/2) + (|b|^2)(-hbar/2) )= (|a|^2 - |b|^2)(hbar/2)

Which, as I computed, is (9/14 -5/14) * hbar/2 = (4/14)(hbar/2 )= (2/7)(hbar/2 )= hbar/7.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the answer would be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is the first option. So the correct choice is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:  
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5.
\]  
Thus, the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{2+5} = 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state becomes:  
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \hbar/2 \\ \hbar/2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]  
This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are:  
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]  
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( +\hbar/2 \) and \( -\hbar/2 \), corresponding to \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in:  
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle.
\]  
Equating coefficients, we find:  
\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]  
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:  
\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]  
Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]  
Substituting \( |a|^2 = 9/14 \) and \( |b|^2 = 5/14 \), we get:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:  
**Probabilities: \( 0.64, 0.36 \), Average value: \( \hbar/7 \).**
