Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Starting with benzene, I have to perform several reactions in the right order to get this structure. So, the target has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, which means it's a meta arrangement. Wait, no, wait. Wait, numbering: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the substituents are adjacent in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Oh, but that can't be right because if it's 1,2,3, they're all adjacent, which is a bit unusual. Wait, no, wait: 2 is ortho to 1, and 3 is meta to 1. Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Let me draw a benzene ring. Let's number the positions. Position 1 is ethoxy. Then position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in a 1,2,3 triplet. Wait, but that would place the nitro group next to the tert-butyl, which is next to the ethoxy. Hmm, but maybe that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about activating and deactivating groups and the directing effects to figure out the order of substitution.

Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The substituents we're adding are nitro (a strong meta director), tert-butyl (which is bulky, but as an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director), and ethoxy (which is activating, ortho/para director as well, since it's an ether). But wait, ethoxy is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group via the lone pairs on oxygen. So, when adding substituents, the order and the directing effects will determine where each group attaches.

Wait, but the target molecule has three substituents, so we need to add them in such a way that each new substituent goes into the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Let me think about the nitro group first. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So if I add nitro first, the next substituents would go in the meta positions relative to nitro? But perhaps that's not the case because other substituents are activating.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first add the tert-butyl group, then the nitro, then the ethoxy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added early because it's a strong activating group, which can direct the next substituent.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3. So let me think about the order in which the substituents are added.

Let me think about all the possible steps:

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are:

Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3)

Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH2CH3)3?)

Wait, no, tert-butyl is (CH2)C(CH3)2, maybe. Wait, actually, tert-butyl is (CH3)3C-.

Position 3: nitro (NO2).

So, looking at the benzene ring, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are all adjacent. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps position 3 is across from position 1? No, wait, benzene is a hexagon. So positions 1, 2, and 3 would be consecutive, meaning each substituent is adjacent to the next.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Wait, maybe I should number the positions so that the substituents are in 1,2, and 3 positions. Let me think of benzene as a six-membered ring. So, let me imagine the positions as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 1 is at the top, 2 at top right, 3 at bottom right, 4 at the bottom, 5 at bottom left, and 6 at top left.

So, the target has substituents at 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, they are adjacent.

Wait, but that would imply that after adding two substituents, the third one is added in a position that's adjacent. But that's possible only if the directing effects allow that. Let's see.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction steps.

The question is about which sequence of reactions leads to the target. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

Each step is a reagent or a condition. Let's look at the options:

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, tert-butyl chloride is bulky; Friedel-Crafts typically doesn't work well with tert-butyl because the carbocation is too stable, but it can lead to carbocation rearrangements. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible here, but I'm not sure.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis? Maybe.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → possible acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxy group via an SN2 displacement.

viii) Fe/HCl → iron and HCl, maybe for some reaction like a reduction or for acid conditions.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, perhaps.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe for a different substitution.

iv) HNO3 again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Option D:

i) HNO3 first.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe something else.

iii) t-butyl chloride.

iv) HNO3 again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about the order of substitution.

Let's think about the substituents:

We have nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy groups.

But nitro is a meta director and deactivating, whereas ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating (ortho/para).

So, the order of adding substituents could affect where each group ends up.

If the first substituent is a strong deactivating group (nitro), it would direct incoming groups to the meta positions. But then, after adding nitro, if we add ethoxy, which is activating, it would direct next groups to ortho/para positions relative to ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe we add the activating groups first, which are easier to substitute, and then add the deactivating group.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it's harder to substitute after it's added.

So perhaps, the order is to first add the activating groups, then the deactivating group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the target structure.

The target has the ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Wait, that's a bit tricky because each substituent is adjacent. That suggests that each substitution is ortho to the previous.

But how?

Wait, when you have multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on which substituent is more activating, as more activating groups can dominate the directing.

Wait, but if a ring has multiple substituents, it's a bit more complicated. The substituents can have a combined directing effect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each step of the synthesis.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, let's imagine building this step by step.

Optionally, perhaps the steps are:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group.

2. Nitration to add nitro group.

3. Introduction of ethoxy group via some substitution.

But wait, introducing ethoxy group requires a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps through a diazonium salt or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Let me think about each substituent's introduction.

Adding tert-butyl first:

Benzene + AlCl3 and t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, but t-butyl is a bulky group. Friedel-Crafts typically prefers less hindered alkyl groups because the carbocation is more stable, but for t-butyl, the carbocation would be (CH3)3C+ which is very stable, so it could proceed. But sometimes, Friedel-Crafts can have issues with carbocation rearrangement, but t-butyl doesn't rearrange, so it should be fine. So benzene would get the t-butyl group in, say, para or ortho position. Wait, but benzene with a single substituent would have the next substituent in ortho, meta, or para based on directing.

Wait, first substituent is t-butyl, which is activating, so it will direct incoming groups to ortho and para.

So, after t-butyl is added, let's say it's at position 1. Then, nitration would add nitro group in positions 2 or 4 (ortho or para to t-butyl). But nitro is a meta director, but as a substituent, when added, it's influenced by the existing substituent.

Wait, when the ring has a substituent, the incoming group is directed by the substituents already present. So, when adding nitro to benzene with a t-butyl group, the t-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So the nitro group would tend to go into ortho or para positions relative to t-butyl.

But nitro groups are deactivating, so after that, adding another substituent would be more difficult.

Wait, but let's think about the target. The nitro is at position 3. Hmm, perhaps the order is different.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the nitro group being added at a certain position, and then the other groups.

Another possibility is adding the nitro group first. So, benzene is nitrated. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating group. Then, adding ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). But since nitro is deactivating, it would be harder to add these groups.

Alternatively, perhaps we first add the ethoxy group. Benzene is ethoxylation via, say, a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a diazonium salt decomposition.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts won't work for ethoxy because it's an ether and doesn't have a leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, perhaps after making a diazonium salt.

Wait, another approach: benzene can be nitrated first, then undergo some reactions to introduce the ethoxy and t-butyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which sequence adds the substituents in the correct order.

Looking at the options:

Each option has a series of steps. Let's see which option leads to the target.

Looking at the target structure, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, if I look at each option, I can see whether the steps would lead to such a substitution.

Option D starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl, then t-butyl chloride. Hmm. Let's see:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrates benzene. So we have nitrobenzene.

Then, ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction? Or perhaps it's for making a diazonium salt. Wait, Fe/HCl is often used in the diazotization step, but that's usually with NaNO2. Alternatively, Fe/HCl can be used in the presence of a nitro group for some kind of reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine, but with Fe/HCl, perhaps. So, if step ii is reduction of nitro group, then we would have aniline. But then, step iii is t-butyl chloride with AlCl3, which is Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Aniline is a strong activating group, so that would work. So after reduction, the ring is activated.

So, adding t-butyl chloride via Friedel-Crafts would introduce it into the ring. Where would it go?

Aniline has a strong activating NH2 group which is ortho/para directing. So, adding t-butyl would go into ortho or para to NH2.

But wait, after that, the next step is iv) HNO3 again. Hmm, but after adding t-butyl, the ring has substituents from the reduction and the alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that would require a leaving group. So, perhaps after making a nitro group, someone would need to have a leaving group in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But nucleophilic substitution on benzene rings usually requires strong activating groups (like amino) and a good leaving group already present.

So, perhaps the steps involve adding a nitro group, then a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline each option's steps.

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → probably reduces nitro group to NH2. So now, we have aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Aniline is strongly activating, so t-butyl would add ortho/para to NH2 group.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Now, the ring has NH2 and t-butyl groups. NH2 is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur ortho/para to NH2.

Wait, but now the ring has two substituents: NH2 and t-butyl.

But let's imagine that after step iii, we have aniline with a t-butyl group. Let's say the t-butyl is in the para position relative to NH2. Then, nitration in step iv would occur ortho or para to NH2, which is already occupied by t-butyl. Hmm, perhaps the nitro group would end up in the ortho position relative to NH2, which is adjacent to the t-butyl.

Then, step v is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. That would convert the NH2 group into a diazonium salt, which can undergo substitution.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Maybe to add a sulfonic acid group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So that might not be right.

Alternatively, maybe after generating the diazonium salt, we can perform a substitution with ethoxy group.

Wait, but to introduce an ethoxy group, perhaps we can use a diazonium salt and substitute it with an ethoxy group.

But wait, the ethoxy group is a good nucleophile, but under what conditions can it substitute a diazonium group? Diazonium salts typically require strong conditions, like those with H2O, H2SO4, and heat, which would lead to hydrolysis, producing a phenol. Alternatively, perhaps using a copper catalyst for coupling, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution where the diazonium group is replaced by something else.

Wait, but in any case, option D's steps don't seem to lead directly to the ethoxy group. Let me think again.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, benzene → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. Nitration of t-butylbenzene, which is activated, so nitration occurs ortho or para to t-butyl.

After nitration, we have a nitro group in the ortho or para position relative to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro group to NH2.

iv) HNO3 again → another nitration? That seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe Fe/HCl is for making a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps step iii is diazotization of the NH2 group formed from nitro.

Wait, but if step ii added nitro, then step iii could be making diazonium salt, but then step iv is another nitration? Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the ethoxy group introduction.

Looking for steps that introduce an ethoxy group, which is OCH2CH2CH3. How is that typically introduced?

One common method is via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and a strongly activated ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via an ether synthesis, like via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that’s usually for aliphatic ethers.

Wait, another approach is via a substitution of a nitro group, but that's tricky. Or perhaps via a diazonium salt decomposition, where the diazonium group is replaced by an ethoxy group.

Wait, in the presence of Cu, a diazonium salt can be coupled with an aryl halide (like in the Sandmeyer reaction), but that's for introducing halogens. Alternatively, perhaps using a diazonium salt and a nucleophile like ethoxide under specific conditions.

Wait, I'm not too confident about that. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, perhaps after making a nitro group into a good leaving group. For example, nitro groups can be converted into nitrofuranates or something else, but that's complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a leaving group. For example, if you have a nitro group in a position, and then convert it to a nitrofuranate (which is a good leaving group), then treat with ethanol to substitute.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl bromide, but I don't think that's possible because ethoxy is a strong activating group, but FC alkylation is for alkyl halides.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the ring is activated by a strong electron-donating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is present. For example, via a diazonium salt treatment.

Wait, perhaps let me think about the steps in option C.

Option C steps:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So, sulfonic acid group is added. Now, the ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid groups.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so that might not lead to the target.

Hmm, maybe not.

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration → nitro group added.

iii) SO3 → sulfonation → another group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → perhaps acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → possibly introducing ethoxy via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

ix) HNO3 → another nitration.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this might not fit.

Hmm.

Option B:

Looking at steps again:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl added.

ii) HNO3 → nitro group added. So t-butyl directs nitro to ortho or para.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to NH2.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again. So after having NH2 and t-butyl, nitration would be directed by NH2, which is strong activating. So nitro would go ortho/para to NH2. But position depends on existing substituents.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which would convert NH2 into diazonium.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis → produce phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps introducing ethoxy via SN2.

viii) SO3 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so maybe this isn't the right path.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2 → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl added ortho/para to NH2.

iv) HNO3 → nitro added again, directed by NH2 to ortho/para.

Wait, but after adding two nitro groups? The target has only one.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the order of substituent addition and the directing effects.

Let me think about the target structure: substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, ethoxy is at 1. Then, t-butyl is at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro is at 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl? Not sure).

But how to get that arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then the ethoxy, then the t-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, which would make it harder to add other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

So, let's imagine:

1. Benzene → introduce ethoxy group.

But how? Ethoxy is OCH2CH2CH3. To introduce that, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But benzene itself isn't reactive enough. Alternatively, perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something, but that's for ketones.

Alternatively, maybe via a diazonium salt. For instance, benzene is first nitrated, then reduced to aniline, then made into a diazonium salt, and then treated with ethanol in the presence of Cu (like in the Gattermann–Koch reaction?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Williamson ether synthesis, but that's usually for aliphatic systems.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced by substituting a nitro group. For example:

First, benzene is nitrated → nitrobenzene.

Then, the nitro group is converted into a nitroso or some other group that can be replaced by ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, if the ring has a nitro group and a meta-directing group, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence logically builds the target.

Looking back at the target: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, perhaps the order of addition is ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But that would require adding the nitro group in a position that's meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, let's see:

Option D's steps:

i) Nitro group added.

ii) Nitro is reduced to NH2.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-butyl.

iv) Nitro group added again.

But this would give two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have.

So, that's probably not the right path.

Option B's steps:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to NH2.

iv) nitro added again.

Hmm, not matching the target.

Option C:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) sulfonated.

iii) nitro added.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) nitro again.

Hmm, not matching.

Option A:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) nitro.

iii) sulfonated.

iv) NaNO2.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) nitro again.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps, but maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution.

Wait, in step vii of option A: NaOH and EtBr. That's a classic SN2 condition. So, perhaps that's where the ethoxy group comes in.

So, if we have a benzene ring with a t-butyl and nitro group, and then we perform an SN2 with EtBr in NaOH, perhaps substituting a leaving group.

But where would that leaving group come from? Maybe if a nitro group is converted into a good leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after nitrating and sulfonating, you have a good leaving group like a sulfonic acid, which can be replaced by ethoxide.

But in option A, step iii is sulfonation, so after nitration and sulfonation, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid groups.

Then, step iv is NaNO2 and HCl → diazotization. But what would that target? Maybe the sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group, so after making a diazonium salt, perhaps substitution occurs.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's try to think step by step.

Option A's steps:

i) t-butyl chloride → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro group added, directed ortho/para to t-butyl.

Assume it's added para, so positions are t-butyl at 1, nitro at 4 (if benzene is numbered such that t-butyl is at position 1, nitro at position 4).

iii) SO3 → sulfonated. Where would the sulfonic acid group go? It would be directed by the existing substituents. The t-butyl is activating (ortho/para), and nitro is deactivating (meta). The strongest director is t-butyl, so sulfonic acid would add ortho or para to t-butyl. Let's say para, so position 4 is already occupied by nitro. So, perhaps the sulfonic acid is added at position 3, which is meta to t-butyl, or position 2, ortho.

But wait, position 4 is nitro. So, the sulfonic acid may go into position 2 or position 6 (ortho to t-butyl), or perhaps position 3 or 5 (meta to t-butyl, but that's influenced by the nitro group as well).

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is added in a position para to the nitro group, which is position 1, which is already taken by t-butyl. So, maybe it goes meta to nitro, which is position 2 or 6. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Step iv: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But in option A, after sulfonation, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid groups. Which of these can form a diazonium salt? Only if there's an amino group, which isn't present in this case. Or perhaps, if the nitro group is converted into something else. But I don't think so. So maybe this step is for a different substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonated group is in a position that can be replaced by ethoxide.

Wait, step vii in option A is NaOH and EtBr. That's SN2 conditions. So, perhaps that's where the ethoxy group is introduced.

But how? The ring must have a good leaving group, like a bromide or a nitro group, but in this case, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid.

Wait, maybe the sulfonic acid group is converted into a leaving group. For example, perhaps sulfonic acid can be converted into a good leaving group under certain conditions, like treatment with a base. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is a leaving group, but under what conditions?

Hmm, I'm not sure. So perhaps option A isn't the correct sequence.

Option D:

i) Nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → nitro reduced to NH2.

iii) t-butyl added via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) Nitro added again.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group. So this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitro group being added last.

So, first add ethoxy, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, to add ethoxy group first, perhaps we can start with benzene, then introduce ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution. But benzene isn't nucleophilic enough, so maybe after making a nitro group and then converting it into a good leaving group.

Wait, benzene → nitro group (nitrobenzene) → convert nitro to a good leaving group, like nitrofuranate, then substitute with ethoxide.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps for that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a diazonium salt decomposition. So, benzene → nitro → reduced to amine → diazonium salt → decompose with ethanol to form ethoxy group.

Wait, let me think:

1. Benzene is nitrated → nitrobenzene.

2. Nitro group is reduced to NH2 (using Fe/HCl → aniline).

3. Aniline is treated with NaNO2 and HCl → diazonium chloride.

4. Diazonium chloride is treated with ethanol in presence of a catalyst (like Cu) to substitute the diazonium group with ethoxy group.

So, after these steps, we have ethoxybenzene.

Then, add the t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so after that, we can do Friedel-Crafts.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst and an alkyl halide.

So, t-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

But where would the t-butyl group add? Ortho or para to ethoxy.

Then, after adding t-butyl, we can nitrate.

But since ethoxy is ortho/para directing and activating, the nitro group would add ortho or para to ethoxy.

But wait, in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy at position 1 and adjacent to t-butyl at position 2.

Hmm, perhaps that arrangement is achieved if the nitro is added to the position ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting close. Let me outline this possible sequence:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium chloride.

4. Substitute with ethanol → ethoxybenzene.

5. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl ortho or para to ethoxy.

6. Nitrate the ring → add nitro group directed by ethoxy and t-butyl.

But where would the nitro group go? Let's say ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). Then, the nitro group would be directed by the ethoxy group, which is activating, so it would add ortho or para to ethoxy.

If the ethoxy is at 1, the nitro would go to position 3 (meta is 4, wait, no. Wait, for ethoxy at 1, the ortho positions are 2 and 6, para is 4.

So, if the nitro group adds to position 3, that would be meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-butyl at 2.

Wait, but that's what the target has: ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, can we get nitro to add at position 3?

Hmm, that's not ortho or para to ethoxy. So, perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added after t-butyl is added in a position that is ortho to both ethoxy and t-butyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that's directed by both substituents.

But this is getting a bit complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-butyl group.

3. Add nitro group.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after making the ring highly activated.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's more advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that's for ketones.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option where the ethoxy group is added via SN2 displacement.

Looking back at the options, option B's step vii is NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps that's where the ethoxy group comes in.

So, let's imagine:

After some steps, the benzene ring has a leaving group, perhaps a bromide, and then treated with NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute the bromide with ethoxy.

But in which option does that happen?

Looking at option B, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps the earlier steps create a bromide on the ring.

How?

Well, during nitration and sulfonation, perhaps a bromide is introduced, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ring has a nitro group and a bromide substituent. Then, in NaOH and EtBr, the bromide is substituted with ethoxy.

But how to get a bromide on the ring.

Wait, perhaps via a substitution reaction where a nitro group is converted into a bromide. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's usually for alkyl groups, not bromide.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a nitro group and a t-butyl group, and then a bromide is added via some method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a diazonium salt substitution.

Wait, in option B, after Friedel-Crafts, nitration, Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), another nitration, diazotization, etc. It's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is present.

Wait, let's think about the target again.

The target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-butyl at 2.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → add ethoxy group (position 1).

2. Ethoxy directs next substituent to ortho or para.

3. Add t-butyl (position 2, ortho to ethoxy).

4. Now, the ring has ethoxy and t-butyl. Both are activating, so the next substitution (nitro) would be directed by them.

But where would it go? The nitro group is a strong deactivating, so perhaps it's added in a position that's less hindered and perhaps influenced by both groups.

Wait, but if ethoxy is at 1, t-butyl at 2, then the available positions are 3,4,5,6. Nitro group would be directed by ethoxy and t-butyl. Since both are activating, perhaps the nitro group is added in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and adjacent to t-butyl (position 2).

But would that happen?

Alternatively, after adding ethoxy and t-butyl groups, the nitro group could be added in a position that's ortho to t-butyl, which is position 3.

Wait, so the steps would be:

- Add ethoxy.

- Add t-butyl.

- Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is added via a diazonium salt. Let me outline:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium salt.

4. Treat with ethanol and Cu → substitute with ethoxy.

So, now, benzene has ethoxy group.

Then, perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl adds ortho or para to ethoxy.

Assume it adds ortho → position 2.

Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2).

Then, nitrate → nitro group is added where?

The nitro group is directed by ethoxy and t-butyl. Both are activating, so the nitro group would go into either ortho or para to ethoxy, which are positions 2 and 4. But position 2 is already taken by t-butyl, so nitro would go to position 4.

But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl.

Hmm, that's not matching. Perhaps I need a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the t-butyl.

Wait, after adding ethoxy, add nitro, then add t-butyl.

So:

1. Benzene → ethoxy.

2. Nitrate → nitro added ortho or para to ethoxy.

3. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But then the positions would be:

Ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3, t-butyl at 2.

Which matches the target.

So how to achieve that.

Step 1: Add ethoxy.

How? As I thought earlier, via diazonium salt substitution.

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium chloride.

4. Treat with ethanol → ethoxybenzene.

Now, ethoxy is at position 1.

Step 2: Nitrate ethoxybenzene.

Ethoxy is activating, so nitration occurs ortho or para. Suppose nitro is added at position 3 (ortho to ethoxy is 2 and 6).

Step 3: Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated, which is the case because ethoxy is present. So, t-butyl would add ortho or para to ethoxy.

Ortho would be position 2, which is adjacent to nitro (position 3). So, t-butyl would be at position 2.

So now, positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro) → which matches the target.

So, the steps would be:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

iii) Diazotize → diazonium salt.

iv) Substitute with ethanol → ethoxybenzene.

v) Nitrate ethoxybenzene → nitro group at position 3.

vi) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl at position 2.

But looking at the options, I need to see which option has this sequence.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction to NH2.

iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

Wait, in this case, after adding t-butyl, nitration would occur in step iv.

But in the target, nitro is already present before adding t-butyl. So perhaps option D's steps don't fit.

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, perhaps this could fit.

Wait, let's outline the steps in option B:

1. Friedel-Crafts: add t-butyl to benzene → t-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration: nitro group added ortho/para to t-butyl, let's say para → position 4.

3. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline derivative.

4. Nitration again: with NH2 as director, nitro group would add ortho/para to NH2.

But in this case, the ring already has t-butyl and NH2 groups. So, the nitro group would be added ortho/para to NH2, perhaps position 2 or 6.

5. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of NH2.

6. H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis → phenol.

7. NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, looking again, the target has nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-butyl at 2.

In option D:

i) Nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) t-butyl added via FC → t-butyl at ortho or para to NH2.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again, directed by NH2.

So, after step iv, we have two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have. So that's not it.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A's steps:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) nitro added.

iii) sulfonated.

iv) diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) HNO3.

It's a long sequence. Let's think:

After step ii, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. Nitro is deactivating, so next steps would be difficult.

Then, step iii: sulfonated → now the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid.

Step iv: NaNO2 → but there's no NH2 group.

Hmm, this seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is converted into something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a nitro group into a good leaving group.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Maybe looking for the option where ethoxy is introduced via NaOH/EtBr, which is in steps vii of options A and B, and step vii of C, and step ix of D.

Assuming that step vii in option B is where the ethoxy is introduced.

So, in option B:

After steps i to vi, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and NH2 groups. Then, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which could substitute a bromide. But where would the bromide come from? Maybe it's introduced in step iv, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me summarize.

The target requires:

- Ethoxy at position 1.

- t-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

- Nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy, adjacent to t-butyl).

The correct order would be:

1. Introduce ethoxy.

2. Introduce t-butyl ortho to ethoxy.

3. Introduce nitro meta to ethoxy (which is adjacent to t-butyl).

So, the steps would be:

a. Benzene → ethoxy.

b. Ethoxy → t-butyl via FC.

c. t-butyl and ethoxy → nitro.

Looking at the options, which option follows this sequence?

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl → added to benzene.

ii) nitro → added to benzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iv) nitro again → perhaps not.

But that doesn't fit.

Option D:

i) nitro → benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → NH2.

iii) t-butyl → FC.

iv) nitro → again.

But that adds another nitro group, which we don't want.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to NH2.

iv) nitro added again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis (to phenol).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute with ethoxy.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → t-butyl.

2. Nitro added.

3. Nitro reduced to NH2.

4. Nitro added again → but the target only has one nitro.

So, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitro group being introduced after the ethoxy and t-butyl are in place.

So, the steps would be:

1. Benzene → ethoxy.

2. Ethoxy → t-butyl.

3. t-butyl and ethoxy → nitro.

Which option has that?

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) t-butyl added.

iv) HNO3 → nitro again.

But that adds two nitro groups, which doesn't fit.

Option C:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) sulfonated.

iii) nitro added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) nitro added.

Hmmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, I'm going to make a guess. The correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl → t-butyl added ortho/para to NH2.

4. Nitrate again → nitro group added ortho/para to NH2.

But that would give two nitro groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy and t-butyl, but that might be challenging.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the steps, the correct option is likely option D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option B.

Wait, wait a minute. Looking at the target, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the order of addition is ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

So, which option starts with nitration? None, except option D and A.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is:

1. Benzene → nitro.

2. Nitro → NH2.

3. NH2 → t-butyl.

4. NH2 → nitro (but that would add another nitro).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D: i) nitration, ii) reduction, iii) FC alkylation, iv) nitration again, etc.

But the target has only one nitro group, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B: i) FC alkylation, ii) nitration, iii) reduction, iv) nitration again.

But that adds two nitro groups.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about which option has the nitro group as the last substituent added.

Looking at the options:

Option D has nitration as step i and iv.

Option A has nitration as step ii and ix.

Option B has nitration as step ii and iv.

Option C has nitration as step iii and vi.

The target has only one nitro group, so the correct option must have nitration only once.

Looking at the options:

Only option D has two nitration steps. So, perhaps the correct option is not D.

Wait, looking again:

Option A: steps ii and ix are nitration.

So, two nitro groups. Not matching.

Option B: steps ii and iv → two nitro groups.

Option C: steps iii and vi → two nitro groups.

Option D: steps i and iv → two nitro groups.

Wait, that can't be right. The target has only one nitro group, so the correct option must have only one nitration step.

Wait, but all the options have multiple nitration steps. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Looking at the options:

Option A: steps ii and ix → two nitration steps.

Option B: steps ii and iv → two.

Option C: steps iii and vi → two.

Option D: steps i and iv → two.

But the target has only one nitro group. So, none of the options seem correct. But that's impossible because the question must have a correct option.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe one of the nitration steps in the options doesn't actually add a nitro group. For example, perhaps nitration is used for another purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps in one of the options, the nitration is performed after substituents that deactivate the ring, making it impossible to add a second nitro group.

But I'm not sure. Well, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so I'll make an educated guess based on the steps.

The correct sequence probably adds the ethoxy group last via a substitution. So, the step where NaOH and EtBr are used is where the ethoxy is introduced.

Looking at the options, option B has this step (step vii). So, perhaps the correct option is B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitration steps. The target has nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-butyl.

So, perhaps the nitro was added last, directed by the ethoxy group.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Nitrate, adding nitro meta to ethoxy (position 3).

Which would require the ethoxy to be present before nitration.

So, looking for an option where nitration is the last step after ethoxy and t-butyl are added.

Looking at the options, option B's last nitration step is step iv, which comes before substitution (step vii).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

I think I've spent enough time. I'll go with option D as the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Includes multiple nitration steps (steps ii and ix), which would result in more than one nitro group on the benzene ring, inconsistent with the target molecule.
   - The sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group (step iii), which is not present in the target molecule.
   - The ethoxy group is introduced via NaOH/EtBr (step vii), but the sequence does not logically lead to the correct substitution pattern.

2. **Option B**:
   - Starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group (step i).
   - Followed by nitration (step ii), which would place the nitro group ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
   - Reduction of the nitro group to NH₂ (step iii) and subsequent nitration (step iv) would introduce another nitro group, leading to an incorrect substitution pattern.
   - The ethoxy group is introduced via NaOH/EtBr (step vii), but the sequence does not align with the desired substitution order.

3. **Option C**:
   - Begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group (step i).
   - Includes sulfonation (step ii), which introduces a sulfonic acid group not present in the target molecule.
   - Nitration (step iii) and subsequent steps do not lead to the correct substitution pattern for the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - Starts with nitration (step i), introducing a nitro group on benzene.
   - Reduction of the nitro group to NH₂ (step ii) activates the ring for further substitution.
   - Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group (step iii), which would be ortho or para to the NH₂ group.
   - A second nitration step (step iv) introduces another nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule having only one nitro group.
   - The sequence does not logically lead to the correct substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly match the desired substitution pattern for the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is selected as the most plausible answer, despite its inconsistencies.

ANSWER: D
