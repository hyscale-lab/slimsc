Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again carefully.

The setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. The average Lorentz factor here is about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they can travel before decaying. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation comes into play. Wait, right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, and from the lab frame, it's gamma times longer. So the particles can travel further before decaying because their lifetime is longer from our perspective.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is c multiplied by gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So the formula is L = c * gamma * tau.

In the first scenario, when the Lorentz factor is 20, one third of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. That must mean that on average, the particles that reach the wall are those whose lifetime (gamma*tau) is enough to let them travel 30 meters before decaying. Because the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters before it hits the wall.

Wait, but why does one third reach the wall? Oh, maybe it's because only a fraction have enough lifetime to make it that far. So perhaps the particles are distributed in terms of their actual lifetime, such that only a third have a gamma high enough to allow them to reach 30 meters.

Wait, no, the problem states that on average, one third reach the wall. So perhaps the detection efficiency is based on the decay time. Let me think again.

Each particle has a proper lifetime tau. The time it experiences is tau, but from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, we can approximate speed as c. So the time is t = R / c, where R is 30 meters.

If the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than t, then it doesn't decay before reaching the wall. So the condition for a particle to reach the wall is gamma * tau > t.

So, t = R/(c). Let's compute that. R is 30 meters, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

So, for a particle to reach the wall, gamma * tau must be greater than 1e-7 seconds.

But wait, the problem mentions that when the Lorentz factor is 20, on average one third of them reach the detector walls. So perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution, and the number of particles that reach the wall is related to the probability that gamma tau > t.

Wait, the decay process is such that the probability a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t / tau). So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau))? Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the mean lifetime is gamma tau. Or wait, no, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by its proper lifetime. So the decay process in the lab frame is governed by a mean lifetime of gamma tau. Therefore, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The proper lifetime is tau. So in the particle's rest frame, it lives an average of tau. From the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the average lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay follows an exponential distribution with mean gamma tau.

So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In this problem, the time t for the particle to reach the wall is 30 m / c. So t = 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

So for each particle, the probability it hasn't decayed when it would take t = 1e-7 seconds is exp(-1e-7/(gamma tau)).

But wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the proper time the particle experiences is t' = t / gamma. Because time dilation says that the particle's clock runs slower. So the proper time for the particle to reach the wall is t' = t / gamma.

So the decay probability is based on the particle's own time. The particle's lifetime is tau, so the probability that it decays before reaching the wall is 1 - exp(-t' / tau) = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. The decay rate is given by the exponential distribution. The chance that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t / (gamma tau)). So the survival probability, which is the chance it hasn't decayed by time t, is exp(- t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay time is a random variable T with an exponential distribution: P(T < t) = 1 - exp( -t/(gamma tau) ). So the probability that the particle survives beyond time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So for the particle to reach the wall, the time it takes (t) must be less than the decay time (T). So P(reach wall) = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial scenario, with gamma = 20, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau)

So, ln(1/3) is -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So,

-1.0986 = -t/(20 tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = t/(20 tau)

So,

t = 20 tau * 1.0986

Wait, let me compute that. 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972, so t ≈ 21.972 tau.

Wait, but we know t is 1e-7 seconds. So 1e-7 = 21.972 tau => tau ≈ 1e-7 / 21.972 ≈ 4.556e-9 seconds.

Hmm, that's the proper lifetime. So for each particle, the proper lifetime is about 4.556e-9 seconds.

Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor gamma' is needed so that two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the wall. So the survival probability must be 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( - t/(gamma' tau) )

Take natural log:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma' tau)

ln(2/3) is about -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = - t/(gamma' tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = t/(gamma' tau)

We know t and tau:

t = 1e-7 s

tau ≈ 4.556e-9 s

So,

t/(gamma' tau) = (1e-7) / (gamma' * 4.556e-9) )

Compute denominator:

gamma' * 4.556e-9 = gamma' * 4.556e-9

So,

(1e-7) / (gamma' * 4.556e-9) = (1e-7) / (4.556e-9) ) * (1/gamma' )

Compute (1e-7)/(4.556e-9) = (1e-7) / (4.556e-9) = (1e2) / (4.556) ≈ 100 /4.556 ≈ 21.95.

So,

21.95 * (1/gamma') = 0.4055

So,

21.95 / gamma' = 0.4055

Solve for gamma':

gamma' = 21.95 / 0.4055 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 21.95 / 0.4055.

Well, 0.4055 is approx 0.4, so 21.95 / 0.4 is about 54.875.

Alternatively, exact calculation:

21.95 / 0.4055.

Compute 21.95 ÷ 0.4055.

0.4055 * 54 = 21.903.

Because 54 * 0.4 is 21.6, 54 * 0.0055 is 0.297, so 21.6 +0.297=21.897.

Which is very close to 21.95.

So 54 gives 21.897, which is just a bit less than 21.95.

So 54.8 would be needed. Because 54.8 *0.4055= ?

0.4055 *54 =21.897.

0.4055 *0.8= 0.3244. So, 21.897+0.3244=22.2214. Hmm, but we have 21.95 as the numerator. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently.

We have 21.95 * (1/gamma') = 0.4055.

So gamma' = 21.95 / 0.4055.

Let me compute this division.

21.95 ÷ 0.4055.

Let me compute 0.4055 * 54 = 21.897.

21.897 is less than 21.95 by 0.053.

So 0.053 / 0.4055 ≈ 0.13.

So the answer is approximately 54 + 0.13 ≈ 54.13.

So gamma' is approximately 54.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me re-express the equation.

We have:

gamma' = t/(tau * (ln(2/3)) )

Wait, no, because the initial equation was:

gamma' = t/( tau * (ln(2/3)) )

Wait no, let me re-derive.

The equation is:

ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma' tau)

Which rearranges to:

gamma' = - t/(tau * ln(2/3)) )

Because ln(2/3) is negative, so the negatives cancel.

So,

gamma' = t/( tau * |ln(2/3)| )

We have t=1e-7 s, tau≈4.556e-9 s.

So,

gamma' = (1e-7) / (4.556e-9 * 0.4055 )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute denominator first.

4.556e-9 * 0.4055 = approx 1.846e-9.

So,

gamma' = 1e-7 / (1.846e-9) ≈ (1e-7) / (1.846e-9) = (1e2) / 1.846 ≈ 100 / 1.846 ≈ 54.16.

So approximately 54.16, which is about 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

So the correct answer should be A) 54.

To determine the required Lorentz factor (γ') for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' decay probability and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability of a particle reaching the wall is given by:

\[
P(\text{reach wall}) = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \(t = \frac{R}{c}\) is the time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall, \(R = 30 \, \text{m}\) is the detector radius, \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Initial scenario (γ = 20)
For the initial Lorentz factor of \(\gamma = 20\), one-third of the particles reach the wall. Thus, the survival probability is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{20 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

Since \(\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986\), we have:

\[
1.0986 = \frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

Solving for \(\tau\):

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{20 \cdot 1.0986}.
\]

Substituting \(t = \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}\):

\[
\tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 4.556 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Desired scenario (two-thirds survival)
For two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall, the survival probability is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau}.
\]

Since \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055\), we have:

\[
0.4055 = \frac{t}{\gamma' \tau}.
\]

Substituting \(t = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}\) and \(\tau \approx 4.556 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}\):

\[
0.4055 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma' \cdot 4.556 \times 10^{-9}}.
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
0.4055 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma' \cdot 4.556 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{4.556 \times 10^{-9}} \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma'}.
\]

\[
0.4055 = \frac{21.95}{\gamma'}.
\]

Solving for \(\gamma'\):

\[
\gamma' = \frac{21.95}{0.4055} \approx 54.16.
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \(54\). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) 54**
