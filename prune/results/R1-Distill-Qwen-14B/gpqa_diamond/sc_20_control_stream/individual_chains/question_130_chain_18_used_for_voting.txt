Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars. They mention the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For neutral hydrogen clouds, their absorption would occur at a specific wavelength depending on their redshift. So if the cloud is moving away, the wavelength would be stretched, right?

Wait, the Lyman alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far ultraviolet. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light. So the question must be about when this absorption line shifts into the optical range, allowing us to detect it using ground telescopes.

So the idea is that for the absorption to be in the optical range (visible light), the redshift must be such that 1216 Angstroms multiplied by (1 + z) equals the optical wavelength. I think the optical range is roughly 400-700 nm, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is way into the UV. So we need to find the redshift z where 1216 * (1 + z) = some optical wavelength.

Wait, no, wait. The absorption line is observed. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 microns), when does this shift into the optical range, which is up to maybe 1 micron (1000 nm or 1 micrometer), but ground-based telescopes might not go as far as near-infrared, but for optical, maybe up to around 700 nm.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact boundary. Let me think: visible light is about 400-700 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 0.1216 microns, which is way UV. So we need to find z such that 1216 * (1 + z) = 400 nm, because if the observed wavelength is longer than 400 nm (visible), we can detect it with optical telescopes.

Wait, no. Wait, 400 nm is the lower end of visible light. So if the Lyman alpha line is observed at longer than 400 nm, then it's in the visible spectrum. So let's set up the equation:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z)

We want λ_obs to be at least 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms.

So 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000

Solving for z: 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29

So z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 4000 / 1216 is approximately what?

1216 * 3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 ≈ 0.289. So 3.289. So z≈2.289.

So the minimum redshift z is about 2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4, option D is 1.9. Hmm, 2.289 is between 2.29 and 2.3, so the lower limit would be just above 2.29, but the options are discrete.

Wait, but wait. If the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical, it needs to be at least in the visible range. But what's the maximum redshift we can observe? Because as z increases, the observed wavelength moves into longer wavelengths, which might be beyond optical. But we're looking for the lower limit. So the question is asking for the minimum z where the absorption line enters the optical range.

Wait, but if z is lower than that, the observed wavelength would be less than 400 nm, which is in the UV, and not detectable by ground-based optical telescopes. So the lower limit on z is the minimum z where λ_obs is 400 nm. So that gives us z≈2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than this. So the minimum z is about 2.29, so the lower limit would be just above 2.29. So the options given, the lower limit would have to be at least 2.3. But the options don't have 2.3, but they have 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the optical range is considered to start higher, maybe at 500 nm? Let me recalculate.

If we set λ_obs = 500 nm (5000 Angstroms), then 1 + z = 5000 / 1216 ≈ 4.099, so z≈3.099. So z≈3.1.

But then the answer would be A) 3, but that's higher than our previous calculation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The key is that the Lyman-alpha absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms. To be observed in the optical, it must be redshifted into the range that optical telescopes can detect, which is about 400-700 nm. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is just at 400 nm.

Wait, but perhaps the question is a bit different. It's about detecting the absorption line. If the Lyman alpha line is in the optical, then the cloud is at a high redshift. But for lower z, the line would be in UV, which we can't observe from the ground. So the lower limit on z is when the line enters the optical.

So the minimum z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29. So z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is z≈2.29. Now, looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimum z is ~2.29, so the lower limit would be just over 2.29. So the redshift must be higher than that to be detected. So the question is asking for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So the minimal z is ~2.29, so if the object has a redshift higher than this, it can be detected.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29, so that would be the lower limit. So the answer would be C)2.4.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. That is, what is the minimal z such that at this z, the Lyman alpha line is at the edge of optical. So any higher z would have it even farther into the optical. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any object with z higher than that would have the line in optical. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So any object with z≥2.29 would be detectable.

But the options don't have 2.29. The closest higher is 2.4 (option C) and the lower is 1.9 (option D). Wait, but wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000 → 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29, so z=2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the object must have a redshift higher than this to be detected. So the lower limit is z≈2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is above 2.29. So that would be the answer.

But wait, the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected". So the minimal z is 2.29. So any object with z≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29.

But the options don't have 2.29. The closest is option C)2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the answer would be C)2.4.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). To reach the near-ultraviolet, which is maybe around 300 nm, which is still not optical. Wait, no, optical is 400 nm and above.

Wait, no, 400 nm is violet. So wait, 1216 Angstroms is 0.1216 nm, which is 121.6 nm. So it's far UV. So when it redshifts beyond 400 nm (0.4 microns), it's in the visible. So the calculation is correct.

So the minimal z is 2.29. So the options given, the correct answer is option C)2.4, because 2.4 is the next higher option. Alternatively, maybe none of the options exactly match, but among the options, 2.4 is the closest higher value. So the answer is C.

Wait, but wait another point: Sometimes, ground-based telescopes can't observe some optical wavelengths due to the atmosphere. Like, certain parts are blocked. But the general idea is that the Lyman alpha line has to be in the visible range.

Wait, but another thing: I think the Lyman alpha forest refers to absorption lines in quasar spectra, which are observed in the optical range. But those are at higher redshifts. So for a quasar at z such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical. So yeah, the calculation is correct.

So putting it all together, the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, so the lower limit is around z=2.3. Looking at the options, the only one higher than that is C)2.4. So the answer is C.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) at which large clouds of neutral hydrogen can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift of the Lyman alpha absorption line. The emitted wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is approximately \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) (0.1216 µm), which lies in the far ultraviolet (FUV). Optical ground-based telescopes can only detect light in the visible range, approximately \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (0.4 µm) and longer.

The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is given by the redshift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z).
\]

To ensure the Lyman alpha line is detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 400 \, \text{nm}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} = 0.1216 \, \text{µm} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} = 0.4 \, \text{µm} \), we solve for \( z \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} = \frac{0.4}{0.1216} \approx 3.29.
\]

Thus, the redshift is:

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29.
\]

This means the Lyman alpha line will only be detectable in the optical range for objects with \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated minimum redshift of \( 2.29 \), so it is a valid but not the closest option.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than \( 2.29 \), so it is incorrect.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than \( 2.29 \), making it the closest and correct option.
- **D) 1.9**: This is also lower than \( 2.29 \), so it is incorrect.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for detecting the Lyman alpha line in the optical range is approximately \( z = 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C) 2.4**.
