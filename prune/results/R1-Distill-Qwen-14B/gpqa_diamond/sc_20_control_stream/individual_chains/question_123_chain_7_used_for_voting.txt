Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see. So the question is about figuring out the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, let's get the setup clear. The supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both are inertial frames, meaning no acceleration, right? So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That's really fast, like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So we're definitely dealing with relativistic effects here.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but time is different in different frames. So I think I need to use the Lorentz transformation here because of the relative motion between the two frames.

Let me think about the relationship between time in one frame and the other. So if t' is the time in the ejecta's frame, and t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, how do they relate? Oh right, the time dilation formula: t = gamma * (t' + (v x') / c²). Wait no, maybe I should think about the velocity and how it transforms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the velocity addition formula. Because the ejecta is moving at some velocity relative to the Galaxy. Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So according to the principle of relativity, the speed in the other frame would be the same magnitude but opposite direction. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, is that correct? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh wait, but in this case, since both are inertial frames and the motion is along a straight line, perhaps it's easier to use the velocity transformation formula.

Wait, no, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the original frame (Galaxy frame), u' is the velocity in the ejecta frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, but in this case, the ejecta's frame is moving at speed v relative to the Galaxy. Let me think: in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving with velocity u. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving with velocity -u (because velocities are opposite). So using the velocity addition formula, if the Galaxy observes the ejecta moving at u, then the ejecta's frame observes the Galaxy moving at u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait another approach: Since from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s (v=6e4 km/s), then from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity u = 6e4 km/s towards the Galaxy. Because in special relativity, the relative speed is the same as seen by both frames when considering motion along the same line. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the relativistic velocity addition formula would change it.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: Let's denote the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame as u. The velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame is given as v = 6e4 km/s (towards the ejecta). So using the velocity transformation, v = (u - v_ejecta_velocity) / (1 - (u * v_ejecta_velocity) / c² ). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to set up the frames.

Let me define the frames. Let S be the Galaxy frame, and S' be the ejecta's frame. The relative velocity between S and S' is v, which is the speed of S' relative to S. Wait, so S' is moving at velocity v as seen from S. Wait, but in this scenario, in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So from S' to S, the velocity is v = 6e4 km/s (since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta in S', so in S, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s towards the Galaxy).

So, the velocity u of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame (S) is 6e4 km/s.

Now, the time t' is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame. Well, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy frame is 6e4 km/s, so the distance would be u * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait a minute: the problem is that the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, that same event would take a different amount of time. So we need to find t, the time in the Galaxy's frame, and then multiply by u to get the distance.

So how to find t?

We can use the time dilation formula. But wait, time dilation is part of special relativity, so t = gamma * t' + (gamma - 1) * (x'/c²), where x' is the position in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, but in this case, what is x'?

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, where is the event (the passage of time)? The event is the ejecta at rest, and the Galaxy moving towards it. So in the ejecta's frame, the initial position x' is zero, right? Because the event is occurring at the location of the ejecta. So x' = 0. So the time dilation formula simplifies to t = gamma * t'.

But wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ). Let's compute that.

v is 6e4 km/s. Let me compute v/c: 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2.

So v = 0.2 c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062.

So t = gamma * t' => t ≈ 1.02062 * 50 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

Then, the distance in the Galaxy frame is u * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 6e4 * 51.031.

Wait, 6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 * 51.031 = Let me compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.031 = 60,000 * 1 =60,000 plus 60,000 * 0.031 = 1,860 → total 61,860.

So total distance is 3,000,000 + 61,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made an approximation with gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 6e4 km/s → 6e4 = 6 *10^4 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s → so (v/c)^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

1 - (v²/c²) = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. 0.96 is 96/100. sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10.

sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798 (since 9.8^2=96.04). So sqrt(96) ≈9.798 → 9.798/10=0.9798.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈1.0206... So 50 * 1.0206 is 51.03 seconds, as before.

So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = Let's compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000; 60,000 *1.03=61,800 → total 3,061,800 km.

But none of the options exactly match that. The options are A) 2,940,000; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the fact that in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' and the distance is not just u*t, but I'm mixing up frames.

Alternative approach: Let me think about the distance in the Galaxy frame. The question says that the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at 6e4 km/s. So the distance it travels in the Galaxy's frame over time t is u*t.

But what is the time t in the Galaxy's frame that corresponds to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, perhaps we can relate t and t' using the Lorentz transformation.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the event is that the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy moves towards it. So in S', the time is t', and the position is x'=0.

In the Galaxy's frame (S), the position x and time t are related via the Lorentz transformation:

x = gamma (x' + v t')

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

But since x'=0, these simplify to:

x = gamma v t'

t = gamma t'

So the time in the Galaxy frame is t = gamma * t'.

So t = gamma * 50.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels is x = u * t.

Wait, but u is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is 6e4 km/s, as established earlier.

So x = u * t = u * gamma * t'

Wait, but u is v, the relative speed between the frames. Because the ejecta's frame is moving at speed v =6e4 km/s relative to the Galaxy.

Wait, wait, u is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is v=6e4 km/s.

So then x = v * t = v * gamma * t'

So let's compute x:

gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.02062.

v=6e4 km/s, t'=50 s.

So x=6e4 * 1.02062 *50.

Wait, 6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

Multiply by 1.02062: 3,000,000 * 1.02062 = 3,061,860 km.

So that's approximately 3,061,860 km. But the options given are D) 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So probably option D is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach could be to consider that the distance in the Galaxy's frame is x = u * t. But t is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame. Since the ejecta's frame is moving at speed v, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is shorter due to time dilation.

Wait, but no, time dilation isn't the issue here because the events are at the same location in the ejecta's frame. So the time in the Galaxy frame is longer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the time in the Galaxy frame is longer. Let me think: if the ejecta is moving at high speed towards the Galaxy, then in the Galaxy's frame, the time between two events (say, the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame) would be longer because of time dilation. So using the formula t = gamma * t', which we have done.

So the calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 3,061,860 km, but the closest option is D) 3,060,000. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the gamma factor and just compute it as 6e4 *50=3e6, which is option B. But the problem states that both are inertial frames, so we can't ignore relativity; otherwise, the answer would be 3e6, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation, which is necessary here.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Another possibility is that in the ejecta's frame, the time is t', and the distance the ejecta moves is x' = v' * t', where v' is the speed of the ejecta in the ejecta's frame. But wait, no, in the ejecta's frame, it's at rest. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the distance covered would be the distance the Galaxy has moved, which is v' * t', but that's not relevant to the problem's question.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the proper time. But proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. The ejecta is moving, so its proper time is t', and the Galaxy's frame measures a longer time t.

So, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is u * t = u * gamma * t'.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can compute gamma more accurately.

v =6e4 km/s → v = 0.2c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620725.

So t = gamma * t' → 50 * 1.020620725 ≈51.03103625 s.

Distance = 6e4 km/s *51.03103625 s = 6e4 *51.03103625.

Compute 6e4 *51 = 3,060,000 km. Then, 6e4 *0.03103625=60,000 *0.03103625= approx 1,862.175 km.

So total is approximately 3,060,000 +1,862.175 =3,061,862.175 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. So why isn't the option exactly matching? Perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, giving 50 *1.02 =51, leading to 6e4 *51=3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to use the approximation that gamma is approximately 1 when v is much less than c. But wait, v is 0.2c, which is significant. So that's not a good approximation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to not involve relativity, but that can't be because the speed is a significant fraction of c. So the correct approach must involve relativity.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame, which is the proper length, whereas the ejecta's frame measures a contracted length. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, the proper length is the length in the rest frame of the object. So in this case, the distance between the supernova and the Galaxy's center is a proper length in the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, this length would be contracted. Hmm, but the time measured is in the ejecta's frame, so perhaps the distance the ejecta travels is proper length times the time, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply using the classical approach, which would give the distance as 6e4 km/s *50 s =3e6 km, which is option B. But that's incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation, so the distance should be larger than 3e6.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, it's about 3,061,862 km, which is approximately 3,062,000 km, which isn't one of the options, but the closest is D)3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate using gamma as 1.02, which gives exactly 3,060,000 km.

So, if gamma is approximately 1.02, then t =50 *1.02=51 s.

Distance is 6e4 *51 =3,060,000 km.

So the answer would be D.

But wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma = 1/sqrt(0.96) = 1/(0.9798) ≈1.020620725.

So 1.020620725 *50 =51.03103625.

So 6e4 *51.03103625 =6e4 *51.03103625= 3,061,862.175 km.

So the exact value is approximately 3,061,862 km, but the option D is 3,060,000, which is about 1,862 km less. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to the relative velocity. So it's a simple time dilation, leading to distance u * t.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Maybe the distance is calculated using the proper time in the ejecta's frame, but that doesn't fit because the proper time is in the rest frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple relative velocity problem without considering time dilation, which would give option B, but that would be incorrect in a relativity context.

Wait, let's think again. The problem states that both are inertial frames, so relativity must be considered. So the correct approach is to use time dilation, leading to gamma * t' for the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But given that the options don't exactly match, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, considering gamma as approximately 1.02.

So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion and time dilation between the ejecta and the Galaxy. The ejecta is moving at a speed of \( u = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) towards the Galaxy's center in the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at the same speed (\( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \)).

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   Using time dilation in special relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Here, \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so \( v/c = 0.2 \). Substituting:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.02062
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = 1.02062 \times 50 \approx 51.031 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = u \cdot t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.031 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,862 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Matching with the Options**:  
   The closest option to the calculated distance is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to option D. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the problem setup or the options provided.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

**Answer: D**
