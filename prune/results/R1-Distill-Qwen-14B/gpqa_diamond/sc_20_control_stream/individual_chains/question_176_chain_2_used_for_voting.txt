Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it again. 

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a normalized vector. Oh wait, maybe I should normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? So the norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components.

Let me calculate that. The state is (-1, 2, 1). So the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Sum is 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector |ψ> is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Okay, now the problem is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So I think I need to find the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and then when you measure Q, you get -1. But wait, the measurements are sequential, so after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, the state for measuring Q is in that eigenstate of P.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P and Q. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

Let me look at operator P's matrix again. The matrix for P is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about what P represents. Wait, the matrix looks symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense because P is an observable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that P has a particular structure. Let me think: the matrix has non-zero elements on the off-diagonal. So maybe the eigenvalues can be found by looking for symmetries or patterns.

Alternatively, maybe I can try to compute the characteristic equation. The matrix for P is:

[ 0          1/sqrt(2)     0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)   0           1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0          1/sqrt(2)     0        ]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (P - λI) = 0.

So the matrix is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

Compute the determinant:

| -λ       1/√2      0    |
|1/√2     -λ      1/√2 | 
| 0       1/√2     -λ    |

Hmm, calculating the determinant. Maybe expanding along the first row.

The determinant would be:

-λ * det( [ -λ   1/√2; 1/√2  -λ ] ) 
- (1/√2) * det( [1/√2  1/√2; 0    -λ ] )
+ 0 * det(...) 

So first term: -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] = -λ [ λ² - 1/2 ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ] = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/2

Third term is zero.

So putting it all together:

determinant = -λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

Wait, no. Wait: Let me compute each part. Expanding:

First term: -λ * (λ^2 - (1/√2)^2 ) = -λ*(λ² - 1/2 )

So that's -λ^3 + (λ * 1/2 )

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ) ] = - (1/√2) * ( -λ/√2 )

Which is - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) ) = ( λ )/2 (because 1/√2 * 1/√2 is 1/2, and the negatives cancel.)

So the determinant is:

( -λ^3 + (λ/2 ) ) + ( λ/2 )

So combine the terms:

-λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ

Set determinant to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ(1 - λ² ) =0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. Oh, interesting. So possible outcomes for P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, the problem says that when measuring P, we get 0. So we're interested in the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

So let's find the eigenvectors for P with λ=0.

The equation (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So,

First row: 1/sqrt(2) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2) v1 + 1/sqrt(2) v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Third row: 1/sqrt(2) v2 = 0 → same as first row, v2=0.

So the eigenvector has v2=0, v1 = -v3. Let me write it as (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. So the vector can be written as v1 (1, 0, -1). To make it a unit vector, we can normalize it.

The vector (1, 0, -1) has a squared norm of 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenvector for P=0 is |p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, or maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, let me plug |p0> into P.

P |p0> = 

First component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*(0) + 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = 0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(0) + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) → (1/2) - (1/2) = 0.

Third component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) =0.

So yes, it gives (0,0,0), which is 0 times |p0>, so correct.

So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to |p0>.

Now, after that, we measure Q. The operator Q is given by:

[1   0   0]
[0   0   0]
[0   0  -1]

Okay, so Q is a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1.

So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors of Q are the standard basis vectors, because it's diagonal.

So |q1> is (1,0,0), |q0> is (0,1,0), |q-1> is (0,0,1).

Wait, but let me check. For eigenvalue 1: Q|q1> =1*|q1>, so yes.

Eigenvalue 0: any vector in the second component (y-axis) would be an eigenvector, but since the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

But for our purposes, after measuring P and getting 0, the state is |p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

We need to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1. So we have to project |p0> onto the eigenvectors of Q corresponding to -1, which is |q-1> = (0,0,1).

So the probability is the square of the amplitude of |q-1> in |p0>.

The amplitude is the inner product <q-1 | p0> = (0, 0, 1) · (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) ) = 0 + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/2).

So the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Because when you first measure P, the state collapses to |p0>, and then when you measure Q, the probability of getting -1 is the modulus squared of the component of |p0> in the |q-1> direction.

Yes, that's correct. Because |q-1> is (0,0,1), and |p0> has a component of -1/sqrt(2) in that direction.

So the probability is ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )² = 1/2.

But wait, wait. The first part is to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So the initial state is |ψ> = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

We need to project |ψ> onto each of P's eigenstates and find the probability of getting 0 for P.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the initial state is |ψ>, and when you measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of |p0> in |ψ>.

So the initial state is not necessarily the same as |p0>. So I think I messed that part up earlier.

Oh no, I see. Because the initial state is given, I need to first find the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then, given that, the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities, but wait—no, because if the state collapses after the first measurement, the second measurement is on the new state.

So the correct approach is:

1. Compute the probability that the first measurement (of P) yields 0. This is |<p0 | ψ>|².

2. Compute the probability that, in the new state (which is |p0>), the measurement of Q yields -1. This is |<q-1 | p0> |².

Multiply these two probabilities to get the combined probability.

Wait, no. Because the state after the first measurement is |p0>, and then the second measurement is performed on that state. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P and the probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0.

So the total probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0).

But let's compute each step.

First, compute P(P=0):

The eigenvector for P=0 is |p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The initial state is |ψ> = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The inner product <p0 | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

So that's [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].

Which is (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So denominator is 2*sqrt(3).

So (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3).

So P(P=0) = 1/3.

Second, given that the state is |p0>, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is |<q-1 | p0> |².

As computed earlier, <q-1 | p0> is -1/sqrt(2). The square of the absolute value is 1/2.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, that's option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I did everything correctly.

Wait, the initial state is |ψ> and we measure P. The probability is | <p0 | ψ> |² = (1/3).

Then, the state becomes |p0>. When we measure Q, the probability of getting -1 is | <q-1 | p0> |² = 1/2.

So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

The state of the system is given as a column vector \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{pmatrix} \), which is normalized. The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 
1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 0, 1, -1 \), with the eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) being \( |p_0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is given by the squared overlap between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |p_0\rangle \):

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle p_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}} \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the state \( |p_0\rangle \). The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with the eigenvector corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) being \( |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) in the state \( |p_0\rangle \) is given by the squared overlap:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle|^2 = \left| \langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
