Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, right? So the potentials would be related to those fields.

The question gives me a charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and I need to find the potentials V and A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup involves vectors r (position of the observation point), d (vector from the charge's position at tr to r), and the velocity v at time tr.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the potentials are usually calculated using retarded times because the fields from a moving charge depend on where the charge was earlier. So the potentials at time t depend on the charge's position and velocity at a time tr, which is earlier. So tr = t - (r·d)/(c), maybe? Or something like that. Or perhaps the distance is involved with c in the denominator.

I remember that the scalar potential V is usually (q/(4πε₀)) times something over the distance. But when the charge is moving, it's not just 1/r anymore. Oh right, because of the retarded time, the expression for V might involve a term like 1/(r - (v/c)(t - tr)) or something. Wait, no, that's more like the expression for the electric field. Hmm.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the same form as the static case but with the distance adjusted for the retarded time. Oh wait, no, the scalar potential is actually similar to the static case because potentials don't have the same kind of retardation as fields do. Or do they? I'm a bit confused here.

Actually, I think the scalar potential is still given by the same formula as the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1/|r - r'(t_r)|, where r' is the position of the charge at tr. Oh, but in this problem, the observation point is r, and the vector d is from where the field was generated (the charge's position at tr) to r. So d = r - r'(tr). Therefore, |d| is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, but in the options, the denominators are given in terms of d multiplied by c and the dot product of d and v. So looking at the options:

Option C: V is qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μo qc v)/(4π (dc -d·v)).

Wait, the denominator is (d c - v·d? Or is it d c - v·d? Or maybe it's (d c - d·v). Hmm.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is: V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|) * [1/(1 + (v·d)/(c² d)))]? Or something along those lines. Or perhaps it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/ (d - (v/c) t Retarded)).

Wait maybe it's better to think about the retarded potential expressions. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| - (v/c) t_retarded ) ]? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀/(4π)) times the integral of the current density over space. But for a point charge, the current is J = q v δ(...). Wait, but I think the vector potential can be written as A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × something) / (something squared).

Wait, but perhaps the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity v of the charge at the retarded time. So for a stationary charge, V would be q/(4πε₀ r), and A would be zero. When the charge is moving, the scalar potential might change because of the motion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, the potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

And the vector potential A(r, t) would be [μ₀ q/(4π)] * [ (v × d) / ( |d| ( |d| c² - v·d ) ) ].

Hmm, that seems complicated. Looking at the options, option C has in the denominator (d c - d·v), but wait, that's not the same as |d| c² - v·d. Because d is a vector, so d c would be c times the vector d. Hmm, maybe the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally because c has units of m/s, d is meters, so c times d would be meters^2/s, and v·d would be (m/s) * m = m²/s. So their difference is in the same unit, which is fine.

Wait, let me think. The denominator in option C is (d c - d · v). So that's c multiplied by the vector d, minus the dot product of d and v. So the denominator is a vector expression, but the entire denominator would be a vector? No, because in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), but that would be a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking again: Option C says V(r,t) = ( q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ) and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d·v)) but with d being a vector scaled by c, so d c is vector, and d·v is a scalar. So that doesn't add. Hmmm, perhaps the denominator in the options is actually written as (d c - (d · v)) but perhaps it's intended to be [c |d| - (d · v)].

Wait, but I'm trying to recall the correct expressions for V and A. Let me think about the Liénard's result for the potentials.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

And the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v × d) / ( |d| ( |d| c² - v·d ) ) ]

Wait, but if I factor that expression, the denominator is |d| ( |d| c² - v·d ) = c² |d|² - (d · v).

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let's compute the denominator in terms of d and v.

Wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - r(tr). The velocity v is at time tr.

Wait, so the denominator for V would involve the term [c² |d| - (d · v)], but in the options, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v). Wait, that can't be, because d is a vector, c is a scalar, so d*c is a vector, and d · v is a scalar. So adding them wouldn't make sense.

So perhaps the options have a typo, but assuming they mean [c |d| - (d · v)], which is a scalar. Let me rewrite option C's denominator as [c |d| - (d · v)].

So option C's V would be (qc)/(4πε₀) * 1/(c |d| - (d·v)/c² * c |d| ? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is [c |d| - (d · v)].

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v), which is a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is to think about the expressions for V and A when we're working in the Lorenz gauge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the general expressions.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r(tr)|)] * [ 1/(1 - (v · (r - r(tr)))/(c² |r - r(tr)|) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ |r - r(tr)| ]^{-1} / [ 1 - (v · d)/(c² |d|) )

Where d = r - r(tr).

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * [ (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / ( |r - r(tr)| ( c² |r - r(tr)| - v · (r - r(tr)) ) ) ]

So, if I let d = r - r(tr), then |d| is the magnitude.

So, the denominator for V is [ |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ] = [ |d| - (v·d)/c² ]

Similarly, the denominator for A is |d| ( c² |d| - v·d )

So, the denominator would be c² |d|² - (v · d)

Hmm, but none of the options seem to present this exactly. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), A = (μo q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v))

Wait, the denominator in V is (d c - d·v). But wait, d is a vector, so d c is a vector. d·v is a scalar. So this is a vector minus a scalar, which isn't possible. So perhaps the options have a typo, and the denominator is [c |d| - (d · v) ].

Wait, but that would make the denominator a scalar. So if that's the case, then let's see:

So for option C, V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d·v)) ), and A is (μo q c v )/(4π (c |d| - (d·v)) )

Comparing this to the expressions I derived earlier:

V = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

V = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² |d| ] / ( c² |d| - (v · d) )

= [ q c² |d| ] / [4πε₀ (c² |d| - (v · d)) ]

Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) as 1/( [c² |d| - (v·d)]/(c² |d|) ) ) = c² |d| / (c² |d| - (v·d)).

So V becomes [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [1/( |d| ) ] * [ c² |d| / (c² |d| - (v·d)) ) ]

Simplify: [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² |d| ] / ( |d| (c² |d| - (v·d)) ) ) → [ q c² ] / (4πε₀ (c² |d| - (v·d)) )

Which would make V = ( q c² ) / [4πε₀ (c² |d| - (v·d)) ]

But looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), but if dc is c multiplied by the vector d, that doesn't fit. Unless dc is actually c |d|. Then option C's V would be ( q c ) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - (d·v)) ].

Which is q/(4πε₀ (|d| - (d·v)/(c)) )

Wait, but that's not the same as our expression. Because our expression is [ q c² ] / [4πε₀ (c² |d| - d·v) ) ].

So unless in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - (d·v)), then the option would have V as (q c)/(4πε₀) * 1/(c |d| - (d·v)).

Which would be V = (q)/(4πε₀) [ c/(c |d| - (d·v) ) ] → V = q/(4πε₀) [ 1/( |d| - (d·v)/(c) ) ]

Hmm, that doesn't match what I have, which is [ c² |d| - (d·v) ] in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the denominator in terms of c squared, so let's factor that:

c² |d| - (d·v) = c² ( |d| ) - (d · v )

Which is a scalar. So the denominator is c² |d| - (d · v).

So V would be (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - d·v) )

But none of the options have this. Let me check the options again.

Option C: V = ( q c ) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ]

Assuming that (d c) is c multiplied by vector d, which I don't think makes sense because you can't multiply a vector by another vector. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the denominator is (d × c), but that's a cross product, which isn't in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × d) / [ (c² |d|² - (d·v)) ) ]

Wait, no, from earlier, the denominator is c² |d|² - (d·v). So the denominator is indeed a scalar.

Wait, but in the options, the denominator for A is (d c - d·v), which in terms of vector operations, that doesn't make sense.

Wait another thought: maybe the denominator in the options is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is a scalar. So option C's denominator is written as (d c - d·v), but perhaps it's a typo and should be (c |d| - d·v).

If that's the case, then option C's V would be:

V = ( q c )/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d·v)) )

And the A would be:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - (d·v)) )

Wait, but let's compare with the expressions I derived.

Earlier, I had V as ( q c² )/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - (d·v)) )

So that's q c² over denominator.

Option C's V is q c over a denominator (c |d| - d·v ), which is the same as (q c )/( c (|d| - (d·v)/(c) )) → same as q/( |d| - (d·v)/(c) )

But my expression is V = ( q c² )/( c² |d| - (d·v) )

Which is [ q c² ] / [ c² (|d|) - (d·v) ]

So if I factor c from denominator, it's c [ c |d| - (d·v)/c ].

Wait, but perhaps c² |d| - (d·v) = c (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

So the denominator in V is c (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

So V can be written as ( q c² ) / [ c (c |d| - (d·v)/c ) ] ) → q c / (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

Which is V = ( q c ) / (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps the correct option isn't among them, but that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Alternative approach: The potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'| ) d^3 r'

But for a point charge, ρ is a delta function, so:

V = (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/|r - r(tr)| * [ 1/(1 - (v · (r - r(tr)) )/(c² |r - r(tr)|) ) ]

Which is [ q/(4πε₀) ] * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) )

Which is [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² |d| ] / (c² |d| - v·d )

So V = [ q c² ] / [ 4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) ]

But looking at the options, none of them have c² in the numerator. Let's see each option:

Option A: V is (q)/(4πε₀ r) → but r is |d|, so this is the static potential. It doesn't include any velocity terms, so probably incorrect because the charge is moving, so the potential depends on velocity.

Option B: Same V as A, but A is (v^2 / c²) V. So their A is proportional to v squared. That doesn't sound right because the vector potential should involve the velocity v, not v squared.

Option C: V has q c in numerator, denominator (dc - dv). If dc is c |d|, then denominator is (c |d| - v·d), which would make the V expression (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

Which is different from our derived V, which is (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d ) )

So unless there's a factor of c missing, perhaps option C has V scaled by 1/c.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression. Let me think again. The denominator in V is (c² |d| - v·d ), so V is (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

Which can be written as [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² / (c² |d| - v·d ) ]

So the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d ), which is a scalar.

Looking at option C's denominator: (dc - d·v) → if dc is c |d|, then the denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which is the same as (c² |d| - v·d ) divided by c.

So (c |d| - (d·v) ) = ( c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So, option C's denominator is (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So V in option C is:

( q c ) / [ 4 π ε₀ ( (c² |d| - v·d ) / c ) ] → ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Which matches my derived expression for V.

Oh! So if that's the case, then option C has V correct.

Now, checking the vector potential A.

From earlier, A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × d) / [ (c² |d|² - v·d ) ]

But wait, (c² |d|² - v·d ) → because |d| is the magnitude, |d|² is d · d. So denominator is c² (d · d) - (v · d )

Which is a scalar.

Option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (dc - d·v) )

Again, assuming dc is c |d|, denominator is (c |d| - v·d )

Which is (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So A in option C has denominator (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So A in option C is:

(μ₀ q c v) / [4 π ( (c² |d| - v·d ) / c ) ) ] → (μ₀ q c v ) * c / [4 π (c² |d| - v·d ) ]

= (μ₀ q c² v ) / [4 π (c² |d| - v·d ) ]

But from my earlier expression, the correct A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × d) / (c² |d|² - v·d )

Wait, no. Because in the vector potential, the denominator is c² |d|² - (d · v )

Which is the same as (c² d² - (d · v) )

So, the denominator is (c² d² - (d · v) )

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) )

So, A in option C would have denominator (c |d| - (d · v) ) = [ c² d² - (d · v ) c ] / c.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute A as:

A = (μ₀ q v × d ) / [ (c² |d|² - (d · v )) * (4π) ]

But in option C, A is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So, let's compute the denominator in option C:

(c |d| - (d · v) ) → which is (c² |d|² - (d · v) c ) / |d| ?

Wait, not sure. Perhaps there's a mistake in the vector potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c) ) * [ (v × d) / ( ... ) ]

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Let me think about the correct expression for A.

In the standard treatment, the vector potential due to a moving point charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / [ (c² |r - r(tr)|² - (v · (r - r(tr)) ) c² ) ]

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, I think it's:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * ( r - r(tr) ) / |r - r(tr)| × [ 1/(1 - (v · (r - r(tr)) )/(c² |r - r(tr)| ) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the potentials:

The vector potential for a moving charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * [ v × (r - r(tr)) ] / [ (r - r(tr)) · (r - r(tr)) - (v · (r - r(tr)) ) t_r ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the given options.

Looking at option C, the vector potential is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (dc - d·v) )

Assuming dc is c |d|, so denominator is (c |d| - d·v )

Then, A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d·v ) )

But from the correct expression, I think the vector potential should have a factor of (v × d) in the numerator and (c² |d|² - (d·v )) in the denominator.

Wait, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answers are option C, because V matches correctly when considering the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the A expression. Let me think about the relation between vector potential and magnetic field.

The magnetic field B is given by the curl of A. For a moving charge, B is (μ₀ q)/(4π) [ (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / ( [r - r(tr)]² (1 + (v·r)/(c² |r|) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Liénard's formula for the fields. The electric and magnetic fields are given by:

E = (1/(4πε₀)) [ (q (1 - β² · ) ) / (γ² r²) ) ] ... but this might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Suppose the charge is moving with velocity v. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × r) / (r² - (v·r) t /c² )

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential for a moving charge is given by:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / ( |r - r(tr)| ( |r - r(tr)| c² - v · (r - r(tr)) ) )

Which would make the denominator (c² |d|² - (d · v) )

So, the denominator is (c² |d|² - (d · v) )

So, the vector potential A is:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × d ) / ( c² |d|² - (d · v) )

Which can be written as (μ₀ q )/(4π) (v × d ) / ( |d| (c² |d| - (d · v)/|d| ) )

But wait, (d · v ) is a scalar, and |d| is the magnitude of d, so (d · v ) / |d| is the projection of v onto d.

Hmm, but the denominator in option C is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar.

So to match, perhaps the vector potential in option C is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v) ) )

But that doesn't include the cross product (v × d), as it should in the numerator. So none of the options seem to have the cross product, which suggests that perhaps the question is not considering the cross product, but only the magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming non-relativistic speeds or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's using a simplified version where the vector potential is in the same direction as v.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the structure of the options.

Option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - dv) ), and A as (μo q c v)/(4π (dc - dv) )

So, V and A have the same denominator. So, A is (μo c v ) * V / (4π) (since in option C, V is ( qc/(4πε₀ (denominator) ) ), and A is (μo q c v )/(4π (denominator) ) )

So, A = (μo c v )/(4π) * [ q/(4πε₀ (denominator)) ]^{-1} * V ?

Wait, perhaps not, better to compute the ratio of A to V.

In option C,

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (dc - dv) )

V = ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (dc - dv) )

So A = (μ₀ c v )/(4 π ) * V * (4 π ε₀)/(q c )

Wait, that's messy. Alternatively, A = [ (μ₀ c v )/(4 π) ] * [ 1/(4 π ε₀) ) ]^{-1} * V ?

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of A to V is (μ₀ c v )/( ε₀ )

But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, (c² |d| - (d · v )) ≈ c² |d|, so V becomes (q c²)/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ) → V = q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), which is the static potential. Similarly, A would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π c² |d| ) ) → (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| )

But that's for non-relativistic, but the question doesn't specify that.

But looking back at the options, option B has V as (q)/(4 π ε₀ r ), which is the static case, and A as (v²/c²) V. But the vector potential in reality would involve the velocity v, not v squared.

Hmm, perhaps option B is incorrect because it's using v squared.

Wait, but option C seems to have the correct structure, with both V and A depending on the denominator (dc - dv), which, if interpreted correctly, would align with the derived expressions.

So, after this long thought process, I think the correct option is C.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded potential formalism. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) depend on the charge's position \( \vec{r}(t_r) \) and velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), as well as the vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}(t_r) \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \): This is the static scalar potential, valid for a stationary charge. However, the problem involves a moving charge, so this cannot be correct.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): The vector potential involves \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \).  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \): Same issue as Option A; it does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): While this has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \), the scalar potential \( V \) is still static, making this option invalid.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This matches the derived expression for the scalar potential when interpreted with \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) as the dot product and \( d c \) as \( c |\vec{d}| \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This aligns with the expected form of the vector potential, where the numerator involves \( \vec{v} \) and the denominator is the same as in \( V \).  
   **Conclusion**: Correct.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the derived expression, which involves \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): Similarly incorrect due to the wrong sign in the denominator.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Option C correctly captures both the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge, consistent with the retarded potential formalism. 

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, right? So the potentials would be related to those fields.

The question gives me a charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and I need to find the potentials V and A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup involves vectors r (position of the observation point), d (vector from the charge's position at tr to r), and the velocity v at time tr.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the potentials are usually calculated using retarded times because the fields from a moving charge depend on where the charge was earlier. So the potentials at time t depend on the charge's position and velocity at a time tr, which is earlier. So tr = t - (r·d)/(c), maybe? Or something like that. Or perhaps the distance is involved with c in the denominator.

I remember that the scalar potential V is usually (q/(4πε₀)) times something over the distance. But when the charge is moving, it's not just 1/r anymore. Oh right, because of the retarded time, the expression for V might involve a term like 1/(r - (v/c)(t - tr)) or something. Wait, no, that's more like the expression for the electric field. Hmm.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the same form as the static case but with the distance adjusted for the retarded time. Oh wait, no, the scalar potential is actually similar to the static case because potentials don't have the same kind of retardation as fields do. Or do they? I'm a bit confused here.

Actually, I think the scalar potential is still given by the same formula as the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1/|r - r'(t_r)|, where r' is the position of the charge at tr. Oh, but in this problem, the observation point is r, and the vector d is from where the field was generated (the charge's position at tr) to r. So d = r - r'(tr). Therefore, |d| is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, but in the options, the denominators are given in terms of d multiplied by c and the dot product of d and v. So looking at the options:

Option C: V is qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μo qc v)/(4π (dc -d·v)).

Wait, the denominator is (d c - v·d? Or is it d c - v·d? Or maybe it's (d c - d·v). Hmm.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is: V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|) * [1/(1 + (v·d)/(c² d)))]? Or something along those lines. Or perhaps it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/ (d - (v/c) t Retarded)).

Wait maybe it's better to think about the retarded potential expressions. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| - (v/c) t_retarded ) ]? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀/(4π)) times the integral of the current density over space. But for a point charge, the current is J = q v δ(...). Wait, but I think the vector potential can be written as A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × something) / (something squared).

Wait, but perhaps the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity v of the charge at the retarded time. So for a stationary charge, V would be q/(4πε₀ r), and A would be zero. When the charge is moving, the scalar potential might change because of the motion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, the potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

And the vector potential A(r, t) would be [μ₀ q/(4π)] * [ (v × d) / ( |d| ( |d| c² - v·d ) ) ].

Hmm, that seems complicated. Looking at the options, option C has in the denominator (d c - d·v), but wait, that's not the same as |d| c² - v·d. Because d is a vector, so d c would be c times the vector d. Hmm, maybe the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally because c has units of m/s, d is meters, so c times d would be meters^2/s, and v·d would be (m/s) * m = m²/s. So their difference is in the same unit, which is fine.

Wait, let me think. The denominator in option C is (d c - d · v). So that's c multiplied by the vector d, minus the dot product of d and v. So the denominator is a vector expression, but the entire denominator would be a vector? No, because in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), but that would be a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking again: Option C says V(r,t) = ( q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ) and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d·v)) but with d being a vector scaled by c, so d c is vector, and d·v is a scalar. So that doesn't add. Hmmm, perhaps the denominator in the options is actually written as (d c - (d · v)) but perhaps it's intended to be [c |d| - (d · v)].

Wait, but I'm trying to recall the correct expressions for V and A. Let me think about the Liénard's result for the potentials.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

And the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v × d) / ( |d| ( |d| c² - v·d ) ) ]

Wait, but if I factor that expression, the denominator is |d| ( |d| c² - v·d ) = c² |d|² - (d · v).

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let's compute the denominator in terms of d and v.

Wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - r(tr). The velocity v is at time tr.

Wait, so the denominator for V would involve the term [c² |d| - (d · v)], but in the options, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v). Wait, that can't be, because d is a vector, c is a scalar, so d*c is a vector, and d · v is a scalar. So adding them wouldn't make sense.

So perhaps the options have a typo, but assuming they mean [c |d| - (d · v)], which is a scalar. Let me rewrite option C's denominator as [c |d| - (d · v)].

So option C's V would be (qc)/(4πε₀) * 1/(c |d| - (d·v)/c² * c |d| ? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is [c |d| - (d · v)].

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v), which is a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is to think about the expressions for V and A when we're working in the Lorenz gauge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the general expressions.

The scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r(tr)|)] * [ 1/(1 - (v · (r - r(tr)))/(c² |r - r(tr)|) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ |r - r(tr)| ]^{-1} / [ 1 - (v · d)/(c² |d|) )

Where d = r - r(tr).

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * [ (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / ( |r - r(tr)| ( c² |r - r(tr)| - v · (r - r(tr)) ) ) ]

So, if I let d = r - r(tr), then |d| is the magnitude.

So, the denominator for V is [ |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ] = [ |d| - (v·d)/c² ]

Similarly, the denominator for A is |d| ( c² |d| - v·d )

So, the denominator would be c² |d|² - (v · d)

Hmm, but none of the options seem to present this exactly. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), A = (μo q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v))

Wait, the denominator in V is (d c - d·v). But wait, d is a vector, so d c is a vector. d·v is a scalar. So this is a vector minus a scalar, which isn't possible. So perhaps the options have a typo, and the denominator is [c |d| - (d · v) ].

Wait, but that would make the denominator a scalar. So if that's the case, then let's see:

So for option C, V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d·v)) ), and A is (μo q c v )/(4π (c |d| - (d·v)) )

Comparing this to the expressions I derived earlier:

V = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

V = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² |d| ] / ( c² |d| - (v · d) )

= [ q c² |d| ] / [4πε₀ (c² |d| - (v · d)) ]

Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) as 1/( [c² |d| - (v·d)]/(c² |d|) ) ) = c² |d| / (c² |d| - (v·d)).

So V becomes [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [1/( |d| ) ] * [ c² |d| / (c² |d| - (v·d)) ) ]

Simplify: [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² |d| ] / ( |d| (c² |d| - (v·d)) ) ) → [ q c² ] / (4πε₀ (c² |d| - (v·d)) )

Which would make V = ( q c² ) / [4πε₀ (c² |d| - (v·d)) ]

But looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), but if dc is c multiplied by the vector d, that doesn't fit. Unless dc is actually c |d|. Then option C's V would be ( q c ) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - (d·v)) ].

Which is q/(4πε₀ (|d| - (d·v)/(c)) )

Wait, but that's not the same as our expression. Because our expression is [ q c² ] / [4πε₀ (c² |d| - d·v) ) ].

So unless in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - (d·v)), then the option would have V as (q c)/(4πε₀) * 1/(c |d| - (d·v)).

Which would be V = (q)/(4πε₀) [ c/(c |d| - (d·v) ) ] → V = q/(4πε₀) [ 1/( |d| - (d·v)/(c) ) ]

Hmm, that doesn't match what I have, which is [ c² |d| - (d·v) ] in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the denominator in terms of c squared, so let's factor that:

c² |d| - (d·v) = c² ( |d| ) - (d · v )

Which is a scalar. So the denominator is c² |d| - (d · v).

So V would be (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - d·v) )

But none of the options have this. Let me check the options again.

Option C: V = ( q c ) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ]

Assuming that (d c) is c multiplied by vector d, which I don't think makes sense because you can't multiply a vector by another vector. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the denominator is (d × c), but that's a cross product, which isn't in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × d) / [ (c² |d|² - (d·v)) ) ]

Wait, no, from earlier, the denominator is c² |d|² - (d·v). So the denominator is indeed a scalar.

Wait, but in the options, the denominator for A is (d c - d·v), which in terms of vector operations, that doesn't make sense.

Wait another thought: maybe the denominator in the options is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is a scalar. So option C's denominator is written as (d c - d·v), but perhaps it's a typo and should be (c |d| - d·v).

If that's the case, then option C's V would be:

V = ( q c )/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d·v)) )

And the A would be:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - (d·v)) )

Wait, but let's compare with the expressions I derived.

Earlier, I had V as ( q c² )/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - (d·v)) )

So that's q c² over denominator.

Option C's V is q c over a denominator (c |d| - d·v ), which is the same as (q c )/( c (|d| - (d·v)/(c) )) → same as q/( |d| - (d·v)/(c) )

But my expression is V = ( q c² )/( c² |d| - (d·v) )

Which is [ q c² ] / [ c² (|d|) - (d·v) ]

So if I factor c from denominator, it's c [ c |d| - (d·v)/c ].

Wait, but perhaps c² |d| - (d·v) = c (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

So the denominator in V is c (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

So V can be written as ( q c² ) / [ c (c |d| - (d·v)/c ) ] ) → q c / (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

Which is V = ( q c ) / (c |d| - (d·v)/c )

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps the correct option isn't among them, but that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Alternative approach: The potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'| ) d^3 r'

But for a point charge, ρ is a delta function, so:

V = (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/|r - r(tr)| * [ 1/(1 - (v · (r - r(tr)) )/(c² |r - r(tr)|) ) ]

Which is [ q/(4πε₀) ] * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) )

Which is [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² |d| ] / (c² |d| - v·d )

So V = [ q c² ] / [ 4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) ]

But looking at the options, none of them have c² in the numerator. Let's see each option:

Option A: V is (q)/(4πε₀ r) → but r is |d|, so this is the static potential. It doesn't include any velocity terms, so probably incorrect because the charge is moving, so the potential depends on velocity.

Option B: Same V as A, but A is (v^2 / c²) V. So their A is proportional to v squared. That doesn't sound right because the vector potential should involve the velocity v, not v squared.

Option C: V has q c in numerator, denominator (dc - dv). If dc is c |d|, then denominator is (c |d| - v·d), which would make the V expression (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

Which is different from our derived V, which is (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d ) )

So unless there's a factor of c missing, perhaps option C has V scaled by 1/c.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression. Let me think again. The denominator in V is (c² |d| - v·d ), so V is (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

Which can be written as [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ c² / (c² |d| - v·d ) ]

So the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d ), which is a scalar.

Looking at option C's denominator: (dc - d·v) → if dc is c |d|, then the denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which is the same as (c² |d| - v·d ) divided by c.

So (c |d| - (d·v) ) = ( c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So, option C's denominator is (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So V in option C is:

( q c ) / [ 4 π ε₀ ( (c² |d| - v·d ) / c ) ] → ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Which matches my derived expression for V.

Oh! So if that's the case, then option C has V correct.

Now, checking the vector potential A.

From earlier, A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × d) / [ (c² |d|² - v·d ) ]

But wait, (c² |d|² - v·d ) → because |d| is the magnitude, |d|² is d · d. So denominator is c² (d · d) - (v · d )

Which is a scalar.

Option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (dc - d·v) )

Again, assuming dc is c |d|, denominator is (c |d| - v·d )

Which is (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So A in option C has denominator (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

So A in option C is:

(μ₀ q c v) / [4 π ( (c² |d| - v·d ) / c ) ) ] → (μ₀ q c v ) * c / [4 π (c² |d| - v·d ) ]

= (μ₀ q c² v ) / [4 π (c² |d| - v·d ) ]

But from my earlier expression, the correct A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × d) / (c² |d|² - v·d )

Wait, no. Because in the vector potential, the denominator is c² |d|² - (d · v )

Which is the same as (c² d² - (d · v) )

So, the denominator is (c² d² - (d · v) )

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) )

So, A in option C would have denominator (c |d| - (d · v) ) = [ c² d² - (d · v ) c ] / c.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute A as:

A = (μ₀ q v × d ) / [ (c² |d|² - (d · v )) * (4π) ]

But in option C, A is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - (d · v) ) ]

So, let's compute the denominator in option C:

(c |d| - (d · v) ) → which is (c² |d|² - (d · v) c ) / |d| ?

Wait, not sure. Perhaps there's a mistake in the vector potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c) ) * [ (v × d) / ( ... ) ]

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Let me think about the correct expression for A.

In the standard treatment, the vector potential due to a moving point charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / [ (c² |r - r(tr)|² - (v · (r - r(tr)) ) c² ) ]

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, I think it's:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * ( r - r(tr) ) / |r - r(tr)| × [ 1/(1 - (v · (r - r(tr)) )/(c² |r - r(tr)| ) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the potentials:

The vector potential for a moving charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * [ v × (r - r(tr)) ] / [ (r - r(tr)) · (r - r(tr)) - (v · (r - r(tr)) ) t_r ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the given options.

Looking at option C, the vector potential is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (dc - d·v) )

Assuming dc is c |d|, so denominator is (c |d| - d·v )

Then, A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - d·v ) )

But from the correct expression, I think the vector potential should have a factor of (v × d) in the numerator and (c² |d|² - (d·v )) in the denominator.

Wait, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answers are option C, because V matches correctly when considering the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the A expression. Let me think about the relation between vector potential and magnetic field.

The magnetic field B is given by the curl of A. For a moving charge, B is (μ₀ q)/(4π) [ (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / ( [r - r(tr)]² (1 + (v·r)/(c² |r|) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Liénard's formula for the fields. The electric and magnetic fields are given by:

E = (1/(4πε₀)) [ (q (1 - β² · ) ) / (γ² r²) ) ] ... but this might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Suppose the charge is moving with velocity v. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × r) / (r² - (v·r) t /c² )

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential for a moving charge is given by:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × (r - r(tr)) ) / ( |r - r(tr)| ( |r - r(tr)| c² - v · (r - r(tr)) ) )

Which would make the denominator (c² |d|² - (d · v) )

So, the denominator is (c² |d|² - (d · v) )

So, the vector potential A is:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × d ) / ( c² |d|² - (d · v) )

Which can be written as (μ₀ q )/(4π) (v × d ) / ( |d| (c² |d| - (d · v)/|d| ) )

But wait, (d · v ) is a scalar, and |d| is the magnitude of d, so (d · v ) / |d| is the projection of v onto d.

Hmm, but the denominator in option C is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar.

So to match, perhaps the vector potential in option C is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v) ) )

But that doesn't include the cross product (v × d), as it should in the numerator. So none of the options seem to have the cross product, which suggests that perhaps the question is not considering the cross product, but only the magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming non-relativistic speeds or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's using a simplified version where the vector potential is in the same direction as v.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the structure of the options.

Option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - dv) ), and A as (μo q c v)/(4π (dc - dv) )

So, V and A have the same denominator. So, A is (μo c v ) * V / (4π) (since in option C, V is ( qc/(4πε₀ (denominator) ) ), and A is (μo q c v )/(4π (denominator) ) )

So, A = (μo c v )/(4π) * [ q/(4πε₀ (denominator)) ]^{-1} * V ?

Wait, perhaps not, better to compute the ratio of A to V.

In option C,

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (dc - dv) )

V = ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (dc - dv) )

So A = (μ₀ c v )/(4 π ) * V * (4 π ε₀)/(q c )

Wait, that's messy. Alternatively, A = [ (μ₀ c v )/(4 π) ] * [ 1/(4 π ε₀) ) ]^{-1} * V ?

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of A to V is (μ₀ c v )/( ε₀ )

But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, (c² |d| - (d · v )) ≈ c² |d|, so V becomes (q c²)/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ) → V = q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), which is the static potential. Similarly, A would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π c² |d| ) ) → (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| )

But that's for non-relativistic, but the question doesn't specify that.

But looking back at the options, option B has V as (q)/(4 π ε₀ r ), which is the static case, and A as (v²/c²) V. But the vector potential in reality would involve the velocity v, not v squared.

Hmm, perhaps option B is incorrect because it's using v squared.

Wait, but option C seems to have the correct structure, with both V and A depending on the denominator (dc - dv), which, if interpreted correctly, would align with the derived expressions.

So, after this long thought process, I think the correct option is C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded potential formalism. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) depend on the charge's position \( \vec{r}(t_r) \) and velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), as well as the vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}(t_r) \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \): This is the static scalar potential, valid for a stationary charge. However, the problem involves a moving charge, so this cannot be correct.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): The vector potential involves \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \).  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \): Same issue as Option A; it does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): While this has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \), the scalar potential \( V \) is still static, making this option invalid.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This matches the derived expression for the scalar potential when interpreted with \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) as the dot product and \( d c \) as \( c |\vec{d}| \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This aligns with the expected form of the vector potential, where the numerator involves \( \vec{v} \) and the denominator is the same as in \( V \).  
   **Conclusion**: Correct.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the derived expression, which involves \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): Similarly incorrect due to the wrong sign in the denominator.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Option C correctly captures both the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge, consistent with the retarded potential formalism. 

ANSWER: C
