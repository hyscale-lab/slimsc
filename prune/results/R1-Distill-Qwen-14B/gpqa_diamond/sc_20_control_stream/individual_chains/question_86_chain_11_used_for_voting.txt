Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with different reducing agents. The products in both cases are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but wait, actually, looking again, each reaction produces one of them. Oh wait, no, the products are both (R) and (S) configurations, but the problem says each reaction used a different reducing agent.

Wait, the reactions are:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So, the same product but different configurations, based on different starting materials A and B, which are treated with different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3.

I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically used in more selective reductions, like for esters or ketones, whereas LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce more things, like esters, amides, etc. Oh wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Wait, BH3 is often used in the hydroboration reaction, which is an anti-Markovnikov addition. But when it's used in the presence of a proton source, like in BH3 followed by H+, it might be doing something else. Alternatively, LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for ketones, esters, etc.

Wait, but in this problem, the products are tetrahydro-pyran-2-one derivatives. So maybe these are the result of a reduction of some cyclic ketone or ester? Or perhaps from an ester being reduced to a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H indicates the position of the double bond. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the ring with an oxygen, and a ketone at position 2. And the substituents are at position 4, which is ethyl.

Wait, so the structure looks like a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then cyclizes into a pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol. But wait, LiBH4 would reduce esters to alcohols, but how does that form a pyranone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, but that doesn't seem to fit. Or perhaps it's a ketone that's being reduced, but then why would the product have the ring?

Wait, another approach: the reaction could be a reduction of a cyclic ketone ester. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize into a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has five carbons and an oxygen. The 2H indicates that the double bond is between C2 and C3 (in numbering). But wait, the product is a dihydro structure? Or maybe it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone), which when reduced with LiBH4 or BH3 would open up. Wait, but how would that form a pyranone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a bicyclic compound, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one. So when we have different reducing agents, the reaction conditions might lead to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, the products have different configurations: R and S. So, the starting materials must have different configurations that, upon reduction, lead to different stereocenters in the product.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B, which are treated with different reducing agents. So A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, and B with BH3 and H+.

Wait, the product for A is R configuration, and for B, it's S. So the configuration of the starting material, along with the reducing agent, determines the configuration of the product.

I think that the starting materials are epoxides. Because when you reduce an epoxide, you can get diols, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent... Wait, no, maybe it's a reduction of an ester group.

Wait, another thought: the product is a pyranone, which has a six-membered ring with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone), which upon reduction forms a diol. Then, when the diol is treated under acidic conditions, it can cyclize into a cyclic hemiacetal, which would form the pyranone.

Wait, but how does the reduction lead to the formation of the diol? Let's think about the structure of the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered, with the ketone at C2 and an ethyl group at C4.

Assuming that the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), like a six-membered ring with an ester group. When you reduce the ester with a hydride agent, you would get a diol. But wait, LiBH4 is usually not a good reducing agent for esters, unless under specific conditions. Or is it? Wait, no—LiBH4 can reduce esters under certain conditions, perhaps in the presence of a Lewis acid like ZnCl2.

Wait, but if the starting material is a cyclic ester, reduction would break the ester into a diol. For example, a five-membered cyclic ester (gamma-butyrolactone) would upon reduction become a diol (like 1,4-butanediol). But in this case, the product is a six-membered ring, so the starting material would be a six-membered lactone.

Wait, but let's say the starting material is a 6-membered lactone. Reduction would break the ester into a diol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol could form a cyclic hemiacetal, which would form the pyranone.

Wait, but how would the diol form a pyranone? A diol has two adjacent alcohol groups. If the diol is 1,4-diol, then under acid, it can form a five-membered ring (like in the case of 1,4-butanediol forming a cyclic hemiacetal). But wait, in this case, the product is a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, like a cyclohexanone. But then, upon reduction with LiBH4, it would become cyclohexanol, but that doesn't form a pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a lactone but a cyclic ketone with an additional substituent that allows for cyclization upon reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an adjacent ester group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone substituent. For example, a gamma-keto ester in a cyclic structure. When you reduce such a compound, the ester group is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone may remain, but I'm not sure how that would form the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester in a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, which upon reduction would form the diol, which then would cyclize to form the pyranone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. When reduced, the ether is opened to form a diol, which can then form the pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. For example, a cyclic ester with a ketone group, so that upon reduction of the ester to an alcohol, and perhaps the ketone is also reduced, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The product has a chiral center, at C4 perhaps? The configuration is R or S depending on which starting material was used and the reducing agent.

So if the starting material has a chiral center, and the reduction leads to retention or inversion of configuration, that would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, but how does the reducing agent affect the configuration? Let's think about the type of reduction.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that would typically reduce esters to alcohols in a way that follows certain stereochemistry if there's a chiral center involved.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic structure, so the reduction must form a new chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo reduction to form diols, which can then cyclize. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone group. For example, something like:

O
||
C-O-C-(CH2)n

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a five-membered ring with an ester and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, would form a diol with a stereocenter.

Wait, let's think about the product. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, with the ketone at position 2. The substituents are ethyl at position 4.

Now, the formation of the pyranone would likely result from the cyclization of a diol. So, if the starting material is a diol, then under certain conditions (like acid), it would form the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but how does the diol come from the starting material? Maybe the starting material is a ketone ester, and the reduction breaks the ester into a diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone which upon reduction forms a diol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters. So, let's say the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, like CH2(COOR)COOR. When you reduce that, the ester groups are reduced to CH2(OH) groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ester. Wait, but then reduction might open the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that allows for the formation of a diol upon reduction, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester with an adjacent substituent that allows for the formation of a diol with a stereocenter when reduced.

Wait, another angle: the product is (R) or (S) configuration. So the starting material must have a stereogenic center that, upon reduction, converts to the corresponding configuration in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 to form diols. The reduction would involve the ester group:

RCO-O-R' → RCH2-OH + R'OH (in diol formation).

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-CO-O-R'. Upon reduction, the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, and the ester would be reduced as well.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the structures. Gamma-keto esters have the ester group and a ketone two carbons away. So, for example, CH2(COOR)COOR.

So when you reduce a gamma-keto ester with LiBH4, the ester group is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced to an alcohol. But wait, LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols, but in the presence of a ketone, maybe the stereoselectivity would be different.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic structure. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester in a cyclic structure, such as a six-membered ring with ester and ketone groups.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a cyclic gamma-keto ester, like the lactone form, then upon reduction, it would break open to form a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but how would the diol form the cyclic pyranone? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a substituted cyclic ketone, and the reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options given.

The options are about the starting materials A and B. The options are different configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful.

So the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with substituents. The structures are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with R or S configurations.

Wait, so the structure would be:

Pentanoic acid, meaning a five-carbon chain ending with a carboxylic acid group. At position 3, there's an ethyl group. At position 5 (the same carbon as the carboxylic acid?), there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, wait, position 5 in a five-carbon chain would be the last carbon. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(C2H5)-CO-O-isobutyl ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the formula would be something like CH2CH2-CO-O-something. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it mentally.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's not right. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. But with substituents.

So, position 3 is the third carbon from the COOH group. So COOH is position 1. Then positions 2,3,4,5.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me renumber:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2-
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 4: CH2-
Position 5: CO ?

Wait, no, wait. For pentanoic acid, the chain is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but in this compound, substituents are at position 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-C(ethyl)(isobutoxy)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-CH(CH2CH3)2
|
CH(CH2CH3)
|
CH2
|
COOH

But I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the key is that the starting material has a ketone group and an ester group (since isobutoxy is an ether group). So, the structure has both a ketone and an ester (since isobutoxy is O-R, but that's an ether, not an ester). Wait, maybe it's an ester somewhere else.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Ah, so the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Let me think: the compound is pentanoic acid, so the chain is five carbons, with the COOH at one end.

At position 3 (third carbon from COOH), there's an ethyl group.

At position 5 (the last carbon), there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone group (oxo).

Wait, that can't be right because position 5 would be the last carbon, so the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, but that's four carbons from COOH. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R, where R is isobutyl (CH2CH(CH2CH3)2).

Wait, but that would place the substituents on the fourth carbon. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

But regardless, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an ether group and a ketone. So when this is reduced, it would form an alcohol.

Wait, so let's think about the reaction. When the starting material (A or B) is treated with a reducing agent (LiBH4 or BH3), the ketone group (oxo) would be reduced to an alcohol. The ester group (if any) would also be reduced to an alcohol. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an acid, so perhaps it's an ester?

Wait, no, the starting material is a pentanoic acid, so the end is COOH. Unless it's an ester of the acid. Wait, but the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the -5-oxo is a ketone on the same carbon as the isobutoxy group.

So, the structure would be something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make it a six-membered compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the fifth carbon is the one with the ketone and the isobutoxy group.

Hmm, but then how does the reduction work?

Wait, when you reduce a ketone with a hydride agent like LiBH4 or BH3, you get a secondary alcohol. So the ketone (C=O) becomes CH(OH)-.

So in the starting material, which is a pentanoic acid with a ketone and an ether, after reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol. But wait, the starting material is an acid. So if you reduce the ketone, you get an alcohol, and the acid remains.

Wait, but then the product would be an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. How does that form the pyranone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester. Let me think again.

Wait, the product is a six-membered ring (tetrahydro-pyran), so perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester in a five-membered ring, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, I think I'm going around in circles. Let me try a different approach.

The key point is that the starting materials A and B, when treated with different reducing agents, produce enantiomers of the same product. So, the configuration of the starting material must lead to opposite configurations in the product based on the reducing agent.

Wait, the products are (R) and (S) configurations. So, the starting materials must have the opposite configurations to produce enantiomeric products.

Wait, but looking at the options, the starting materials can be either R or S.

The options are:

Option D) A is R, B is S.

Option C) A is S, B is R.

Wait, but the product from A is R, and from B is S.

So, if the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, and the reducing agent affects the way the configuration is set, then perhaps the starting material with R configuration leads to R product, and S leads to S.

But wait, the reducing agents are different: LiBH4 and BH3. So perhaps the stereochemistry of the product depends on the reducing agent used.

Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are anti-Markovnikov and have some stereoselectivity.

Wait, but in the case of reducing a ketone, both LiBH4 and BH3 would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So perhaps the difference lies in how the stereochemistry is controlled.

Wait, LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent and may approach the ketone from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction forms a diol with a specific configuration, which then cyclizes into the pyranone with the correct stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide with a hydride agent, you can form vicinal diols. The configuration of the diol depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but how would that form a pyranone? Maybe the diol then forms an acetal or hemiacetal under acidic conditions, leading to the cyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The options for starting materials A and B are either both R, both S, or one R and the other S.

The products are R and S, respectively.

So, when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3 and H+, it gives S.

So, the starting materials A and B must be enantiomers. Because the same starting material, when treated with a different reducing agent, gives opposite configurations.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. The configurations would depend on both the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's effect.

But if the reducing agent inverts the configuration or not, that could determine the product.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reduction, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is a planar sp2 hybridized carbon. So, the attack can occur from either side, leading to possible racemization unless the starting material is chiral and the reaction proceeds with some stereoselectivity.

Wait, but if the starting material is a chiral ketone, the reduction may proceed with a certain facial selectivity, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent that makes it approach the hydride from a certain face, leading to R or S configuration.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the product structure again.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has the ketone at C2 and an ethyl group at C4.

So, the ring is:

O
||
C2
|
C3
|
C4 (with ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6 (connected back to O)

Wait, perhaps the product is formed from a diol that cyclizes. So, if the diol is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-pentanoic acid or something similar, then under acidic conditions, it would form a cyclic hemiacetal, leading to the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 gives a diol with a certain configuration, which upon cyclization forms the pyranone.

So, let's say the starting material is a gamma-keto ester: RCO-CO-O-R'.

Upon reduction, the ester group (CO-O-R') is reduced to CH2-OH, and the ketone (RCO-) is reduced to RCH2-OH. So, the reduction would yield a diol: RCH2-OH-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but then upon cyclization, that diol would form a five-membered ring, not a six.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a five-membered cyclic gamma-keto ester. Upon reduction, it would break to form a diol, which then forms a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are about the configuration of the starting material. So, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that affects the configuration of the product.

When A is treated with LiBH4, the product is R. When B is treated with BH3, the product is S.

So, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa.

Alternatively, the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, and the reducing agent doesn't change it.

Wait, but the product's configuration depends on the starting material and the reducing agent. Thus, the same starting material treated with different reducing agents might yield different configurations.

But in this problem, A and B are different starting materials. So, their configurations must be different, leading to R and S products respectively.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So, if A is R, then it gives R product with LiBH4, and B (S) gives S product with BH3.

But looking at the options, option D says A is R, B is S.

Wait, but let's think about how the reduction could lead to the product's configuration.

Suppose the starting material is a ketone with a certain configuration. The hydride attack could be from a specific face, leading to R or S configuration in the product.

If the starting material is R, and the hydride attacks from the same face, the product's configuration could be R or S, depending on the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material doesn't directly influence the product's configuration because the hydride attack is not stereoselective in a way that depends on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, another approach: the configuration of the product is determined by the approach of the hydride. For example, if the starting material is a planar carbonyl, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the starting material is chiral, perhaps the environment affects the approach, leading to some preference.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl. When reduced, the hydride approaches the carbonyl from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration in the diol.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with a ketone and an ether. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the approach of the hydride, leading to the product's configuration.

If the starting material is R, then the hydride attacks from a certain face, leading to R product when using LiBH4, and if the starting material is S, the approach is different, leading to S product when using BH3.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may cause more hydride attack from a specific side. For example, if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would lead to R product, and BH3, being less strong, might lead to S, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the starting material with LiBH4 and BH3 leads to different diastereomers. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to look for similar problems. I remember that when using different reducing agents like LiAlH4 and NaBH4, the product's configuration can vary due to the strength of the reducing agent. Alternatively, in some reductions, the hydride approach can be influenced by steric factors.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent substituent that controls the approach of the hydride. For example, in a cyclic ketone, the hydride can attack from the top or bottom face, leading to different configurations.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The possible options are A, B, C, D. They all involve the same substituents but different configurations.

The products are R and S, so the starting materials must be enantiomers, because the same product can be obtained with opposite configurations from opposite starting materials.

Wait, but the products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must be enantiomers as well. Because when you reduce enantiomeric starting materials with different reducing agents, you can get enantiomeric products.

So, looking at the options, D says A is R and B is S.

So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. B (S) treated with BH3 gives S product.

Thus, the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the proper starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to analyze how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the configuration of the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - Reaction 1: Starting material A + LiBH4 + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - Reaction 2: Starting material B + BH3 + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

2. **Product Formation**:
   - The products are enantiomers, differing in configuration (R and S). This suggests that the starting materials must also be enantiomers, as the stereochemistry of the starting material directly influences the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Role of Reducing Agents**:
   - LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. While LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, the stereochemical outcome of the reduction depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the hydride during the reduction.

4. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives, differing in configuration (R or S). The configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product when reduced.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would not produce enantiomeric products, as identical starting materials would yield identical products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. Similar to Option A, this would not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would produce enantiomeric products, but the configurations of the products would not match the given (R) and (S) outcomes.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This matches the requirement, as the (R)-configured starting material with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product, and the (S)-configured starting material with BH3 produces the (S)-product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are enantiomers, with A being (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B being (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This ensures that the products are enantiomers with the correct configurations.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with different reducing agents. The products in both cases are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but wait, actually, looking again, each reaction produces one of them. Oh wait, no, the products are both (R) and (S) configurations, but the problem says each reaction used a different reducing agent.

Wait, the reactions are:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So, the same product but different configurations, based on different starting materials A and B, which are treated with different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3.

I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically used in more selective reductions, like for esters or ketones, whereas LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce more things, like esters, amides, etc. Oh wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Wait, BH3 is often used in the hydroboration reaction, which is an anti-Markovnikov addition. But when it's used in the presence of a proton source, like in BH3 followed by H+, it might be doing something else. Alternatively, LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for ketones, esters, etc.

Wait, but in this problem, the products are tetrahydro-pyran-2-one derivatives. So maybe these are the result of a reduction of some cyclic ketone or ester? Or perhaps from an ester being reduced to a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H indicates the position of the double bond. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the ring with an oxygen, and a ketone at position 2. And the substituents are at position 4, which is ethyl.

Wait, so the structure looks like a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then cyclizes into a pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol. But wait, LiBH4 would reduce esters to alcohols, but how does that form a pyranone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, but that doesn't seem to fit. Or perhaps it's a ketone that's being reduced, but then why would the product have the ring?

Wait, another approach: the reaction could be a reduction of a cyclic ketone ester. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize into a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has five carbons and an oxygen. The 2H indicates that the double bond is between C2 and C3 (in numbering). But wait, the product is a dihydro structure? Or maybe it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone), which when reduced with LiBH4 or BH3 would open up. Wait, but how would that form a pyranone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a bicyclic compound, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one. So when we have different reducing agents, the reaction conditions might lead to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, the products have different configurations: R and S. So, the starting materials must have different configurations that, upon reduction, lead to different stereocenters in the product.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B, which are treated with different reducing agents. So A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, and B with BH3 and H+.

Wait, the product for A is R configuration, and for B, it's S. So the configuration of the starting material, along with the reducing agent, determines the configuration of the product.

I think that the starting materials are epoxides. Because when you reduce an epoxide, you can get diols, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent... Wait, no, maybe it's a reduction of an ester group.

Wait, another thought: the product is a pyranone, which has a six-membered ring with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone), which upon reduction forms a diol. Then, when the diol is treated under acidic conditions, it can cyclize into a cyclic hemiacetal, which would form the pyranone.

Wait, but how does the reduction lead to the formation of the diol? Let's think about the structure of the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered, with the ketone at C2 and an ethyl group at C4.

Assuming that the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), like a six-membered ring with an ester group. When you reduce the ester with a hydride agent, you would get a diol. But wait, LiBH4 is usually not a good reducing agent for esters, unless under specific conditions. Or is it? Wait, no—LiBH4 can reduce esters under certain conditions, perhaps in the presence of a Lewis acid like ZnCl2.

Wait, but if the starting material is a cyclic ester, reduction would break the ester into a diol. For example, a five-membered cyclic ester (gamma-butyrolactone) would upon reduction become a diol (like 1,4-butanediol). But in this case, the product is a six-membered ring, so the starting material would be a six-membered lactone.

Wait, but let's say the starting material is a 6-membered lactone. Reduction would break the ester into a diol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol could form a cyclic hemiacetal, which would form the pyranone.

Wait, but how would the diol form a pyranone? A diol has two adjacent alcohol groups. If the diol is 1,4-diol, then under acid, it can form a five-membered ring (like in the case of 1,4-butanediol forming a cyclic hemiacetal). But wait, in this case, the product is a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, like a cyclohexanone. But then, upon reduction with LiBH4, it would become cyclohexanol, but that doesn't form a pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a lactone but a cyclic ketone with an additional substituent that allows for cyclization upon reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an adjacent ester group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone substituent. For example, a gamma-keto ester in a cyclic structure. When you reduce such a compound, the ester group is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone may remain, but I'm not sure how that would form the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester in a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, which upon reduction would form the diol, which then would cyclize to form the pyranone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. When reduced, the ether is opened to form a diol, which can then form the pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. For example, a cyclic ester with a ketone group, so that upon reduction of the ester to an alcohol, and perhaps the ketone is also reduced, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The product has a chiral center, at C4 perhaps? The configuration is R or S depending on which starting material was used and the reducing agent.

So if the starting material has a chiral center, and the reduction leads to retention or inversion of configuration, that would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, but how does the reducing agent affect the configuration? Let's think about the type of reduction.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that would typically reduce esters to alcohols in a way that follows certain stereochemistry if there's a chiral center involved.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic structure, so the reduction must form a new chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo reduction to form diols, which can then cyclize. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone group. For example, something like:

O
||
C-O-C-(CH2)n

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a five-membered ring with an ester and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, would form a diol with a stereocenter.

Wait, let's think about the product. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, with the ketone at position 2. The substituents are ethyl at position 4.

Now, the formation of the pyranone would likely result from the cyclization of a diol. So, if the starting material is a diol, then under certain conditions (like acid), it would form the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but how does the diol come from the starting material? Maybe the starting material is a ketone ester, and the reduction breaks the ester into a diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone which upon reduction forms a diol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters. So, let's say the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, like CH2(COOR)COOR. When you reduce that, the ester groups are reduced to CH2(OH) groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ester. Wait, but then reduction might open the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that allows for the formation of a diol upon reduction, which then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester with an adjacent substituent that allows for the formation of a diol with a stereocenter when reduced.

Wait, another angle: the product is (R) or (S) configuration. So the starting material must have a stereogenic center that, upon reduction, converts to the corresponding configuration in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 to form diols. The reduction would involve the ester group:

RCO-O-R' → RCH2-OH + R'OH (in diol formation).

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-CO-O-R'. Upon reduction, the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, and the ester would be reduced as well.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the structures. Gamma-keto esters have the ester group and a ketone two carbons away. So, for example, CH2(COOR)COOR.

So when you reduce a gamma-keto ester with LiBH4, the ester group is reduced to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced to an alcohol. But wait, LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols, but in the presence of a ketone, maybe the stereoselectivity would be different.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic structure. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester in a cyclic structure, such as a six-membered ring with ester and ketone groups.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a cyclic gamma-keto ester, like the lactone form, then upon reduction, it would break open to form a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but how would the diol form the cyclic pyranone? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a substituted cyclic ketone, and the reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options given.

The options are about the starting materials A and B. The options are different configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful.

So the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with substituents. The structures are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with R or S configurations.

Wait, so the structure would be:

Pentanoic acid, meaning a five-carbon chain ending with a carboxylic acid group. At position 3, there's an ethyl group. At position 5 (the same carbon as the carboxylic acid?), there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, wait, position 5 in a five-carbon chain would be the last carbon. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(C2H5)-CO-O-isobutyl ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the formula would be something like CH2CH2-CO-O-something. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it mentally.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's not right. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. But with substituents.

So, position 3 is the third carbon from the COOH group. So COOH is position 1. Then positions 2,3,4,5.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me renumber:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2-
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 4: CH2-
Position 5: CO ?

Wait, no, wait. For pentanoic acid, the chain is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but in this compound, substituents are at position 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-C(ethyl)(isobutoxy)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-CH(CH2CH3)2
|
CH(CH2CH3)
|
CH2
|
COOH

But I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the key is that the starting material has a ketone group and an ester group (since isobutoxy is an ether group). So, the structure has both a ketone and an ester (since isobutoxy is O-R, but that's an ether, not an ester). Wait, maybe it's an ester somewhere else.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Ah, so the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Let me think: the compound is pentanoic acid, so the chain is five carbons, with the COOH at one end.

At position 3 (third carbon from COOH), there's an ethyl group.

At position 5 (the last carbon), there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone group (oxo).

Wait, that can't be right because position 5 would be the last carbon, so the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, but that's four carbons from COOH. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R, where R is isobutyl (CH2CH(CH2CH3)2).

Wait, but that would place the substituents on the fourth carbon. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

But regardless, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an ether group and a ketone. So when this is reduced, it would form an alcohol.

Wait, so let's think about the reaction. When the starting material (A or B) is treated with a reducing agent (LiBH4 or BH3), the ketone group (oxo) would be reduced to an alcohol. The ester group (if any) would also be reduced to an alcohol. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an acid, so perhaps it's an ester?

Wait, no, the starting material is a pentanoic acid, so the end is COOH. Unless it's an ester of the acid. Wait, but the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the -5-oxo is a ketone on the same carbon as the isobutoxy group.

So, the structure would be something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make it a six-membered compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the fifth carbon is the one with the ketone and the isobutoxy group.

Hmm, but then how does the reduction work?

Wait, when you reduce a ketone with a hydride agent like LiBH4 or BH3, you get a secondary alcohol. So the ketone (C=O) becomes CH(OH)-.

So in the starting material, which is a pentanoic acid with a ketone and an ether, after reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol. But wait, the starting material is an acid. So if you reduce the ketone, you get an alcohol, and the acid remains.

Wait, but then the product would be an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. How does that form the pyranone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester. Let me think again.

Wait, the product is a six-membered ring (tetrahydro-pyran), so perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester in a five-membered ring, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, I think I'm going around in circles. Let me try a different approach.

The key point is that the starting materials A and B, when treated with different reducing agents, produce enantiomers of the same product. So, the configuration of the starting material must lead to opposite configurations in the product based on the reducing agent.

Wait, the products are (R) and (S) configurations. So, the starting materials must have the opposite configurations to produce enantiomeric products.

Wait, but looking at the options, the starting materials can be either R or S.

The options are:

Option D) A is R, B is S.

Option C) A is S, B is R.

Wait, but the product from A is R, and from B is S.

So, if the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, and the reducing agent affects the way the configuration is set, then perhaps the starting material with R configuration leads to R product, and S leads to S.

But wait, the reducing agents are different: LiBH4 and BH3. So perhaps the stereochemistry of the product depends on the reducing agent used.

Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are anti-Markovnikov and have some stereoselectivity.

Wait, but in the case of reducing a ketone, both LiBH4 and BH3 would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So perhaps the difference lies in how the stereochemistry is controlled.

Wait, LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent and may approach the ketone from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction forms a diol with a specific configuration, which then cyclizes into the pyranone with the correct stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide with a hydride agent, you can form vicinal diols. The configuration of the diol depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but how would that form a pyranone? Maybe the diol then forms an acetal or hemiacetal under acidic conditions, leading to the cyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The options for starting materials A and B are either both R, both S, or one R and the other S.

The products are R and S, respectively.

So, when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3 and H+, it gives S.

So, the starting materials A and B must be enantiomers. Because the same starting material, when treated with a different reducing agent, gives opposite configurations.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. The configurations would depend on both the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's effect.

But if the reducing agent inverts the configuration or not, that could determine the product.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reduction, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is a planar sp2 hybridized carbon. So, the attack can occur from either side, leading to possible racemization unless the starting material is chiral and the reaction proceeds with some stereoselectivity.

Wait, but if the starting material is a chiral ketone, the reduction may proceed with a certain facial selectivity, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent that makes it approach the hydride from a certain face, leading to R or S configuration.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the product structure again.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has the ketone at C2 and an ethyl group at C4.

So, the ring is:

O
||
C2
|
C3
|
C4 (with ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6 (connected back to O)

Wait, perhaps the product is formed from a diol that cyclizes. So, if the diol is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-pentanoic acid or something similar, then under acidic conditions, it would form a cyclic hemiacetal, leading to the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 gives a diol with a certain configuration, which upon cyclization forms the pyranone.

So, let's say the starting material is a gamma-keto ester: RCO-CO-O-R'.

Upon reduction, the ester group (CO-O-R') is reduced to CH2-OH, and the ketone (RCO-) is reduced to RCH2-OH. So, the reduction would yield a diol: RCH2-OH-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but then upon cyclization, that diol would form a five-membered ring, not a six.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a five-membered cyclic gamma-keto ester. Upon reduction, it would break to form a diol, which then forms a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are about the configuration of the starting material. So, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that affects the configuration of the product.

When A is treated with LiBH4, the product is R. When B is treated with BH3, the product is S.

So, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa.

Alternatively, the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, and the reducing agent doesn't change it.

Wait, but the product's configuration depends on the starting material and the reducing agent. Thus, the same starting material treated with different reducing agents might yield different configurations.

But in this problem, A and B are different starting materials. So, their configurations must be different, leading to R and S products respectively.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So, if A is R, then it gives R product with LiBH4, and B (S) gives S product with BH3.

But looking at the options, option D says A is R, B is S.

Wait, but let's think about how the reduction could lead to the product's configuration.

Suppose the starting material is a ketone with a certain configuration. The hydride attack could be from a specific face, leading to R or S configuration in the product.

If the starting material is R, and the hydride attacks from the same face, the product's configuration could be R or S, depending on the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material doesn't directly influence the product's configuration because the hydride attack is not stereoselective in a way that depends on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, another approach: the configuration of the product is determined by the approach of the hydride. For example, if the starting material is a planar carbonyl, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the starting material is chiral, perhaps the environment affects the approach, leading to some preference.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl. When reduced, the hydride approaches the carbonyl from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration in the diol.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with a ketone and an ether. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the approach of the hydride, leading to the product's configuration.

If the starting material is R, then the hydride attacks from a certain face, leading to R product when using LiBH4, and if the starting material is S, the approach is different, leading to S product when using BH3.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may cause more hydride attack from a specific side. For example, if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would lead to R product, and BH3, being less strong, might lead to S, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the starting material with LiBH4 and BH3 leads to different diastereomers. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to look for similar problems. I remember that when using different reducing agents like LiAlH4 and NaBH4, the product's configuration can vary due to the strength of the reducing agent. Alternatively, in some reductions, the hydride approach can be influenced by steric factors.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent substituent that controls the approach of the hydride. For example, in a cyclic ketone, the hydride can attack from the top or bottom face, leading to different configurations.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The possible options are A, B, C, D. They all involve the same substituents but different configurations.

The products are R and S, so the starting materials must be enantiomers, because the same product can be obtained with opposite configurations from opposite starting materials.

Wait, but the products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must be enantiomers as well. Because when you reduce enantiomeric starting materials with different reducing agents, you can get enantiomeric products.

So, looking at the options, D says A is R and B is S.

So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. B (S) treated with BH3 gives S product.

Thus, the correct option is D.


The question involves determining the proper starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to analyze how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the configuration of the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - Reaction 1: Starting material A + LiBH4 + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - Reaction 2: Starting material B + BH3 + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

2. **Product Formation**:
   - The products are enantiomers, differing in configuration (R and S). This suggests that the starting materials must also be enantiomers, as the stereochemistry of the starting material directly influences the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Role of Reducing Agents**:
   - LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. While LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, the stereochemical outcome of the reduction depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the hydride during the reduction.

4. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives, differing in configuration (R or S). The configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product when reduced.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would not produce enantiomeric products, as identical starting materials would yield identical products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. Similar to Option A, this would not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would produce enantiomeric products, but the configurations of the products would not match the given (R) and (S) outcomes.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This matches the requirement, as the (R)-configured starting material with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product, and the (S)-configured starting material with BH3 produces the (S)-product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are enantiomers, with A being (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B being (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This ensures that the products are enantiomers with the correct configurations.

**Answer: D**
