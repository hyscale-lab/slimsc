Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. The spin state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that notation means a two-component vector, like a spinor, right?

So, the problem gives me the spin state as (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin component along the y-axis. I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the spin state.

Wait, but what is S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operator S_y for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Oh, the note in the question gives the sigma_y matrix: it's a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and -i and i on the off-diagonals. So sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So, S_y would be (ħ/2) * sigma_y. That makes sense. So, S_y is a matrix, and to find the expectation value, I have to compute the inner product of the spin state with S_y times the spin state.

Wait, but wait. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Let me write that as a column vector. So the state vector ψ is:

ψ = [3i; 4]

But wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's written, maybe it's (3i, 4) as a row vector. But in quantum mechanics, the kets are column vectors. So I think ψ is a column vector with first component 3i and second component 4. So ψ is:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Now, to compute ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩, I need to first compute S_y |ψ⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|.

Alternatively, the expectation value can be calculated as ψ† S_y ψ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

So let me break it down step by step.

First, compute S_y |ψ⟩. Since S_y is (ħ/2) * sigma_y, let's compute sigma_y multiplied by ψ.

Sigma_y * ψ:

sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So sigma_y times ψ is:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -i *4 = -4i

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i *3i = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So sigma_y ψ = [ -4i ; -3 ]

Then, S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ; -3 ]

So S_y ψ = [ (-4i ħ)/2 ; (-3 ħ)/2 ]

Which simplifies to [ (-2i ħ) ; (-3 ħ/2) ]

Now, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [3i*, 4*]. But 3i is 3i, so 3i* is -3i. And 4 is real, so 4* is 4.

So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ]

Now, ψ† times S_y ψ is the dot product of ψ† and S_y ψ.

So let's compute each component:

First component of ψ†: -3i multiplied by first component of S_y ψ: (-2i ħ)

Second component of ψ†: 4 multiplied by second component of S_y ψ: (-3 ħ/2 )

So the dot product is:

(-3i)(-2i ħ ) + (4)(-3 ħ/2 )

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-2i ħ ) = (6 i² ħ ) = 6*(-1) ħ = -6 ħ

Second term: 4 * (-3 ħ/2 ) = (-12 ħ/2 ) = -6 ħ.

So summing both terms:

-6 ħ + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait, because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, and we computed sigma_y ψ. So the entire calculation becomes:

⟨ ψ | S_y | ψ ⟩ = ( (3i)* , 4* ) ( (ħ/2) sigma_y ) [3i;4 ]

So perhaps I should factor out the ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me double-check.

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So when I compute S_y |ψ⟩, it's (ħ/2) sigma_y |ψ⟩, which is (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y |ψ⟩ result.

Wait, in the earlier step, I had:

sigma_y |ψ⟩ = [ -4i; -3 ]

So S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

So when I compute the dot product ψ† S_y |ψ⟩, it's ψ† multiplied by (ħ/2)(sigma_y |ψ⟩).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value directly without separating the ħ/2.

So let's re-calculate considering that S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So the expectation value is ( (3i)*  , 4* ) * ( (ħ/2) sigma_y ) * [3i;4 ].

Which is (ħ/2) times [ (3i)* , 4* ] sigma_y [3i;4 ].

Compute the inner product part first: [ (3i)* , 4* ] sigma_y [3i;4 ]

Let me compute [3i, 4] (because (3i)* is -3i, but wait, no: (3i)* is 3i*? Wait, 3i is a complex number. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, because (a+bi)* = a -bi. So 3i → 0 -3i, so (3i)* is -3i.

So [ (3i)* , 4* ] is [ -3i, 4 ]

So the matrix multiplication is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by sigma_y multiplied by [3i;4 ].

Wait, but sigma_y is a 2x2 matrix. Let me structure the computation correctly.

The calculation is [a, b] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [c; d].

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute with the vectors.

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by the result of sigma_y * [3i;4 ].

Earlier, sigma_y * [3i;4] = [ -4i; -3 ]

So [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ] = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3 )

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12 (-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the inner product without the (ħ/2) factor is -24.

So expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the possible answers are fractions with 25 in the denominator. Hmm, that's odd. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second. Let's go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication of [ -3i, 4 ] and sigma_y [3i;4 ].

Wait, let me recompute sigma_y * [3i;4 ].

sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So first component of sigma_y * [3i;4 ] is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component is i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So sigma_y * [3i;4] is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ] = (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Compute (-3i)*(-4i) = (12 i²) = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the inner product is -24. Then, expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but this gives -12 ħ. Looking back at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25, which is much smaller. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the state vector is not normalized. Because, in expectation values, the state should be normalized, meaning ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1. Let me check.

Compute ⟨ψ|ψ⟩: (3i,4) multiplied by (3i,4)†.

Wait, wait, the state vector is [3i;4], so its conjugate transpose is [ -3i, 4 ].

So inner product is ( -3i * 3i ) + (4 *4 )

Compute each term:

-3i *3i = (-9 i² )= (-9)(-1) =9.

4*4 =16.

Sum: 9+16=25.

So the norm is 25. So the state is not normalized. So to compute the expectation value correctly, perhaps I should normalize the state.

Wait, the expectation value is ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ | ψ⟩, because expectation values are calculated as ⟨ψ | O | ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩ if the state isn't normalized.

Ah! I think that's where I went wrong. Because earlier, I didn't normalize the state.

So the correct expectation value would be [ ( -24 ) * ( ħ/2 ) ] divided by 25.

Wait, let me clarify.

Because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the expectation value without normalization is ( (ħ/2 ) * (-24) ) = -12 ħ.

But the state isn't normalized (its norm squared is 25), so the expectation is (-12 ħ) /25.

So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

Wait, let me verify.

So the steps are:

1. Compute sigma_y |ψ⟩ = [ -4i; -3 ]

2. Compute ⟨ψ | sigma_y |ψ⟩: [ -3i, 4 ] [ -4i; -3 ] = (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) = (12 i²) + (-12) = (-12) + (-12) = -24.

3. So the expectation value of sigma_y is (-24)/25, because the state has norm squared 25.

4. Then, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2 ) * ( (-24)/25 ) = (-12 ħ)/25.

So the correct answer is option A: -12 ħ/25.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator \( S_y \) for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle is given by:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad \text{where } \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Compute \( \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)**:
   \[
   \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)**:
   The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \langle \psi | = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Taking the inner product:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute each term:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12, \quad 4(-3) = -12.
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

4. **Normalize the State**:
   The norm of \( \psi \) is:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Since the state is not normalized, divide by \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of \( S_y \)**:
   Using \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_y \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]
