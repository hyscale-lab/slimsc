Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of these seven compounds exhibit optical activity. Let me think about each one step by step.

First, I remember that optical activity means the compound has chirality. Chirality arises when a molecule has a stereocenter or a plane of asymmetry. So, if a molecule has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry, it can be optically active.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, so this is an alkene with substituents. The (Z) configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond. But do alkenes with E/Z isomerism have chirality? I don't think so because the double bond itself isn't a chiral center. Unless there's a stereogenic center elsewhere. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 has a methyl group and two CH2 groups maybe. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so with substitution. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So the molecule is Cl–C(=CH2–CH2CH3)–CH(CH3)? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 but that's a single bond. Wait, no, but it's but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 with substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond where? Oh, no, wait. The correct structure for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2–CH3? Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. For that, a carbon needs four different substituents. Let's see the structure again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and the double bond. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So C2 would be CH(CH3) attached to a double bond. So the substituents around C2 would be: CH3, CH2CH3, and two double bonds? Wait, no. In but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with substituents, 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on the second. So it's Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2–CH3? Wait, no, but that would make the molecule Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl–C(=CH(CH2CH3))–CH3? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check for stereocenters. If any carbon in the molecule has four different groups attached, it's a chiral center. Let's see: the molecule is (Z) configuration, but does that imply any stereogenic centers? The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups, perhaps. Wait, but C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2, which has a methyl and another CH2. Wait, perhaps C2 has a methyl, a H, and the double bond. So maybe the substituents around C2 are: CH3, H, and two CH2 groups. Wait, that doesn't make four different groups. So C2 wouldn't be a chiral center. So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? If not, then it's not optically active. So I think this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. So no for this one.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the molecule is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't sound right. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the answer is that it doesn't have a chiral center, so doesn't show optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   This is a more complex structure. Hexahydro suggests a six-membered ring, and methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione implies a fused ring system. The substituents are chloromethylene, which is a CH2Cl group attached with a double bond maybe? The (E) configuration suggests it's a double bond geometry. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Well, the R and S in the name indicate stereocenters. So 3aR and 7aS are stereocenters, so the molecule has them. Therefore, it has chirality, so it's optically active. So yes for this one.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In this case, the 2 and 3 positions are substituted with methyl groups. So the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. Let's check for C2: substituents are methyl, another CH(CH3) group, two carboxylic acid groups? Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. If it's 2 and 3 substituted, then each of those CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of the two central carbons has: a methyl, a CH(CH3), and two oxygen-containing groups. Let me see: C2 has a methyl, a CH(CH3), an OOC- group from the left, and another CH(CH3) from the right. So, substituents are: methyl, CH(CH3), OOC-CH2-CH2- (wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong). Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C3 has: on C2, a methyl, a CH(CH3), a carboxylic acid group (OOC-), and another substituent. Wait, maybe it's better to just imagine the structure.

Wait, the structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the central carbons (the two CH(CH3)) would have what substituents? Let's take C2: attached to two CH(CH3) groups, a methyl, and the rest? Wait, no. Each of these carbons would have:

- C2: connected to C1 (which is the OOC- group), C3 (another CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, what's the fourth substituent on C2? Oh, wait, no. Each of the two central carbons is CH(CH3), so each has two CH groups attached. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let's try to count the substituents on C2. If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- C2: attached to a COOH group (from C1), a CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, wait. No, because if it's 2 and 3 positions, each is CH(CH3). So each has:

- For C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), methyl, and another substituent. Wait, but that's four substituents. Let's enumerate them:

On C2 (the second carbon):

- One substituent is the carboxylic acid group from C1: OOC-.

- The other substituents are: CH(CH3) (attached to C3, which is the next carbon), a methyl group (from 2-methyl), and two others? Wait, no, each central carbon is CH(CH3), so each has two CH(CH3) groups, a methyl, and another group. Wait, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two middle carbons is CH(CH3), so each has a methyl and three other substituents. Wait, but each CH(CH3) would have two CH groups. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has four substituents: two CH(CH3) groups (on either side), a methyl, and another substituent. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has four different groups attached. Let's see for C2:

- Group 1: The carboxylic acid group (from C1: -COOH).

- Group 2: The CH(CH3) group (from C3).

- Group 3: A methyl group (from 2-methyl).

- Group 4: A hydrogen atom?

Wait, no, because if it's CH(CH3), then the substituents are:

- One methyl group.

- Two CH2 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, maybe I should write the structure. So the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So for C2, the substituents are:

- The carboxylic acid group (OOC-) on one side.

- The CH(CH3) group on the other side.

- A methyl group.

- And a hydrogen? No, wait, wait. No, in a CH(CH3) group, the carbon has three substituents: two CH2s and a methyl? No, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. Because each of them has four different substituents. For C2: the groups attached are CH(CH3) (from the right), OOC- (from the left), methyl, and another group. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of each CH(CH3) as a central carbon. Let me think: each of those carbons is attached to:

- The carboxylic acid group on one side (for C2, it's from C1, for C3, from C4).

- A methyl group.

- Two other substituents: perhaps two different groups. Wait, no, in the structure, each of these carbons is CH(CH3), so they have two CH(CH3) groups attached to each other? That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups (on either side), a methyl, and a hydrogen. Wait, that would make four substituents. But wait, if the carbon is CH(CH3), then it has three substituents: two CH2 groups and a methyl. No, that doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps each of these carbons doesn't have four different groups, so they aren't chiral centers. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they are chiral centers.

Wait, the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The fact that it's specified as (2R,3S) indicates that both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, so they have four different substituents. Therefore, this compound has two stereocenters and hence is optically active. So yes for this one.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   This is another succinic acid derivative with 2 and 3 methyl groups. Following the same logic as compound 3, since both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, this molecule also has chirality. So yes, it's optically active. So that's another yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The (R) configuration indicates a chiral center at C1. So, if the carbon with the OH has four different substituents, it's a chiral center. Let's check: C1 is attached to:

- OH group.

- The cyclohexene ring (which has different substituents around the ring, but as a substituent, it's a ring).

- Two other ring carbons, perhaps, but that might not be four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (or other substituents from the ring).

Wait, in cyclohexene, the ring is six-membered with a double bond. C1 is attached to OH, and the other substituents are part of the ring. So, let's imagine the structure: cyclohexene ring, with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is at C1. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH.

- The ring (which includes C2, C6, and C other groups).

But wait, in a ring, the substituents from the ring itself may not be identical. So C1 is connected to C2 (which is CH2?), C6 (which is CH2?), and the double bond? Wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (like C2 and C6), and the ring's double bond. Wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, so perhaps C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are each CH2 groups, and also the rest of the ring.

Wait, but for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So, is C1 attached to four different groups? Let me think: the substituents would be:

1. OH group.

2. The ring's C2 (which is CH2).

3. The ring's C6 (which is also CH2), but if the ring is unsaturated, perhaps C2 and C6 are different. Alternatively, perhaps they are CH2 groups, but if the ring is symmetric, then C2 and C6 might be the same.

Wait, the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

Positions:

1: OH

2: CH2

3: double bond (CH-CH2?)

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the chair conformation, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has substituents as:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the ring's bridge.

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are CH2 groups, then perhaps they're identical. So, C1 would have:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (same).

- And the ring's bridge, which is another group.

Wait, but that would make three substituents, but wait, actually, each substituent is a part of the ring, so perhaps C1 has four substituents: the OH, and three ring carbons. Since the ring is cyclohexene, perhaps C1 is connected to C2, C6, and the rest of the ring.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the (R) configuration indicates that C1 is a chiral center, which would mean it has four different substituents. Therefore, the molecule is optically active. So yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This compound has OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of cyclohexane. The substituents are all on the same face (since it's triol), but does this create chirality? Let's check each carbon. Each of the three OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) has four substituents. Let's see for C1: it's attached to C2, C6, and two OH groups? No, wait, each OH is on a different carbon. Wait, perhaps each of these carbons has four substituents: OH, and three different CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps each of them has two CH2 groups and two others. Wait, no, because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons (CH2 groups) and two other substituents.

Wait, for C1: substituents are:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6).

- The bridge to C6 and another bridge to C2? No, perhaps each carbon in cyclohexane is connected to two other carbons (so CH2 groups) and has two more substituents (like in a chair, axial and equatorial). But in this case, each of C1, C3, C5 has an OH. So C1's substituents are: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and another CH2 group (like C6?), which may not necessarily be different. Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) is a stereocenter. For a stereocenter, each must have four different groups. So for C1, if the substituents are: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and what else? Maybe the two CH2 groups are identical, making three substituents, not four. So, perhaps C1 isn't a chiral center. Wait, but in reality, the substituents on a cyclohexane ring are all CH2 groups, so unless there's another substituent, perhaps each of these carbons isn't a chiral center. Hmm, but in this case, the molecule has three OH groups. So, perhaps each of the three carbons has four substituents: OH, and three different groups.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having three stereocenters. The configuration is (1s,3s,5s), which implies each is a stereocenter. Therefore, each has four different substituents. So, yes, this compound is optically active. So yes.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO (butanone is usually 2-butanone, but 1-butanone would be CH2CH2COCH3, but that's not possible because ketones have the carbonyl at position 2). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no, butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-CO? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group of butanone. So, butan-1-one would be:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3? No, wait, the correct structure for 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

The carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)– ?

Wait, but butanone is four carbons in a row with the ketone. So butan-1-one would be O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. But in this case, the substituents are on the carbonyl carbon. So the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)– ?

Wait, that would make the carbonyl carbon attached to cyclopentyl, and the other substituents as CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–? No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think whether this molecule has any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The other carbons: let's see the structure. The carbonyl is at position 1, so the chain is:

O=C–R–CH2–CH(CH3)– ?

Where R is cyclopentyl. So the carbons after the carbonyl are:

C1: carbonyl (not a chiral center).

C2: attached to C1, has a CH2 group.

C3: attached to C2, has a CH(CH3).

C4: attached to C3, has a CH2 group.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. So in this case, substituents at C1 (carbonyl) are cyclopentyl and three other groups. Wait, no, but butan-1-one would be O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3, which isn't possible because that's a four-carbon chain with the carbonyl at the end, which is not feasible. So perhaps the correct structure is:

The carbonyl is at position 2, making it butan-2-one (which is methyl isopropyl ketone), but the question says butan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is O=C–(CH2)3–CH(CH3). No, but that would be pentan-1-one with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, so no. The substituents after the carbonyl are a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, and perhaps other CH2 groups. So, the carbons after the carbonyl are:

C2: connected to the carbonyl carbon. So substituents on C2: the carbonyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two CH2 groups. Are all four substituents different? Let's see: if C2 is attached to:

- Carbonyl group (O=C-).

- Cyclopentyl group.

- Two CH2 groups (leading to C3 and maybe another CH2).

Wait, but in reality, the structure is O=C–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, but that seems too long. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–, making the substituents on the carbons after the carbonyl as:

C2: attached to carbonyl, cyclopentyl, CH2, and another group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH(CH2CH3). No, but that would be a different substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–, so the substituents on C2 (the carbon after carbonyl) are: carbonyl, cyclopentyl, CH2, and another CH2. So, the substituents on C2 would be:

- O=C–.

- Cyclopentyl.

- CH2–CH(CH3).

- Another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents as:

C2: attached to O=C–, cyclopentyl, CH2–CH(CH3)–, and another CH2 group. But that doesn't seem to be four different groups because the CH2 groups might be similar. So, perhaps C2 is not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- O=C–.

- Cyclopentyl.

- CH2CH(CH3).

- H?

No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical activity. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, butan-1-one would have the structure O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. But in this case, the substituents are different. At position 3, there's a methyl. So, the structure would be O=C–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, but butanone has four carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–.

That would make the substituents on the carbons after the carbonyl as:

C2: cyclopentyl, CH2, and so on. Hmm, perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center. So, in this case, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity. So, no.

Now, let's tally up which compounds are optically active:

1. (Z) isomer: No.

2. Hexahydro...: Yes. (+1).

3. (2R,3S) succinic acid: Yes. (+1).

4. (2R,3R) succinic acid: Yes. (+1).

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes. (+1).

6. (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Yes. (+1).

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No.

So that's five yeses: compounds 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but that's five, but let me recount:

- Compound 2: yes.

- 3: yes.

- 4: yes.

- 5: yes.

- 6: yes.

So that's five. But wait, the options don't have an option with five. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check each compound.

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes.

3: Yes.

4: Yes.

5: Yes.

6: Yes.

7: No.

So that's five yeses. Looking back, the options include option A)5. So the answer would be 5. But wait, the options given are:

Options:
A)5
B)3
C)2
D)4

So the correct answer is A)5. But wait, the question is about how many of the seven compounds exhibit optical activity. So 5 yeses.

Wait, but let me recheck compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. We concluded yes, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again: C1 has OH, the ring, and other substituents. If C1 is a chiral center, then yes. So, yes.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: each of C1, C3, C5 is a stereocenter. So yes.

So, that brings the total to 5.

Wait, but I thought the options are:

A) 5
B)3
C)2
D)4

So the answer is A)5. But looking at the options, option A is 5, so that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond. While it has geometric isomerism (Z/E), it lacks a chiral center. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The (R) and (S) designations in the name indicate the presence of stereocenters. Since the molecule has chirality, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two central carbons (C2 and C3). Each of these carbons has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Thus, the molecule is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to compound 3, this molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3, making it optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group at C1 is attached to four different substituents: the hydroxyl group itself, the cyclohexene ring, and two other distinct groups. This makes C1 a chiral center, so the molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the cyclohexane ring. Each of these carbons has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule is optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center due to its double bond with oxygen. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so no chiral centers are present. This compound does not exhibit optical activity.

### Summary of Optical Activity:
- Compound 1: No  
- Compound 2: Yes  
- Compound 3: Yes  
- Compound 4: Yes  
- Compound 5: Yes  
- Compound 6: Yes  
- Compound 7: No  

A total of **5 compounds** exhibit optical activity.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of these seven compounds exhibit optical activity. Let me think about each one step by step.

First, I remember that optical activity means the compound has chirality. Chirality arises when a molecule has a stereocenter or a plane of asymmetry. So, if a molecule has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry, it can be optically active.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, so this is an alkene with substituents. The (Z) configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond. But do alkenes with E/Z isomerism have chirality? I don't think so because the double bond itself isn't a chiral center. Unless there's a stereogenic center elsewhere. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 has a methyl group and two CH2 groups maybe. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so with substitution. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So the molecule is Cl–C(=CH2–CH2CH3)–CH(CH3)? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 but that's a single bond. Wait, no, but it's but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 with substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond where? Oh, no, wait. The correct structure for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2–CH3? Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. For that, a carbon needs four different substituents. Let's see the structure again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and the double bond. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So C2 would be CH(CH3) attached to a double bond. So the substituents around C2 would be: CH3, CH2CH3, and two double bonds? Wait, no. In but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with substituents, 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on the second. So it's Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2–CH3? Wait, no, but that would make the molecule Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl–C(=CH(CH2CH3))–CH3? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check for stereocenters. If any carbon in the molecule has four different groups attached, it's a chiral center. Let's see: the molecule is (Z) configuration, but does that imply any stereogenic centers? The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups, perhaps. Wait, but C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2, which has a methyl and another CH2. Wait, perhaps C2 has a methyl, a H, and the double bond. So maybe the substituents around C2 are: CH3, H, and two CH2 groups. Wait, that doesn't make four different groups. So C2 wouldn't be a chiral center. So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? If not, then it's not optically active. So I think this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. So no for this one.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the molecule is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't sound right. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the answer is that it doesn't have a chiral center, so doesn't show optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   This is a more complex structure. Hexahydro suggests a six-membered ring, and methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione implies a fused ring system. The substituents are chloromethylene, which is a CH2Cl group attached with a double bond maybe? The (E) configuration suggests it's a double bond geometry. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Well, the R and S in the name indicate stereocenters. So 3aR and 7aS are stereocenters, so the molecule has them. Therefore, it has chirality, so it's optically active. So yes for this one.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In this case, the 2 and 3 positions are substituted with methyl groups. So the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. Let's check for C2: substituents are methyl, another CH(CH3) group, two carboxylic acid groups? Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. If it's 2 and 3 substituted, then each of those CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of the two central carbons has: a methyl, a CH(CH3), and two oxygen-containing groups. Let me see: C2 has a methyl, a CH(CH3), an OOC- group from the left, and another CH(CH3) from the right. So, substituents are: methyl, CH(CH3), OOC-CH2-CH2- (wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong). Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C3 has: on C2, a methyl, a CH(CH3), a carboxylic acid group (OOC-), and another substituent. Wait, maybe it's better to just imagine the structure.

Wait, the structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the central carbons (the two CH(CH3)) would have what substituents? Let's take C2: attached to two CH(CH3) groups, a methyl, and the rest? Wait, no. Each of these carbons would have:

- C2: connected to C1 (which is the OOC- group), C3 (another CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, what's the fourth substituent on C2? Oh, wait, no. Each of the two central carbons is CH(CH3), so each has two CH groups attached. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let's try to count the substituents on C2. If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- C2: attached to a COOH group (from C1), a CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, wait. No, because if it's 2 and 3 positions, each is CH(CH3). So each has:

- For C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), methyl, and another substituent. Wait, but that's four substituents. Let's enumerate them:

On C2 (the second carbon):

- One substituent is the carboxylic acid group from C1: OOC-.

- The other substituents are: CH(CH3) (attached to C3, which is the next carbon), a methyl group (from 2-methyl), and two others? Wait, no, each central carbon is CH(CH3), so each has two CH(CH3) groups, a methyl, and another group. Wait, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two middle carbons is CH(CH3), so each has a methyl and three other substituents. Wait, but each CH(CH3) would have two CH groups. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has four substituents: two CH(CH3) groups (on either side), a methyl, and another substituent. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has four different groups attached. Let's see for C2:

- Group 1: The carboxylic acid group (from C1: -COOH).

- Group 2: The CH(CH3) group (from C3).

- Group 3: A methyl group (from 2-methyl).

- Group 4: A hydrogen atom?

Wait, no, because if it's CH(CH3), then the substituents are:

- One methyl group.

- Two CH2 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, maybe I should write the structure. So the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So for C2, the substituents are:

- The carboxylic acid group (OOC-) on one side.

- The CH(CH3) group on the other side.

- A methyl group.

- And a hydrogen? No, wait, wait. No, in a CH(CH3) group, the carbon has three substituents: two CH2s and a methyl? No, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. Because each of them has four different substituents. For C2: the groups attached are CH(CH3) (from the right), OOC- (from the left), methyl, and another group. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of each CH(CH3) as a central carbon. Let me think: each of those carbons is attached to:

- The carboxylic acid group on one side (for C2, it's from C1, for C3, from C4).

- A methyl group.

- Two other substituents: perhaps two different groups. Wait, no, in the structure, each of these carbons is CH(CH3), so they have two CH(CH3) groups attached to each other? That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups (on either side), a methyl, and a hydrogen. Wait, that would make four substituents. But wait, if the carbon is CH(CH3), then it has three substituents: two CH2 groups and a methyl. No, that doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps each of these carbons doesn't have four different groups, so they aren't chiral centers. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they are chiral centers.

Wait, the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The fact that it's specified as (2R,3S) indicates that both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, so they have four different substituents. Therefore, this compound has two stereocenters and hence is optically active. So yes for this one.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   This is another succinic acid derivative with 2 and 3 methyl groups. Following the same logic as compound 3, since both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, this molecule also has chirality. So yes, it's optically active. So that's another yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group at C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The (R) configuration indicates a chiral center at C1. So, if the carbon with the OH has four different substituents, it's a chiral center. Let's check: C1 is attached to:

- OH group.

- The cyclohexene ring (which has different substituents around the ring, but as a substituent, it's a ring).

- Two other ring carbons, perhaps, but that might not be four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (or other substituents from the ring).

Wait, in cyclohexene, the ring is six-membered with a double bond. C1 is attached to OH, and the other substituents are part of the ring. So, let's imagine the structure: cyclohexene ring, with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is at C1. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH.

- The ring (which includes C2, C6, and C other groups).

But wait, in a ring, the substituents from the ring itself may not be identical. So C1 is connected to C2 (which is CH2?), C6 (which is CH2?), and the double bond? Wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (like C2 and C6), and the ring's double bond. Wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, so perhaps C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are each CH2 groups, and also the rest of the ring.

Wait, but for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So, is C1 attached to four different groups? Let me think: the substituents would be:

1. OH group.

2. The ring's C2 (which is CH2).

3. The ring's C6 (which is also CH2), but if the ring is unsaturated, perhaps C2 and C6 are different. Alternatively, perhaps they are CH2 groups, but if the ring is symmetric, then C2 and C6 might be the same.

Wait, the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

Positions:

1: OH

2: CH2

3: double bond (CH-CH2?)

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the chair conformation, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has substituents as:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the ring's bridge.

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are CH2 groups, then perhaps they're identical. So, C1 would have:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (same).

- And the ring's bridge, which is another group.

Wait, but that would make three substituents, but wait, actually, each substituent is a part of the ring, so perhaps C1 has four substituents: the OH, and three ring carbons. Since the ring is cyclohexene, perhaps C1 is connected to C2, C6, and the rest of the ring.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the (R) configuration indicates that C1 is a chiral center, which would mean it has four different substituents. Therefore, the molecule is optically active. So yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This compound has OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of cyclohexane. The substituents are all on the same face (since it's triol), but does this create chirality? Let's check each carbon. Each of the three OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) has four substituents. Let's see for C1: it's attached to C2, C6, and two OH groups? No, wait, each OH is on a different carbon. Wait, perhaps each of these carbons has four substituents: OH, and three different CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps each of them has two CH2 groups and two others. Wait, no, because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons (CH2 groups) and two other substituents.

Wait, for C1: substituents are:

- OH.

- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6).

- The bridge to C6 and another bridge to C2? No, perhaps each carbon in cyclohexane is connected to two other carbons (so CH2 groups) and has two more substituents (like in a chair, axial and equatorial). But in this case, each of C1, C3, C5 has an OH. So C1's substituents are: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and another CH2 group (like C6?), which may not necessarily be different. Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) is a stereocenter. For a stereocenter, each must have four different groups. So for C1, if the substituents are: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and what else? Maybe the two CH2 groups are identical, making three substituents, not four. So, perhaps C1 isn't a chiral center. Wait, but in reality, the substituents on a cyclohexane ring are all CH2 groups, so unless there's another substituent, perhaps each of these carbons isn't a chiral center. Hmm, but in this case, the molecule has three OH groups. So, perhaps each of the three carbons has four substituents: OH, and three different groups.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having three stereocenters. The configuration is (1s,3s,5s), which implies each is a stereocenter. Therefore, each has four different substituents. So, yes, this compound is optically active. So yes.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. So, the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO (butanone is usually 2-butanone, but 1-butanone would be CH2CH2COCH3, but that's not possible because ketones have the carbonyl at position 2). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no, butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-CO? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl group of butanone. So, butan-1-one would be:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3? No, wait, the correct structure for 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

The carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)– ?

Wait, but butanone is four carbons in a row with the ketone. So butan-1-one would be O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. But in this case, the substituents are on the carbonyl carbon. So the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)– ?

Wait, that would make the carbonyl carbon attached to cyclopentyl, and the other substituents as CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–? No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think whether this molecule has any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The other carbons: let's see the structure. The carbonyl is at position 1, so the chain is:

O=C–R–CH2–CH(CH3)– ?

Where R is cyclopentyl. So the carbons after the carbonyl are:

C1: carbonyl (not a chiral center).

C2: attached to C1, has a CH2 group.

C3: attached to C2, has a CH(CH3).

C4: attached to C3, has a CH2 group.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. So in this case, substituents at C1 (carbonyl) are cyclopentyl and three other groups. Wait, no, but butan-1-one would be O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3, which isn't possible because that's a four-carbon chain with the carbonyl at the end, which is not feasible. So perhaps the correct structure is:

The carbonyl is at position 2, making it butan-2-one (which is methyl isopropyl ketone), but the question says butan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is O=C–(CH2)3–CH(CH3). No, but that would be pentan-1-one with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, so no. The substituents after the carbonyl are a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, and perhaps other CH2 groups. So, the carbons after the carbonyl are:

C2: connected to the carbonyl carbon. So substituents on C2: the carbonyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two CH2 groups. Are all four substituents different? Let's see: if C2 is attached to:

- Carbonyl group (O=C-).

- Cyclopentyl group.

- Two CH2 groups (leading to C3 and maybe another CH2).

Wait, but in reality, the structure is O=C–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, but that seems too long. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–, making the substituents on the carbons after the carbonyl as:

C2: attached to carbonyl, cyclopentyl, CH2, and another group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH(CH2CH3). No, but that would be a different substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–, so the substituents on C2 (the carbon after carbonyl) are: carbonyl, cyclopentyl, CH2, and another CH2. So, the substituents on C2 would be:

- O=C–.

- Cyclopentyl.

- CH2–CH(CH3).

- Another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents as:

C2: attached to O=C–, cyclopentyl, CH2–CH(CH3)–, and another CH2 group. But that doesn't seem to be four different groups because the CH2 groups might be similar. So, perhaps C2 is not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- O=C–.

- Cyclopentyl.

- CH2CH(CH3).

- H?

No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical activity. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, butan-1-one would have the structure O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. But in this case, the substituents are different. At position 3, there's a methyl. So, the structure would be O=C–cyclopentyl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–?

Wait, but butanone has four carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

O=C–(cyclopentyl)–CH2–CH(CH3)–.

That would make the substituents on the carbons after the carbonyl as:

C2: cyclopentyl, CH2, and so on. Hmm, perhaps C2 isn't a chiral center. So, in this case, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity. So, no.

Now, let's tally up which compounds are optically active:

1. (Z) isomer: No.

2. Hexahydro...: Yes. (+1).

3. (2R,3S) succinic acid: Yes. (+1).

4. (2R,3R) succinic acid: Yes. (+1).

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes. (+1).

6. (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Yes. (+1).

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No.

So that's five yeses: compounds 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but that's five, but let me recount:

- Compound 2: yes.

- 3: yes.

- 4: yes.

- 5: yes.

- 6: yes.

So that's five. But wait, the options don't have an option with five. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check each compound.

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes.

3: Yes.

4: Yes.

5: Yes.

6: Yes.

7: No.

So that's five yeses. Looking back, the options include option A)5. So the answer would be 5. But wait, the options given are:

Options:
A)5
B)3
C)2
D)4

So the correct answer is A)5. But wait, the question is about how many of the seven compounds exhibit optical activity. So 5 yeses.

Wait, but let me recheck compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. We concluded yes, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again: C1 has OH, the ring, and other substituents. If C1 is a chiral center, then yes. So, yes.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: each of C1, C3, C5 is a stereocenter. So yes.

So, that brings the total to 5.

Wait, but I thought the options are:

A) 5
B)3
C)2
D)4

So the answer is A)5. But looking at the options, option A is 5, so that's the answer.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond. While it has geometric isomerism (Z/E), it lacks a chiral center. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The (R) and (S) designations in the name indicate the presence of stereocenters. Since the molecule has chirality, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two central carbons (C2 and C3). Each of these carbons has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Thus, the molecule is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to compound 3, this molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3, making it optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group at C1 is attached to four different substituents: the hydroxyl group itself, the cyclohexene ring, and two other distinct groups. This makes C1 a chiral center, so the molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the cyclohexane ring. Each of these carbons has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule is optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center due to its double bond with oxygen. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so no chiral centers are present. This compound does not exhibit optical activity.

### Summary of Optical Activity:
- Compound 1: No  
- Compound 2: Yes  
- Compound 3: Yes  
- Compound 4: Yes  
- Compound 5: Yes  
- Compound 6: Yes  
- Compound 7: No  

A total of **5 compounds** exhibit optical activity.

ANSWER: A
