Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's think about this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, in the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(k A² / m). That's option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't use the classical formula directly. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So I need to apply relativistic mechanics here.

Relativistic equations... The relativistic energy equation comes to mind. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², but wait, no. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². So their sum is conserved.

But in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So the total energy E = gamma mc². But in the oscillator, the potential energy and kinetic energy would vary as the mass moves. At maximum amplitude, the mass comes to rest for an instant, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy is (1/2)k x² + (gamma - 1) mc² = gamma mc². Wait, does that make sense? Let me think again.

Wait, when the mass is at x = A, it's at maximum displacement. At that point, its velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. The total energy is entirely potential, which would be (1/2)k A². But wait, no, because in the relativistic case, the potential energy is the same as the classical case, but the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, maybe I should write the energy conservation equation. At maximum displacement, the mass has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A^2. But in the relativistic case, the total energy is also equal to gamma mc² when the mass is at x=0 (maximum speed). So when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So at that point, E = gamma mc² = (1/2) k A².

So setting them equal: gamma mc² = (1/2)k A². So gamma = (k A²) / (2 m c²). Hmm, but wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v.

Gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (k² A^4) / (4 m² c^4). Rearranging, 1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4) / (k² A^4). So v²/c² = 1 - [ (4 m² c^4)/(k² A^4) ) ].

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, wait a second. If the total energy E is (1/2)k A², then at x=0, the energy is all kinetic. So E = K = (gamma -1) m c^2. Because in relativity, K = (gamma -1) m c^2. So E is the sum of potential and kinetic. At x=A, K=0, so E = (1/2)k A^2. At x=0, E = K = (gamma -1) m c^2. So (gamma -1) m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2. So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. I think I messed up the initial setup. So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as Q for simplicity. So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q.

Hmm, solving for v. Let's square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + Q)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + Q)^2.

Thus, v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2].

Which simplifies to v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2Q + Q² - 1) = 2Q + Q².

So v^2/c^2 = (2Q + Q²) / (1 + Q)^2.

Factor numerator: Q(2 + Q) / (1 + Q)^2.

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's substitute back.

v^2 = c² * [ Q(2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Hmm, substituting Q:

v^2 = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Let me simplify that. Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Let me write Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Numerator of the fraction inside becomes Q*(2 + Q) = Q(2 + Q).

Denominator is (1 + Q)^2.

So the whole expression is [Q(2 + Q)] / (1 + Q)^2.

Let me write everything step by step.

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Let me factor out (k A²/(2 m c²)) as Q for simplicity.

So v² = c² * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this in terms of Q.

Let me expand 2 + Q: 2 + Q = Q (2/Q + 1), but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps write this as [Q/(1+Q)] * [ (2 + Q) / (1 + Q) ) ].

Wait, 2 + Q = (1 + Q) +1. Hmm, but I don't see a straightforward way.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator.

Let me compute the fraction [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2.

So,

Q(2 + Q) = Q^2 + 2Q.

(1 + Q)^2 = 1 + 2Q + Q^2.

So the fraction is (Q² + 2Q) / (Q² + 2Q +1).

Hmm, that's (Q² + 2Q) / (Q +1)^2.

Wait, denominator (1 + Q)^2 is (Q +1)^2.

So perhaps this can be written as [ Q (Q + 2) ] / (Q +1)^2.

Hmm, I don't see a clear simplification. Maybe another approach.

Wait, let's go back. From the expression:

gamma = 1 + Q, where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Then, gamma = [ (k A^2) + 2 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Taking reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c^2) = (2 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = [4 m² c^4 ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ]

So, v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I should write that as a fraction:

v²/c² = [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 - 4 m² c^4 ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(k A² + 2 m c² )^2 = k² A^4 + 4 k A² m c² + 4 m² c^4.

Subtract 4 m² c^4:

k² A^4 +4k A² m c² +4 m² c^4 -4 m² c^4 = k² A^4 +4k A² m c².

So numerator is k² A^4 +4k A² m c².

Factor numerator:

k A² (k A² +4 m c² )

Denominator is (k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [k A² (k A² +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me see:

Numerator: k A² (k A² +4 m c² )

Denominator: (k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [k A² (k A² +4 m c² ) ] / (k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2.

But perhaps we can factor this differently. Let me see:

Let me factor (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 = (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

So, the numerator has a term (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) which is (k A² +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps take the square root to get v.

v = c * sqrt( [k A² (k A² +4 m c^2 ) ] ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) )

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression in terms of Q again.

Wait, let's think about the options given. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2m) ))² )

Hmm, that seems to have a (1 - something) in the denominator inside the sqrt.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Option C: v_max = sqrt(k A²/m ) → the non-relativistic case.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, perhaps we can manipulate our expression to match one of these.

We have:

v² = c² [ (k A² + 4 m c^2 ) k A² ] / (k A^2 + 2m c^2 )^2 .

Let me see. Let me write it as:

v² = [ k A² (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ] * c^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v² = [ (k A^2) (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ] * c².

Let me factor 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c^2 )

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 = [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, looking at option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )). Let's compute that.

Option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Compute 1/(1 - x) where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So 1 + 1/(1 -x) = 1 + [1/(1-x)] = (1 -x +1 )/(1 -x) )= (2 -x)/(1 -x).

So inside the sqrt, it's (2 -x)/(1 -x).

So sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) ) → which would be sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 -x) )

Which is sqrt( [ (2 - x) ] / [ (1 -x) ] )

Hmm, not sure.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 + y ), where y = (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )).

So 1 - [1/(1 + y ) ] = [ (1 + y ) -1 ]/(1 + y ) = y/(1 + y )

So sqrt( y/(1 + y ) ), multiplied by c.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps let's go back. Let me express our expression for v in terms of Q.

Wait, earlier we had:

gamma = 1 + Q.

Where Q = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = (1 + Q) = (1 / sqrt(1-v^2/c^2 ) )

So, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + Q )

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + Q )^2.

So, v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + Q )^2 ] = [ (1 + Q )^2 -1 ] / (1 + Q )^2

Which is ( (1 + 2Q + Q^2 ) -1 ) / (1 + Q )^2 = (2Q + Q^2 ) / (1 + Q )^2.

So, v = c * sqrt( (2Q + Q² ) / (1 + Q )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ Q(2 + Q) ] ) / (1 + Q )

But Q = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Let me simplify the expression inside the square root.

The numerator inside the sqrt is [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 ) * (2 m c^2 ) )

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Thus, the sqrt of this is sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / 4 m^2 c^4 )

= [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, so putting it all together, v = c * [ (A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )) / (2 m c^2 ) ] / ( [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

Wait, denominator is (1 + Q ) which is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * [ (A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

The (2 m c^2 ) terms cancel out in numerator and denominator.

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, let me factor the term inside the sqrt:

k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is incorrect because when you take 1/(1 - ... ), it could lead to a higher value than c, which is impossible. Wait, but let's see:

In option B, the expression inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) )).

So let me compute that: 1 + 1/(1 - x) = (1 -x +1 )/(1 -x ) = (2 -x )/(1 -x ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So the sqrt is sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) )

Then, v = c * sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) )

Wait, but if x is small (non-relativistic case), then x is much less than 1, so (2 -x)/(1 -x) ≈ (2)/(1 ) → v ≈ c * sqrt(2), which is larger than the non-relativistic case. But that doesn't make sense because in non-relativistic, v_max is sqrt( k A^2 / m ), as in option C.

Hmm, but in reality, when x is small, perhaps the sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) ) ≈ sqrt(2 (1 - x/2)/(1 -x) ), which might approach sqrt(2) as x approaches zero.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) → very small since c is large. So, in the limit as x approaches zero, v_max = c * sqrt( 2/1 ) = c * sqrt(2 ). But that contradicts the non-relativistic case, which is option C.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))² )

Wait, let me compute that:

1 - [1/(1 + y ) ] where y = (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )).

So it's 1 - [1/(1 + y ) ] = [ (1 + y ) -1 ]/(1 + y ) = y/(1 + y )

So, inside the sqrt, it's y/(1 + y )

So, v = c * sqrt( y/(1 + y ) )

Which is c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) / ( 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] )

= c * sqrt( [k A^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] )

= c * sqrt( [k A^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] )

= c * [ A sqrt( k ) ] / sqrt( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, but when k A^2 is much smaller than 2 m c^2 (non-relativistic case), the denominator becomes sqrt(2 m c^2 ), and the numerator is A sqrt(k) * c.

So,

v_max ≈ c * (A sqrt(k) ) / sqrt(2 m c² )

= c * (A sqrt(k) ) / ( sqrt(2) m c )

= A sqrt( k ) / ( sqrt(2) m )

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt( k A² / m )

But in non-relativistic case, option C is v = sqrt(k A²/m ), but here we get (1/sqrt(2)) times that. So that can't be right. So option D doesn't match the non-relativistic limit either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the denominator in the expression for v^2/c^2 that I derived earlier:

v²/c² = [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Numerator: k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Hmm, maybe I can write as:

[ k A^2 (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) ] = k A^2 [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ]

So,

= k A^2 (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2.

Denominator is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A^2 (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Break into two terms:

= [ k A^2 (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ] / denominator + [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / denominator.

= [k A^2 ]/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ]/( denominator )

Wait, denominator is (k ... )^2. So,

= [ k A^2 ]/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + [ 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express it in terms of gamma.

Earlier, we found gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

And,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Then,

1 - v²/c² = [4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 -4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(2 m c^2 )^2 + 2 * 2 m c^2 * k A^2 + (k A^2 )^2 - 4 m^2 c^4

= 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 -4 m^2 c^4

Simplify:

= 4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4.

Factor numerator:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )

So,

v²/c² = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

But wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the denominator. 2 m c² +k A² is the same as (k A² + 2 m c^2 ). So,

v²/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c² +k A^2 ) ]/(k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ]/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Which can be written as [k A^2 (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2 ] / denominator^2.

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] = [k A^2 (k A^2 +2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ].

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps recognize that 4 m c^2 = 2 * 2 m c^2.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as [k A^2 ( (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / denominator.

Which then becomes [k A^2 (denominator + 2 m c^2 ) ] / denominator^2.

But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps let me factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is k² A^4 +4 k A^2 m c^2.

Denominator is (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2 =k² A^4 +4 k A^2 m c^2 +4 m² c^4.

So,

v²/c² = [k² A^4 +4 k A^2 m c^2 ] / [k² A^4 +4 k A^2 m c^2 +4 m² c^4 ]

Hmm, which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ (k² A^4 +4 k A^2 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k² A^4 +4 k A^2 m c^2 ) +4 m^2 c^4 ]

So, if I factor numerator as (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) * something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps the denominator can be written as (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Which is (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) squared.

So,

v²/c² = [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, can we write this as [k A^2 ]/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) multiplied by (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ?

Yes, because:

[ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2 = [k A^2/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ]

So,

= [k A^2/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ]

= [k A^2/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

= [k A^2/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 1 + 2 m c^2/(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ]

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the options. Maybe none of the options directly match, but perhaps one can be manipulated to match.

Looking again:

Option A: c * sqrt[ 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m) ) )^2 ]

Hmm, the denominator inside the sqrt is (1 - (k A^2/(2m) ))^2. But in our setup, the denominator should involve (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) )), because earlier gamma was 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )).

So, option A has (k A^2/(2m) ), which has a denominator without c^2. That would make the argument of the sqrt much larger, perhaps giving a higher speed than possible, since c is the speed limit.

Option B: ... (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which fits with our variable Q.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute this:

Inside sqrt, 1 - [1/(1+y )^2 ] where y = (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )).

Which is [ (1+y )^2 -1 ] / (1+y )^2 = [ 1 + 2y + y^2 -1 ] / (1+y )^2 = [ 2y + y² ] / (1+y )^2.

Which is same as [ y (y + 2 ) ] / (1 + y )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( y (y + 2 ) ) / (1 + y )

But y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + 2 ) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Let me compute that numerator inside the sqrt:

= [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) * ( (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ]

So, sqrt of numerator: [ A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Then, v = c * [ A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Which simplifies to:

c * [ A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 m c^2 / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) ) ]

The (2 m c^2 ) terms cancel.

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Which matches the expression I derived earlier.

Wait, but that's the same as our earlier expression. So, option D gives the same expression as our derivation.

Wait, no, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Which we found is equal to the expression leading to v as above.

So, according to this, option D is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check.

In our derivation, we found that v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Which can be written as c * sqrt( (k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )) ) / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Which is what we have.

Now, looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Which, after manipulation, gives the same result as our expression.

So, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is conserved and includes both potential and kinetic energy. At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential: 

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we find:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2.
\]

Rearranging, the Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation principle or fail to reduce to the correct non-relativistic limit.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect because the denominator inside the square root involves \( (1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2 \), which lacks the necessary \( c^2 \) in the denominator, leading to unphysical results.
- **Option B:** Incorrect because the expression inside the square root does not correctly account for relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option C:** This is the non-relativistic result, \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), but it does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D:** Correct, as shown above, it matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
