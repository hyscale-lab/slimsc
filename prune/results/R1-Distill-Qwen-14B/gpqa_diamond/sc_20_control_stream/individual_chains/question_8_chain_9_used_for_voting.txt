Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine plants, specifically related to their resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. So, they've done some experiments with knock-out mutants and double mutants and are trying to figure out the gene relationships.

The setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to resistance. They made knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results are the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control. The control has 100% resistance.

Looking at the results:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance to 3/4 of normal.
- g2 has 0% resistance. So, knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance.
- g3 has 50% resistance. Knocking out G3 reduces resistance to half.
- The double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's even lower than either g1 or g3 alone.
   - g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.
   - g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.

Hmm, okay. So, the question is about the interactions between these genes. The options given involve concepts like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

First, I need to recall what each term means.

A transcription factor is a protein that helps regulate the expression of other genes. So, if one of these genes encodes a transcription factor, it would act upstream of other genes, meaning it's involved in regulating their expression.

Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. But in this context, I'm not sure how it applies. Maybe when one gene's function is redundant with another, they might show similar phenotypes when mutated.

Gene redundancy is when two or more genes can perform the same function. So, if knocking out one doesn't cause a problem, but knocking out both does, it suggests redundancy.

Epistasis is when the expression of one gene masks or modifies the expression of another. The gene that's epistatic is downstream; because if you have a mutation in a downstream gene, it can affect the phenotype regardless of the upstream gene's state. So, epistatic genes are downstream, and hypostatic are upstream.

So, the key here is to determine the relationships between G1, G2, and G3 based on their mutant and double mutant phenotypes.

Looking at the resistance levels:

g2 knockout is the most severe, giving 0% resistance. So, G2 seems essential for resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, then its absence would mean that the genes it regulates (maybe G1 and/or G3?) aren't expressed, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out (like in g2g3 or g1g2), the resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because, even if you have a mutation in G1, the presence of a g2 mutation masks it (since both double mutants have 0%). So, the presence of a g2 mutation determines the phenotype regardless of G1 or G3 status.

So, G2 is downstream of the others because its mutation is epistatic. That would mean G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes (since if it's a transcription factor, it's regulating other genes).

Wait, no. Wait. If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream, so it would regulate other genes (like G1 and G3). So, if G2 is knocked out, then the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't be expressed because their regulation is dependent on G2.

So, in the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen. That suggests that either G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3, or that G2 is the key gene responsible for the resistance.

Wait, but the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe G2 is that transcription factor.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then perhaps it activates G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed.

But looking at the data:

In the single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So, when G1 is knocked out, resistance drops to 3/4. So, G1 contributes to resistance, but G2's knockout is worse.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So, G3's knockout reduces resistance more than G1's.

- g2 is 0%, so it's the most severe.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So, even when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is same as g2 alone. So, G1's presence isn't making any difference when G2 is also knocked out. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is not present, G1 can't contribute anything. So, the phenotype is solely determined by G2. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So, G3's function doesn't matter when G2 is knocked out.

What about g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So, knocking out both G1 and G3 together makes things worse than either alone. That suggests that they function in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, their combined effect is additive (or more than additive). So, if G1 and G3 were in the same pathway, you might see a similar phenotype as the more severe single mutant. But here, it's worse, so it's like they're redundant or in separate pathways.

Wait, but if they were redundant, knocking out both would be like knocking out one. But here, when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single, so perhaps they contribute to different parts of the resistance pathway.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So, each provides some resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, perhaps, or maybe they are both downstream of G2.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then it would activate both G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed.

But wait, in the data, the g1 mutant still has some resistance (75%) and g3 mutant has 50%. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are independently contributing, but their expression is only possible when G2 is present.

Wait no, because in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either. So, both contribute to resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, they don't contribute at all. So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So, G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither gene is expressed, leading to 0% resistance, which matches the data.

Now, considering the single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance, which is less than the wild-type. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%. So, G1 contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor.

g3: 50% resistance. So, knocking out G3 reduces resistance by 50%.

So, G3's function is more critical than G1's, perhaps.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since each single mutant (g1 and g3) has 75% and 50% respectively, the combined effect is much worse. So, the two genes must function in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant's resistance would be the same as the most severe single mutant. But here, they're worse when both are knocked out, suggesting they contribute additively.

So, without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So, in the double mutants where both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present (like if any?), but no, in the question, the double mutants are all the possible combinations.

Wait, the double mutants are all the possible combinations of two knocked-out genes. So, the double mutants include g1g2, g1g3, g2g3.

In the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, in that case, since G2 is functional, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, what's the resistance? It's 10%, which is worse than either single (g1 at 75, g3 at 50). Wait, that's confusing. Because if G2 is functional, then why is the resistance so low?

Wait, no. Wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But since G2 is present, what's the resistance? Because G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. If G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2 can't activate them. So, the only resistance comes from other factors. Wait, but in the wild-type, G2 is present and activates G1 and G3, which contribute to resistance.

Hmm, but the g1g3 mutant is when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, even though G2 is present, it can't activate G1 or G3 because those genes are knocked out. So, the resistance would be whatever else is present besides G1 and G3. But if the resistance is 10%, then that's just whatever other factors are contributing.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 and g3 are only partially resistant. So, in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so their contributions are gone. So, the remaining resistance would be from whatever else is present.

But the data shows that the resistance is 10% in g1g3, which is worse than either single mutant. So, the double mutant's phenotype is worse than both single mutants, but not as bad as the triple mutant (which isn't shown, but we can infer).

So, back to the options. The question asks which conclusion about the genes' interactions can be drawn.

Looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the data, G2 is the one with the most severe phenotype. So, if G2 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean that G2 is downstream. So, in g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2. So, this would align with G2 being downstream.

But according to the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, so perhaps G2 is a transcription factor. Then G1 and G3 may be downstream.

But in option A, G1 is the transcription factor, which doesn't match because g1 has 75% resistance, which is less than 100%, but not 0. So, if G1 were a transcription factor, then knocking it out would lead to lower resistance. But it's not as severe as G2's knockout. So, maybe G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter? That would mean they're part of the same operon, which is more common in prokaryotes. In plants, it's less likely. Also, the data for double mutants might not support that. Also, G3 is epistatic towards G1 – so G3 is downstream. But when you knock out G1 and G2, the resistance is 0% (g1g2). So, G2 is epistatic to G1, not G3. Hmm, not sure about this.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy would mean a single gene affecting multiple traits. But the data doesn't indicate that. However, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, perhaps they have other functions. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, so they might not be pleiotropic but rather additive.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make it worse than either. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has resistance of 10%, which is worse than either single, so that suggests that they are not redundant but perhaps additive. So, D's first part might not fit.

Wait, but looking again: if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, their double knockout would have an additive effect, which is what we see (g1g3 is 10% compared to 75% and 50%). So, if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, and when both are knocked out, you lose all their contributions, leading to the 10% resistance. So, G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are not redundant but function in parallel pathways.

So, looking at the options, option C is G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, I don't think that's correct because the data doesn't show any pleiotropic effects. G1 and G3 are each only affecting the resistance trait.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as I thought earlier, gene redundancy would mean that when both are knocked out, the phenotype is the same as when either is. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than either single. So, they are not redundant, which suggests that D's second point is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: let's think about epistasis in the double mutants.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 has 0% resistance. So, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1.

g2g3 has 0% regardless of G3.

g1g3 has 10% resistance.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effect of G1 or G3.

So, G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, or is the key gene.

But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, it's upstream, so how can it be epistatic? Because if it's a transcription factor, it's regulating the others. So, if G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 can't be expressed, hence the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3.

So, that's why in the double mutants where G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3 status.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which would mean G2 is downstream. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. Epistasis is when a gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene. So, if G2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then G1 and G3 are downstream. So, in the double mutants, if G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't function because G2 isn't activating them. So, the phenotype is determined by G2's mutation, not G1 or G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, which option says G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic?

Looking at option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. But this option says G1 is a transcription factor, which I don't think fits.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, so that's correct, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3 is downstream of G1.

But in the data, the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either single. So, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant's resistance would be determined by G3's mutation. But g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than both single mutants. That doesn't fit with G3 being epistatic.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy. The data doesn't show that G1 and G3 affect other traits.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because g1g3 is worse than either single, so they are not redundant.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but are not redundant. But I thought redundancy implies that knocking out either doesn't affect the pathway, but knocking out both does.

Hmm.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 may be in parallel pathways. So, each contributes independently to resistance. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is the sum of their individual contributions.

Ah, so in the wild-type, when G2 is present, it activates G1 and G3. Each of these genes contributes to resistance. So, when G1 is knocked out, you lose 25% resistance (75% left). When G3 is knocked out, you lose 50% (50% left). When both are knocked out, you lose 75% + 50% = 125%, but since that's more than 100%, the resistance is 100 - 125% = negative, which isn't possible. So, perhaps it's additive but limited by the maximum.

Wait, but the data shows g1g3 resistance is 10%, which is even worse than either single. So, maybe G1 and G3 are acting in the same pathway, and their combined knockout is worse than either alone. But that doesn't fit with parallel pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps they are in the same pathway, but each contributes a certain amount, and their combined effect is additive. But in that case, the double mutant's resistance would be 25% +50% of control, but that would be 75%? But the data shows 10%. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe another approach: think about whether the genes act in the same pathway or in parallel.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of both, leading to no resistance (as seen in g2, 0%).

In the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, suggesting that each contributes some level to resistance. So, perhaps each gene (G1 and G3) is part of a separate pathway that contributes to the overall resistance. So, G2 activates both, but each gene's product works through a different mechanism.

When you knock out both G1 and G3, you lose both pathways, leading to a much lower resistance (10%). So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance.

Now, looking at the options, which option reflects this?

Looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because I don't see pleiotropy here.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because the double mutant is worse than either single, indicating they're not redundant.

Wait, another thought: in the double mutants, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, perhaps each contributes a part of the resistance. So, in the absence of G2, resistance is zero. But in the absence of G1, you have 25% (so G3 is contributing 75% on its own). Wait, no, because in the single mutant g3, resistance is 50%, not 75%.

Wait, maybe I should model this with numbers.

Let’s imagine that the total resistance is the sum of contributions from G1 and G3.

In the wild-type, G1 contributes X, G3 contributes Y, and perhaps other factors contribute Z.

When G2 is knocked out, X and Y are zero, so resistance is Z, which is 0% as per the data. So, Z is zero, and all resistance comes from G1 and G3.

In the single mutant g1: G1 is knocked out, so resistance is Y (from G3) plus Z. Since in the wild-type, the total is X + Y + Z =100%. But when G2 is knocked out, Z is 0, so X + Y =0? No, because g2 has 0% resistance.

Wait, perhaps the model is that G1 and G3 are the only contributors, and their contributions are additive.

So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are active.

In the wild-type: resistance is G1 + G3 =100%.

In g1: G1 is 0, so G3 = 100% → but data shows g1 has 75% resistance. So that doesn’t fit.

Hmm, perhaps it's a multiplicative model? Or perhaps each gene contributes a certain amount.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each gene as contributing to the same pathway, but in a way that each has a partial effect.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the epistatic relationships.

Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (because the double mutants with G2 knocked out have 0% resistance), G2 must be downstream of both. Wait, no. If G2 is epistatic, that means it's downstream. Because the gene that is epistatic is the one whose mutation masks the effect of the other genes.

Wait, let me think: in the pathway, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then a mutation in B is epistatic to a mutation in A. Because the product of A is upstream, so whether A is functional or not doesn't matter if B isn't functional.

So, for example, if A produces a signal that activates B, and B produces an inhibitor of the pathogen, then a mutation in B (nonfunctional) would lead to susceptibility regardless of A's status.

So, in this case, if G2 is epistatic to G1, that suggests that G2 is downstream of G1.

Wait, but in our case, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which would mean that G2 is downstream of both.

But earlier, we thought that G2 is a transcription factor, which would place it upstream of G1 and G3. That would mean that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, so G2 is not epistatic but rather hypostatic.

Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me think again.

Epistasis is about which gene is upstream or downstream in a pathway. If gene A is upstream of gene B, then a mutation in B (so B is nonfunctional) is epistatic to a mutation in A. Because whether A is functional or not doesn't matter if B isn't working.

So, for example, if A → B → phenotype, then:

- a mutation in A (nonfunctional) can't send the signal to B, so the phenotype is as if B isn't working.

But if B is mutated, the signal from A can't proceed, so the same phenotype.

Wait, no, in that case, a mutation in B would mask the effect of A.

So, in the pathway A → B → C (phenotype), if A is mutated, B doesn't get the signal, so C can't be produced. If B is mutated, same result.

So, in that case, A is upstream of B, but a mutation in B is epistatic to a mutation in A.

So, in that scenario, B is epistatic to A. Because the phenotype of a B mutation is the same as an A mutation, even though A is upstream.

So, applying that here: if G2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then G1 and G3 are downstream. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%, same as when G1 and G2 are both knocked out (g1g2). So, the presence of a G2 knockout masks the effect of G1.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1. But G2 is upstream, so how does that work?

Wait, perhaps because G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So, in the double mutant g1g2, G1 is not expressed because G2 is knocked out. So, the phenotype is the same as g2.

Similarly, in the g2g3 mutant, G3 isn't expressed because G2 is knocked out, so phenotype is same as g2.

So, in that case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because the presence of a G2 mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But in the pathway, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. So, how does that reconcile with the concept of epistasis?

Ah, perhaps it's because G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 can't function regardless of their own status. So, in the double mutants, the presence of G2's mutation determines the phenotype.

So, G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Doesn't fit because we think G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

No, the same promoter is unlikely. Also, G3 isn't epistatic.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because G1 isn't epistatic; G2 is.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because there's no redundancy.

Wait, none of the options perfectly fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2 being epistatic would suggest it is downstream, but if G1 is the TF, that might not fit.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter is unlikely. Also, G3 is epistatic, which would mean G3 is downstream. But when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So, perhaps G3 is more critical.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy isn't evident. Epistasis here would say G1 is downstream of G3, which doesn't fit our data.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because gene redundancy isn't supported.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not seeing why. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, which suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, their functions are additive. So, in the presence of G2, knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to very low resistance.

Which would suggest that G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in separate pathways. Thus, they don't show redundancy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function in a way that their combined knockout is worse than either. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which of the options correctly describes the epistatic relationships?

We know that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option says G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to others?

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, only G2 is epistatic to G1, not to G3.

But our data shows that G2 is epistatic to both.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3 is downstream of G1.

But our data doesn't show that. Because the g1g3 double mutant has 10%, which is worse than either single.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A? Let me think again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G1 is the transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, more severe than G1's 75%. So, if G1 were a TF, then knocking it out would reduce resistance more than G2's knockout. But it's the opposite.

So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's try to find the conclusion.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout is the most severe, and it's epistatic to G1 and G3. So, the correct option should have G2 as TF and G2 being epistatic.

So, looking again:

Option A: no, G1 as TF.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 epistatic towards G1.

But our data shows G2 is epistatic towards both.

So, none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, the options are:

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I don't see any evidence of pleiotropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, in option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So, perhaps they are co-regulated by G2. So, when G2 is knocked out, both are not expressed. But in the single mutants, each shows some resistance, so that must come from the other.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are under the same promoter, they are co-regulated. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither is expressed. But in the single mutants, each is expressed.

But the data for the double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is much lower than either single. So, that supports that they're in separate pathways.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, so their combined knockout leads to additive effects. So, they are not redundant, but their functions are additive.

Looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy.

No, I don't think so.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because they’re not redundant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but G1 is epistatic to G3. That would mean G1 is downstream of G3. But when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, and G3's knockout is 50%, which suggests that G1's effect is stronger. So, if G1 is downstream, then G3 is upstream. But the double mutant would have the same resistance as G1 knockout. But in the data, the double mutant is worse.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to restate the data in terms of epistasis.

G2's mutation masks the effects of G1 and G3. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, in the pathway, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3? Or upstream?

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, it's upstream, regulating G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream, but when it's knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. So, in that case, the mutation in G2 (upstream) masks (is epistatic to) the mutations in G1 and G3 (downstream). But that's counter to what I thought earlier.

Wait, usually, the gene that is epistatic is the one downstream. Because when a downstream gene is mutated, the upstream genes' effects can't be felt.

So, if G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then mutations in G1 or G3 (downstream) would be epistatic to G2's mutations.

But in our data, when G2 is mutated, the phenotype is 0%, regardless of G1 or G3. So, that would mean G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which suggests that G2 is downstream.

But that's conflicting with G2 being a transcription factor.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor and is downstream. That doesn't make sense because transcription factors are usually upstream.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The only option where G2 is a transcription factor is option B and C.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, that means they're co-regulated. So, knocking out G2 would prevent both from being expressed. But in the single mutants, they have some resistance, so they must be expressed when G2 is present.

But the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. If G1 and G3 are co-regulated, then knocking out both (g1g3) would have the same effect as knocking out G2, but the data shows 10%, not 0%. So, there's something else contributing.

Hmm. Maybe this is pointing me towards option C.

Wait, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, G1 is downstream of G3. So, the phenotype of G1's mutation would mask G3's.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single, which doesn't fit with epistasis. Because if G1 is downstream, then a mutation in G1 would mask G3's effect, and g1g3 should have the same resistance as g1.

But data shows g1g3 is worse than g1, so that can't be.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of each possibility.

If G2 is a transcription factor (so upstream), then in the double mutants where G2 is present (like g1g3), G2 is active. So, G1 and G3 are expressed. But in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out. So, their products are not present. So, the resistance is 10%, which must be due to other factors.

Hmm, but the data indicates that when G2 is not knocked out, the double mutant's resistance is worse than either single. So, in the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, G2 is a transcription factor, so it can activate other genes. But if G1 and G3 are the only downstream genes involved in resistance, then knocking them both would lead to loss of resistance. But in the data, the resistance is 10%, which suggests that some other factors are contributing.

Alternatively, maybe G2's function is to activate G1 and G3, and when both are knocked out, the remaining resistance is due to other, non-G2 pathways.

Wait, but in the wild-type, G2 is necessary for G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't contribute. So, their contribution is zero, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are active. So, why is the resistance only 10%?

Ah, perhaps because G1 and G3 are not the only contributors. There are other genes contributing to resistance as well, which are not regulated by G2.

In that case, the g1g3 mutant would lose the contributions from G1 and G3, but retain some resistance from other genes, hence 10%.

So, G2's role is to regulate G1 and G3, but the total resistance comes from other genes as well. But when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't contribute, but the other genes might also be affected.

Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, so all resistance comes through G2.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Let me think about epistasis again.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% when G2 is functional. So, G1 and G3 contribute 90% of the resistance when both are functional. That means that their combined effect is additive, not redundant.

So, when both are knocked out, resistance drops from 100% to 10%. So, each provides about 85% (but not exactly, since 75% +50% =125%, but the total is 100%). So, perhaps additive.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, their combined knockout leads to the sum of their contributions being lost, leading to 10% resistance.

So, in this scenario, G2 is a transcription factor regulating both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Now, looking back at the options, which says G2 is a transcription factor, and that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (not showing redundancy, not showing pleiotropy).

So, the correct option must have G2 as TF, and G1 and G3 not showing redundancy but their combined effect is additive (so resistance is lower than either single).

Looking at the options:

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because no pleiotropy.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because they don't show redundancy.

Wait, but maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the correct answer is option A: G1 is a transcription factor. No, because G2's knockout is worse.

Hmm, I think I have to make a choice here. Based on the data that G2's knockout is the most severe and epistatic to both G1 and G3, the correct option must have G2 as the transcription factor and G2 being epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3 is downstream of G1. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than either, so G3 isn't epistatic.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. No, because no pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. No, because they aren't redundant.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me rethink the epistatic relationships.

If G2 is a transcription factor, which is necessary for G1 and G3, then:

- In g2: G1 and G3 are not expressed → resistance 0%.
- In g1: G1 is not expressed, but G2 and G3 are → resistance 75%.
- In g3: G3 not expressed, G1 and G2 are → resistance 50%.

So, G2 is necessary for G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g2: G1 and G2 are not expressed → G3 is expressed (since G2 is not required for G3's expression in this model. Wait, no, because G2 is the TF for both. So, in g1g2, G2 is knocked out, so G3 isn't expressed. So, resistance is 0%.

Ah, so in this model, G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But G2 is functional, so G2 can activate other genes. Wait, but in this case, G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, so knocking out G1 and G3 doesn't affect G2's ability to function elsewhere. So, perhaps G2 has other targets.

But in the data, the resistance is 10% in g1g3, which suggests that other genes besides G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their expression isn't affected by G1 or G3's knockout.

So, back to the options.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, G1 is downstream. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which is not consistent with G1 being epistatic.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. Thus, their combined knockout leads to additive effects, making the resistance worse than either single.

So, which option reflects this?

Looking at the options, perhaps none of them explicitly state this. But among the options given, the most plausible one is option C or D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, the options are confusing. Another approach: look for the epistatic relationships.

Which gene's mutation masks the effect of another?

In the data, when G2 is mutated, the effect of G1 and G3 is masked. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2 is downstream.

But earlier, we thought G2 is a transcription factor, which is upstream. So, this seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that is downstream of G1 and G3. But that doesn't make sense because transcription factors are usually upstream.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I think I'm stuck and need to choose the best possible option.

The correct answer is option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I don’t see how G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. They each contribute to resistance, but pleiotropy refers to affecting multiple traits, which isn't indicated here.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not confident. Based on the data, G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, looking for an option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic.

In the options, option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1, which doesn't fit.

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, but not towards G3.

Wait, in the data, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So, the correct option must have G2 being epistatic to both.

So, looking for an option where G2 is a TF and is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But none of the options directly state that.

Wait, option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because G2 is epistatic to both.

I think I've gone in circles and need to make a decision. Based on the data, G2 is the key gene, acting as a TF, and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, the correct option would have G2 as TF, and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, the only one that has G2 as TF is B, C, and D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Which would mean that G1 is downstream. But the data for g1g3 shows worse resistance than either, which doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Their combined knockout leads to additive effects. So, which option reflects this?

The only option where G2 is a TF is B, C, and D.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But they don't because their combined knockout is worse than either single.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. I think the correct answer is option A is wrong because G2 is the TF.

Maybe I should think of this as a pathway where G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

In that case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, the correct option would have G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, only option A says G2 is epistatic to G1, but not G3.

So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options correctly fit, but that can't be.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with option C despite doubts. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: in the double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2 is downstream.

But earlier, we thought G2 is a transcription factor, which is upstream.

This is a contradiction. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has G1 as a TF. But that doesn't fit with G2's knockout being the most severe.

I think I'm stuck. I'll take a guess and say the correct answer is option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Maybe the correct answer is option B.

Wait, option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which would mean they're co-regulated. If they're both knocked out, but G2 is functional, then their contributions are gone, leading to lower resistance. So, in the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. But if they're co-regulated by G2, then in the single mutants, each would have some resistance. So, option B could fit.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll conclude with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes, G1, G2, and G3, based on their contributions to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine plants. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and relationships.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (loss of G1 reduces resistance by 25%).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (loss of G3 reduces resistance by 50%).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

3. **Epistasis**:
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effects of G1 and G3 mutations.
   - The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, likely through separate pathways.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent because G2 is the most severe mutant (0% resistance), and there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data.
  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. The idea of G1 and G3 sharing the same promoter is unlikely, as the double mutant g1g3 shows resistance (10%), indicating that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant or co-regulated. Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the resistance of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data. Furthermore, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the resistance of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy is not supported by the data, as the resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 are not functionally redundant. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. However, none of the options perfectly align with this conclusion. Among the given options, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor, even though the other aspects of the option (pleiotropy and epistasis) are not fully supported by the data.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine plants, specifically related to their resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. So, they've done some experiments with knock-out mutants and double mutants and are trying to figure out the gene relationships.

The setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to resistance. They made knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results are the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control. The control has 100% resistance.

Looking at the results:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance to 3/4 of normal.
- g2 has 0% resistance. So, knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance.
- g3 has 50% resistance. Knocking out G3 reduces resistance to half.
- The double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's even lower than either g1 or g3 alone.
   - g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.
   - g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.

Hmm, okay. So, the question is about the interactions between these genes. The options given involve concepts like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

First, I need to recall what each term means.

A transcription factor is a protein that helps regulate the expression of other genes. So, if one of these genes encodes a transcription factor, it would act upstream of other genes, meaning it's involved in regulating their expression.

Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. But in this context, I'm not sure how it applies. Maybe when one gene's function is redundant with another, they might show similar phenotypes when mutated.

Gene redundancy is when two or more genes can perform the same function. So, if knocking out one doesn't cause a problem, but knocking out both does, it suggests redundancy.

Epistasis is when the expression of one gene masks or modifies the expression of another. The gene that's epistatic is downstream; because if you have a mutation in a downstream gene, it can affect the phenotype regardless of the upstream gene's state. So, epistatic genes are downstream, and hypostatic are upstream.

So, the key here is to determine the relationships between G1, G2, and G3 based on their mutant and double mutant phenotypes.

Looking at the resistance levels:

g2 knockout is the most severe, giving 0% resistance. So, G2 seems essential for resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, then its absence would mean that the genes it regulates (maybe G1 and/or G3?) aren't expressed, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out (like in g2g3 or g1g2), the resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because, even if you have a mutation in G1, the presence of a g2 mutation masks it (since both double mutants have 0%). So, the presence of a g2 mutation determines the phenotype regardless of G1 or G3 status.

So, G2 is downstream of the others because its mutation is epistatic. That would mean G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes (since if it's a transcription factor, it's regulating other genes).

Wait, no. Wait. If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream, so it would regulate other genes (like G1 and G3). So, if G2 is knocked out, then the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't be expressed because their regulation is dependent on G2.

So, in the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen. That suggests that either G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3, or that G2 is the key gene responsible for the resistance.

Wait, but the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe G2 is that transcription factor.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then perhaps it activates G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed.

But looking at the data:

In the single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So, when G1 is knocked out, resistance drops to 3/4. So, G1 contributes to resistance, but G2's knockout is worse.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So, G3's knockout reduces resistance more than G1's.

- g2 is 0%, so it's the most severe.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So, even when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is same as g2 alone. So, G1's presence isn't making any difference when G2 is also knocked out. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is not present, G1 can't contribute anything. So, the phenotype is solely determined by G2. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So, G3's function doesn't matter when G2 is knocked out.

What about g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So, knocking out both G1 and G3 together makes things worse than either alone. That suggests that they function in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, their combined effect is additive (or more than additive). So, if G1 and G3 were in the same pathway, you might see a similar phenotype as the more severe single mutant. But here, it's worse, so it's like they're redundant or in separate pathways.

Wait, but if they were redundant, knocking out both would be like knocking out one. But here, when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single, so perhaps they contribute to different parts of the resistance pathway.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So, each provides some resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, perhaps, or maybe they are both downstream of G2.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then it would activate both G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed.

But wait, in the data, the g1 mutant still has some resistance (75%) and g3 mutant has 50%. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are independently contributing, but their expression is only possible when G2 is present.

Wait no, because in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either. So, both contribute to resistance. But when G2 is knocked out, they don't contribute at all. So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So, G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither gene is expressed, leading to 0% resistance, which matches the data.

Now, considering the single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance, which is less than the wild-type. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%. So, G1 contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor.

g3: 50% resistance. So, knocking out G3 reduces resistance by 50%.

So, G3's function is more critical than G1's, perhaps.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since each single mutant (g1 and g3) has 75% and 50% respectively, the combined effect is much worse. So, the two genes must function in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant's resistance would be the same as the most severe single mutant. But here, they're worse when both are knocked out, suggesting they contribute additively.

So, without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So, in the double mutants where both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present (like if any?), but no, in the question, the double mutants are all the possible combinations.

Wait, the double mutants are all the possible combinations of two knocked-out genes. So, the double mutants include g1g2, g1g3, g2g3.

In the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, in that case, since G2 is functional, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, what's the resistance? It's 10%, which is worse than either single (g1 at 75, g3 at 50). Wait, that's confusing. Because if G2 is functional, then why is the resistance so low?

Wait, no. Wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But since G2 is present, what's the resistance? Because G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. If G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2 can't activate them. So, the only resistance comes from other factors. Wait, but in the wild-type, G2 is present and activates G1 and G3, which contribute to resistance.

Hmm, but the g1g3 mutant is when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, even though G2 is present, it can't activate G1 or G3 because those genes are knocked out. So, the resistance would be whatever else is present besides G1 and G3. But if the resistance is 10%, then that's just whatever other factors are contributing.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 and g3 are only partially resistant. So, in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so their contributions are gone. So, the remaining resistance would be from whatever else is present.

But the data shows that the resistance is 10% in g1g3, which is worse than either single mutant. So, the double mutant's phenotype is worse than both single mutants, but not as bad as the triple mutant (which isn't shown, but we can infer).

So, back to the options. The question asks which conclusion about the genes' interactions can be drawn.

Looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the data, G2 is the one with the most severe phenotype. So, if G2 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean that G2 is downstream. So, in g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2. So, this would align with G2 being downstream.

But according to the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, so perhaps G2 is a transcription factor. Then G1 and G3 may be downstream.

But in option A, G1 is the transcription factor, which doesn't match because g1 has 75% resistance, which is less than 100%, but not 0. So, if G1 were a transcription factor, then knocking it out would lead to lower resistance. But it's not as severe as G2's knockout. So, maybe G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter? That would mean they're part of the same operon, which is more common in prokaryotes. In plants, it's less likely. Also, the data for double mutants might not support that. Also, G3 is epistatic towards G1 – so G3 is downstream. But when you knock out G1 and G2, the resistance is 0% (g1g2). So, G2 is epistatic to G1, not G3. Hmm, not sure about this.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy would mean a single gene affecting multiple traits. But the data doesn't indicate that. However, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, perhaps they have other functions. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, so they might not be pleiotropic but rather additive.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make it worse than either. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has resistance of 10%, which is worse than either single, so that suggests that they are not redundant but perhaps additive. So, D's first part might not fit.

Wait, but looking again: if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, their double knockout would have an additive effect, which is what we see (g1g3 is 10% compared to 75% and 50%). So, if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, and when both are knocked out, you lose all their contributions, leading to the 10% resistance. So, G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are not redundant but function in parallel pathways.

So, looking at the options, option C is G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, I don't think that's correct because the data doesn't show any pleiotropic effects. G1 and G3 are each only affecting the resistance trait.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But as I thought earlier, gene redundancy would mean that when both are knocked out, the phenotype is the same as when either is. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than either single. So, they are not redundant, which suggests that D's second point is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: let's think about epistasis in the double mutants.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 has 0% resistance. So, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1.

g2g3 has 0% regardless of G3.

g1g3 has 10% resistance.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effect of G1 or G3.

So, G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3, or is the key gene.

But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, it's upstream, so how can it be epistatic? Because if it's a transcription factor, it's regulating the others. So, if G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 can't be expressed, hence the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3.

So, that's why in the double mutants where G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3 status.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which would mean G2 is downstream. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. Epistasis is when a gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene. So, if G2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then G1 and G3 are downstream. So, in the double mutants, if G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't function because G2 isn't activating them. So, the phenotype is determined by G2's mutation, not G1 or G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But looking at the options, which option says G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic?

Looking at option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. But this option says G1 is a transcription factor, which I don't think fits.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, so that's correct, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3 is downstream of G1.

But in the data, the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either single. So, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant's resistance would be determined by G3's mutation. But g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than both single mutants. That doesn't fit with G3 being epistatic.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy. The data doesn't show that G1 and G3 affect other traits.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because g1g3 is worse than either single, so they are not redundant.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but are not redundant. But I thought redundancy implies that knocking out either doesn't affect the pathway, but knocking out both does.

Hmm.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 may be in parallel pathways. So, each contributes independently to resistance. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is the sum of their individual contributions.

Ah, so in the wild-type, when G2 is present, it activates G1 and G3. Each of these genes contributes to resistance. So, when G1 is knocked out, you lose 25% resistance (75% left). When G3 is knocked out, you lose 50% (50% left). When both are knocked out, you lose 75% + 50% = 125%, but since that's more than 100%, the resistance is 100 - 125% = negative, which isn't possible. So, perhaps it's additive but limited by the maximum.

Wait, but the data shows g1g3 resistance is 10%, which is even worse than either single. So, maybe G1 and G3 are acting in the same pathway, and their combined knockout is worse than either alone. But that doesn't fit with parallel pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps they are in the same pathway, but each contributes a certain amount, and their combined effect is additive. But in that case, the double mutant's resistance would be 25% +50% of control, but that would be 75%? But the data shows 10%. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe another approach: think about whether the genes act in the same pathway or in parallel.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of both, leading to no resistance (as seen in g2, 0%).

In the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, suggesting that each contributes some level to resistance. So, perhaps each gene (G1 and G3) is part of a separate pathway that contributes to the overall resistance. So, G2 activates both, but each gene's product works through a different mechanism.

When you knock out both G1 and G3, you lose both pathways, leading to a much lower resistance (10%). So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance.

Now, looking at the options, which option reflects this?

Looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because I don't see pleiotropy here.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because the double mutant is worse than either single, indicating they're not redundant.

Wait, another thought: in the double mutants, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, perhaps each contributes a part of the resistance. So, in the absence of G2, resistance is zero. But in the absence of G1, you have 25% (so G3 is contributing 75% on its own). Wait, no, because in the single mutant g3, resistance is 50%, not 75%.

Wait, maybe I should model this with numbers.

Let’s imagine that the total resistance is the sum of contributions from G1 and G3.

In the wild-type, G1 contributes X, G3 contributes Y, and perhaps other factors contribute Z.

When G2 is knocked out, X and Y are zero, so resistance is Z, which is 0% as per the data. So, Z is zero, and all resistance comes from G1 and G3.

In the single mutant g1: G1 is knocked out, so resistance is Y (from G3) plus Z. Since in the wild-type, the total is X + Y + Z =100%. But when G2 is knocked out, Z is 0, so X + Y =0? No, because g2 has 0% resistance.

Wait, perhaps the model is that G1 and G3 are the only contributors, and their contributions are additive.

So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are active.

In the wild-type: resistance is G1 + G3 =100%.

In g1: G1 is 0, so G3 = 100% → but data shows g1 has 75% resistance. So that doesn’t fit.

Hmm, perhaps it's a multiplicative model? Or perhaps each gene contributes a certain amount.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each gene as contributing to the same pathway, but in a way that each has a partial effect.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the epistatic relationships.

Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (because the double mutants with G2 knocked out have 0% resistance), G2 must be downstream of both. Wait, no. If G2 is epistatic, that means it's downstream. Because the gene that is epistatic is the one whose mutation masks the effect of the other genes.

Wait, let me think: in the pathway, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then a mutation in B is epistatic to a mutation in A. Because the product of A is upstream, so whether A is functional or not doesn't matter if B isn't functional.

So, for example, if A produces a signal that activates B, and B produces an inhibitor of the pathogen, then a mutation in B (nonfunctional) would lead to susceptibility regardless of A's status.

So, in this case, if G2 is epistatic to G1, that suggests that G2 is downstream of G1.

Wait, but in our case, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which would mean that G2 is downstream of both.

But earlier, we thought that G2 is a transcription factor, which would place it upstream of G1 and G3. That would mean that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, so G2 is not epistatic but rather hypostatic.

Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me think again.

Epistasis is about which gene is upstream or downstream in a pathway. If gene A is upstream of gene B, then a mutation in B (so B is nonfunctional) is epistatic to a mutation in A. Because whether A is functional or not doesn't matter if B isn't working.

So, for example, if A → B → phenotype, then:

- a mutation in A (nonfunctional) can't send the signal to B, so the phenotype is as if B isn't working.

But if B is mutated, the signal from A can't proceed, so the same phenotype.

Wait, no, in that case, a mutation in B would mask the effect of A.

So, in the pathway A → B → C (phenotype), if A is mutated, B doesn't get the signal, so C can't be produced. If B is mutated, same result.

So, in that case, A is upstream of B, but a mutation in B is epistatic to a mutation in A.

So, in that scenario, B is epistatic to A. Because the phenotype of a B mutation is the same as an A mutation, even though A is upstream.

So, applying that here: if G2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then G1 and G3 are downstream. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%, same as when G1 and G2 are both knocked out (g1g2). So, the presence of a G2 knockout masks the effect of G1.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1. But G2 is upstream, so how does that work?

Wait, perhaps because G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So, in the double mutant g1g2, G1 is not expressed because G2 is knocked out. So, the phenotype is the same as g2.

Similarly, in the g2g3 mutant, G3 isn't expressed because G2 is knocked out, so phenotype is same as g2.

So, in that case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because the presence of a G2 mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But in the pathway, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. So, how does that reconcile with the concept of epistasis?

Ah, perhaps it's because G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 can't function regardless of their own status. So, in the double mutants, the presence of G2's mutation determines the phenotype.

So, G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Doesn't fit because we think G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

No, the same promoter is unlikely. Also, G3 isn't epistatic.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because G1 isn't epistatic; G2 is.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because there's no redundancy.

Wait, none of the options perfectly fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2 being epistatic would suggest it is downstream, but if G1 is the TF, that might not fit.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter is unlikely. Also, G3 is epistatic, which would mean G3 is downstream. But when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So, perhaps G3 is more critical.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy isn't evident. Epistasis here would say G1 is downstream of G3, which doesn't fit our data.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because gene redundancy isn't supported.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not seeing why. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, which suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, their functions are additive. So, in the presence of G2, knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to very low resistance.

Which would suggest that G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in separate pathways. Thus, they don't show redundancy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function in a way that their combined knockout is worse than either. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which of the options correctly describes the epistatic relationships?

We know that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option says G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to others?

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, only G2 is epistatic to G1, not to G3.

But our data shows that G2 is epistatic to both.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3 is downstream of G1.

But our data doesn't show that. Because the g1g3 double mutant has 10%, which is worse than either single.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A? Let me think again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G1 is the transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, more severe than G1's 75%. So, if G1 were a TF, then knocking it out would reduce resistance more than G2's knockout. But it's the opposite.

So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's try to find the conclusion.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout is the most severe, and it's epistatic to G1 and G3. So, the correct option should have G2 as TF and G2 being epistatic.

So, looking again:

Option A: no, G1 as TF.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 epistatic towards G1.

But our data shows G2 is epistatic towards both.

So, none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, the options are:

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I don't see any evidence of pleiotropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, in option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So, perhaps they are co-regulated by G2. So, when G2 is knocked out, both are not expressed. But in the single mutants, each shows some resistance, so that must come from the other.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are under the same promoter, they are co-regulated. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither is expressed. But in the single mutants, each is expressed.

But the data for the double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is much lower than either single. So, that supports that they're in separate pathways.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, so their combined knockout leads to additive effects. So, they are not redundant, but their functions are additive.

Looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy.

No, I don't think so.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because they’re not redundant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but G1 is epistatic to G3. That would mean G1 is downstream of G3. But when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, and G3's knockout is 50%, which suggests that G1's effect is stronger. So, if G1 is downstream, then G3 is upstream. But the double mutant would have the same resistance as G1 knockout. But in the data, the double mutant is worse.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to restate the data in terms of epistasis.

G2's mutation masks the effects of G1 and G3. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, in the pathway, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3? Or upstream?

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, it's upstream, regulating G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream, but when it's knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. So, in that case, the mutation in G2 (upstream) masks (is epistatic to) the mutations in G1 and G3 (downstream). But that's counter to what I thought earlier.

Wait, usually, the gene that is epistatic is the one downstream. Because when a downstream gene is mutated, the upstream genes' effects can't be felt.

So, if G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then mutations in G1 or G3 (downstream) would be epistatic to G2's mutations.

But in our data, when G2 is mutated, the phenotype is 0%, regardless of G1 or G3. So, that would mean G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which suggests that G2 is downstream.

But that's conflicting with G2 being a transcription factor.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor and is downstream. That doesn't make sense because transcription factors are usually upstream.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The only option where G2 is a transcription factor is option B and C.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, that means they're co-regulated. So, knocking out G2 would prevent both from being expressed. But in the single mutants, they have some resistance, so they must be expressed when G2 is present.

But the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. If G1 and G3 are co-regulated, then knocking out both (g1g3) would have the same effect as knocking out G2, but the data shows 10%, not 0%. So, there's something else contributing.

Hmm. Maybe this is pointing me towards option C.

Wait, option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, G1 is downstream of G3. So, the phenotype of G1's mutation would mask G3's.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single, which doesn't fit with epistasis. Because if G1 is downstream, then a mutation in G1 would mask G3's effect, and g1g3 should have the same resistance as g1.

But data shows g1g3 is worse than g1, so that can't be.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of each possibility.

If G2 is a transcription factor (so upstream), then in the double mutants where G2 is present (like g1g3), G2 is active. So, G1 and G3 are expressed. But in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out. So, their products are not present. So, the resistance is 10%, which must be due to other factors.

Hmm, but the data indicates that when G2 is not knocked out, the double mutant's resistance is worse than either single. So, in the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, G2 is a transcription factor, so it can activate other genes. But if G1 and G3 are the only downstream genes involved in resistance, then knocking them both would lead to loss of resistance. But in the data, the resistance is 10%, which suggests that some other factors are contributing.

Alternatively, maybe G2's function is to activate G1 and G3, and when both are knocked out, the remaining resistance is due to other, non-G2 pathways.

Wait, but in the wild-type, G2 is necessary for G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't contribute. So, their contribution is zero, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are active. So, why is the resistance only 10%?

Ah, perhaps because G1 and G3 are not the only contributors. There are other genes contributing to resistance as well, which are not regulated by G2.

In that case, the g1g3 mutant would lose the contributions from G1 and G3, but retain some resistance from other genes, hence 10%.

So, G2's role is to regulate G1 and G3, but the total resistance comes from other genes as well. But when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't contribute, but the other genes might also be affected.

Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, so all resistance comes through G2.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Let me think about epistasis again.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% when G2 is functional. So, G1 and G3 contribute 90% of the resistance when both are functional. That means that their combined effect is additive, not redundant.

So, when both are knocked out, resistance drops from 100% to 10%. So, each provides about 85% (but not exactly, since 75% +50% =125%, but the total is 100%). So, perhaps additive.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, their combined knockout leads to the sum of their contributions being lost, leading to 10% resistance.

So, in this scenario, G2 is a transcription factor regulating both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Now, looking back at the options, which says G2 is a transcription factor, and that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (not showing redundancy, not showing pleiotropy).

So, the correct option must have G2 as TF, and G1 and G3 not showing redundancy but their combined effect is additive (so resistance is lower than either single).

Looking at the options:

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because no pleiotropy.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because they don't show redundancy.

Wait, but maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the correct answer is option A: G1 is a transcription factor. No, because G2's knockout is worse.

Hmm, I think I have to make a choice here. Based on the data that G2's knockout is the most severe and epistatic to both G1 and G3, the correct option must have G2 as the transcription factor and G2 being epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic towards G1. So, G3 is downstream of G1. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than either, so G3 isn't epistatic.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. No, because no pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. No, because they aren't redundant.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me rethink the epistatic relationships.

If G2 is a transcription factor, which is necessary for G1 and G3, then:

- In g2: G1 and G3 are not expressed → resistance 0%.
- In g1: G1 is not expressed, but G2 and G3 are → resistance 75%.
- In g3: G3 not expressed, G1 and G2 are → resistance 50%.

So, G2 is necessary for G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g2: G1 and G2 are not expressed → G3 is expressed (since G2 is not required for G3's expression in this model. Wait, no, because G2 is the TF for both. So, in g1g2, G2 is knocked out, so G3 isn't expressed. So, resistance is 0%.

Ah, so in this model, G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But G2 is functional, so G2 can activate other genes. Wait, but in this case, G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, so knocking out G1 and G3 doesn't affect G2's ability to function elsewhere. So, perhaps G2 has other targets.

But in the data, the resistance is 10% in g1g3, which suggests that other genes besides G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their expression isn't affected by G1 or G3's knockout.

So, back to the options.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, G1 is downstream. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which is not consistent with G1 being epistatic.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. Thus, their combined knockout leads to additive effects, making the resistance worse than either single.

So, which option reflects this?

Looking at the options, perhaps none of them explicitly state this. But among the options given, the most plausible one is option C or D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, the options are confusing. Another approach: look for the epistatic relationships.

Which gene's mutation masks the effect of another?

In the data, when G2 is mutated, the effect of G1 and G3 is masked. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2 is downstream.

But earlier, we thought G2 is a transcription factor, which is upstream. So, this seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that is downstream of G1 and G3. But that doesn't make sense because transcription factors are usually upstream.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I think I'm stuck and need to choose the best possible option.

The correct answer is option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I don’t see how G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. They each contribute to resistance, but pleiotropy refers to affecting multiple traits, which isn't indicated here.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not confident. Based on the data, G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, looking for an option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic.

In the options, option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1, which doesn't fit.

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, but not towards G3.

Wait, in the data, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So, the correct option must have G2 being epistatic to both.

So, looking for an option where G2 is a TF and is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But none of the options directly state that.

Wait, option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because G2 is epistatic to both.

I think I've gone in circles and need to make a decision. Based on the data, G2 is the key gene, acting as a TF, and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, the correct option would have G2 as TF, and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, the only one that has G2 as TF is B, C, and D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Which would mean that G1 is downstream. But the data for g1g3 shows worse resistance than either, which doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Their combined knockout leads to additive effects. So, which option reflects this?

The only option where G2 is a TF is B, C, and D.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But they don't because their combined knockout is worse than either single.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. I think the correct answer is option A is wrong because G2 is the TF.

Maybe I should think of this as a pathway where G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

In that case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, the correct option would have G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, only option A says G2 is epistatic to G1, but not G3.

So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options correctly fit, but that can't be.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with option C despite doubts. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: in the double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2 is downstream.

But earlier, we thought G2 is a transcription factor, which is upstream.

This is a contradiction. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has G1 as a TF. But that doesn't fit with G2's knockout being the most severe.

I think I'm stuck. I'll take a guess and say the correct answer is option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Maybe the correct answer is option B.

Wait, option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which would mean they're co-regulated. If they're both knocked out, but G2 is functional, then their contributions are gone, leading to lower resistance. So, in the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. But if they're co-regulated by G2, then in the single mutants, each would have some resistance. So, option B could fit.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll conclude with option C.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes, G1, G2, and G3, based on their contributions to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine plants. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and relationships.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (loss of G1 reduces resistance by 25%).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (loss of G3 reduces resistance by 50%).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

3. **Epistasis**:
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the presence of a g2 mutation masks the effects of G1 and G3 mutations.
   - The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, likely through separate pathways.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent because G2 is the most severe mutant (0% resistance), and there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data.
  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. The idea of G1 and G3 sharing the same promoter is unlikely, as the double mutant g1g3 shows resistance (10%), indicating that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant or co-regulated. Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the resistance of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, there is no evidence of pleiotropy in the data. Furthermore, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the resistance of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy is not supported by the data, as the resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 are not functionally redundant. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. However, none of the options perfectly align with this conclusion. Among the given options, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor, even though the other aspects of the option (pleiotropy and epistasis) are not fully supported by the data.
