Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbaldehyde group (which is a CHO group) and another substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, I think that's a substituent where a methyl group is attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has a hydroxyl group.

Wait, no, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to the main cyclohexane. Or maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl that also has an -OH group. Let me draw this mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. One substituent is the carbaldehyde (CHO) group. The other substituent is a methyl group that's connected to a cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is [cyclohexane]-CHO and [cyclohexyl-(CH(OH)CH2-)] attached to the same carbon? Or maybe the methyl is between the cyclohexyl and the hydroxyl. I think the correct structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group all attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So probably, it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main ring. So the main ring has two substituents: a CHO group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the aldehyde, I think. So the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to that carbon.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has both the aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, that carbon has three substituents: CHO, OH, and cyclohexyl. Wait, but that might not be possible because of valency. Oh wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH, the other by cyclohexyl, and then attached to the aldehyde. Like, the main ring has a CH2 group attached, and that CH2 is connected to both the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. No, wait, if it's (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), the methyl group (CH2-) is attached to the main ring. On that methyl group, one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl, and the other by a cyclohexyl. So the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), but on a cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the starting material and the reagents to figure out the reaction steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

The goal is to add substituents to this structure to get the target molecule. Let's think about the possible reactions step by step.

Looking at the options, each option gives a sequence of four reagents. Let me think about what each reagent does.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Hmm, so I'm trying to figure out what each step does.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine the structure: cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

The target has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the first step is to functionalize that triple bond.

NaNH2 and methyl chloride: that sounds like an alkylation reaction. NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate things, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So in the presence of a strong base, perhaps an alkyne (which is sp-hybridized) can undergo alkylation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Deprotonating it with a strong base like NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide (the deprotonated alkyne), which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) for alkylation. That would add a methyl group to the alkyne. So, cyclohexenide + CH3Cl → cyclohexylidene with a methyl group attached. So, the alkyne becomes CH2CH2? No, wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-H. Deprotonating the acidic proton (which is at the end) gives a -C≡C- - with a negative charge. Then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. Wait, but NaNH2 is used in deprotonation and alkylation of terminal alkynes to form longer alkynes. So the product would be a longer alkyne. Wait, in this case, starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), after deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride, would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, no. The starting alkyne is CH2-C≡CH (but connected to the cyclohexane). Wait, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡CH? Hmm, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so I think it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

So, deprotonating with NaNH2 would give cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would act as an alkylating agent, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, that can't be right. Wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. The alkyne's deprotonated end would attack the methyl chloride, so the alkyne would have a methyl group added: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So the product would be 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne? Or perhaps 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation of the alkyne would lead to a longer alkyne. So, the first step would add a methyl group, turning the alkyne into a longer one.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. When treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), it deprotonates to form the cyclohexylacetylide ion (cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na+). Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with this acetylide in an alkylation, adding a methyl group. So the product would have an additional methyl group on the triple bond. So, the triple bond would become CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or perhaps CH2-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, the cyclohexane is attached to the triple bond as -C≡CH. After deprotonation and alkylation, the triple bond would have a methyl group added, so it would become CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, that would make it a propyne group. So the structure after step 1 would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, perhaps after alkylation, the product is 1-cyclohexylpropyne (cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3). Or maybe 3-cyclohexylpropyne? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making it a longer chain. So, the triple bond would now be between two carbons, each with their substituents.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to perform a deprotonation and alkylation to make a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated. Looking at the options, the second reagent in option A is H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. Similarly, option C's second reagent is H2 and Pd with CaCO3, which is probably hydrogenation as well.

So, after step 1 (alkylation), step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, i.e., the alkyne becomes an alkane. Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, it would become cis-alkene. Without a catalyst, maybe it goes all the way to alkane. Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups.

Wait, but in option A, after alkylation, step 2 is H2/Pd, which probably hydrogenates the triple bond. So, if the alkyne becomes a single bond, that would form a cyclohexyl group attached to a longer chain.

Wait, but let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is also attached to a cyclohexane ring that has a CHO group. Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a cyclohexyl group with some additional substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated to add a methyl group, then hydrogenated to a single bond, leading to a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde group. Wait, how would that happen?

Another approach is to think about the target molecule. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group. Wait, no, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the main ring, which also has an aldehyde group. So the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring's carbon that also has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group, where one H is replaced by OH and the other by cyclohexyl. So, it's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring, which also has a CHO group.

So, how can I get from ethynylcyclohexane to that structure?

Let me think about the steps. 

First, perhaps I need to add a methyl group to the alkyne to make it a longer chain. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Then, perform some oxidation or addition to introduce the hydroxyl group and the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is being converted into an epoxide, but that seems unrelated. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being functionalized into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to form a more substituted alkyne, then reduce it to an alkene, and then perform some addition or oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is being converted into a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, oxidation of alkynes can lead to different products. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne can produce diketones. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used perhaps for elimination. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in aqueous conditions are for acid-catalyzed reactions, perhaps sulfonation or oxidation?

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2, ethyl chloride; step 2 is Li/NH3; step 3 is O3 and H2O; step 4 is NH4OH.

Li/NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonations, maybe for elimination or alkylation. O3 and H2O is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. NH4OH is a mild acid used to work up ozonolysis.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-CaCO3; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/NH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Hmm, let's think about each step.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

Step 1 in all options is NaNH2 and some alkyl chloride.

Wait, but in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but perhaps it's for forming methyl ethers, but I'm not certain.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating acidic protons, like those in terminal alkynes. So, the first step in each option is to deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate.

In option A, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, so the acetylide would react with CH3Cl to form a longer alkyne. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would reduce it to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, the alkyne after step 1 is longer. Let me think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), after alkylation with CH3Cl, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to a single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reduction of the alkyne. The alkyne (after step 1) is (cyclohexyl)propyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3). When hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, it would become (cyclohexyl)propane. Which would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the target molecule has a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde. So, the next steps must introduce those groups.

Looking at step 3 in option A: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions. Maybe it's used to form a double bond? Or perhaps for epoxidation, but more likely elimination.

Then, step 4 in option A: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Hock rearrangement or some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxidation of alcohols, perhaps forming ketones or other groups. Alternatively, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is an elimination to form a double bond, and step 4 is some kind of oxidation.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and what they could achieve.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, which would add an ethyl group to the alkyne. So the alkyne becomes longer, perhaps to form a 1-ethyl-1-cyclohexylethyne. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a very strong base, used for elimination reactions, such as the formation of alkenes via deprotonation and elimination (like the Birch reduction or elimination in ketones). Alternatively, it could be used for alkylation. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild acid to work up ozonolysis.

Wait, but how would that produce the desired structure? Maybe after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then step 2 could form a double bond. Ozonolysis would then cleave that double bond into carbonyls. But then the product would have carbonyl groups, which might correspond to the aldehyde and other groups in the target molecule.

Option C: Step 1 is same as A, alkylation with methyl chloride to make a longer alkyne. Step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. That's similar to option A's step 2. So the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, giving aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or saponification.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests an alcohol. How would that form?

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol is a methylating agent, but usually methyl chloride is used. Methanol might not be a good methylating agent under such conditions. Maybe it's used for something else, like forming ethers. But perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol in a different way. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a strong base. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a milder work-up that leads to aldehydes and ketones but not ozonides. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which is acidic work-up.

Wait, but how would that lead to the target molecule?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group, a cyclohexyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon on the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group all attached to the same carbon.

Wait, that would be a central carbon attached to three groups: cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and aldehyde. But that's not possible for a carbon because it can't have four bonds. Oh wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH, another by cyclohexyl, and the third is connected to the main ring, which also has the aldehyde.

Wait, actually, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, it's a methyl group attached to the main ring, which is further attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), attached to the main ring. The main ring also has a CHO group attached to the same carbon as the substituent.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with a carbon that has substituents: CHO, CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and two more CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the substituent as a CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH group attached to the main ring, with substituents cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and the other bond connected to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group on the same carbon. So, that carbon would have three substituents: CHO, OH, cyclohexyl, and the ring. But that's four bonds, which isn't possible. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group, where one hydrogen is replaced by OH, another by cyclohexyl, and the other is attached to the main ring which also has the CHO group. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), attached to the main ring, which also has a CHO on that same carbon. So, the main ring's carbon is connected to CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) and a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think about that.

Let me think about the process:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

Step 1: Alkylation to add a methyl group, making it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't get me anywhere near the target molecule. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the alkyne isn't being hydrogenated all the way. Another possibility is that the alkyne is being converted into an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being functionalized to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. But I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Looking back at the options, option D uses methanol in step 1, which might not be the best for alkylation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a Grignard reagent, but I don't see Mg in any of the reagents, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, another possibility: when the alkyne is hydrogenated, it forms a cis-alkene, not an alkane, depending on the catalyst. For example, with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, the alkyne becomes a cis-alkene. But in option A and C, the catalyst is Pd, which might fully hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule's formation steps.

The target molecule has a CHO group. How can I form a CHO group from an alkyne?

One way is to perform an oxidation of an alkyne to an aldehyde. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne can give a diketone, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, oxidation of a propargyl alcohol can give an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the process involves making a propargyl alcohol first, then oxidizing it to an aldehyde. But how would that happen?

Let me try to outline a possible synthesis path:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. The alkyne is then hydrogenated to form a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs to form a double bond, which is then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some reaction, then further modified.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol, which can be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I don't see Mg in the reagents, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent, but I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Wait, I remember that ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones. So, if the alkyne is ozonolyzed, it would break into two carbonyl groups.

But in the target molecule, we have an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group, so maybe ozonolysis is involved in forming the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: alkylates the alkyne to make a longer alkyne, say ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)ethynyl-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3: a strong base, perhaps for elimination. If the alkyne is converted into an alkene via elimination, but with what?

Wait, maybe after alkylation, the alkyne is converted into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used for a coupling reaction or for forming a stronger base.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis of any double bonds. So if the previous step formed a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: work-up, perhaps to form aldehydes/ketones.

But I'm not sure how this would produce the target molecule.

Alternatively, let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as a hydroxymethyl and aldehyde group. So that suggests that the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring's carbon, which also has the aldehyde.

So, perhaps that substituent is formed via an elimination reaction, such as the formation of a double bond followed by some addition.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a cis-alkene, then epoxidized, then opened to form an alcohol. But I don't see an epoxidation step in the options.

Hmm. Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to the main ring. But that doesn't align with the name given.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So, the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring, which also has a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then into an alcohol, then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then perhaps further modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized into a propargyl alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 adds a methyl group via alkylation, making cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd. This would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's just a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane. How does that help form the substituent with the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups?

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but in this case, after step 2, there are no double bonds. So maybe the product after step 2 is a single bond, which wouldn't react with ozone. So this doesn't seem right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Perhaps step 2 in option C is a different kind of hydrogenation. Wait, H2 and Pd-CaCO3 is probably a catalyst for hydrogenation, similar to Lindlar's but maybe for full hydrogenation. So the alkyne becomes a single bond, as before.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis, but without any double bonds, that wouldn't do anything. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2, methanol. Wait, methanol is a weaker methylating agent compared to methyl chloride. Maybe this step doesn't alkylate the alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's for some other purpose, like forming an ether. But I'm not sure. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up. Then step 4 is NH4OH.

Hmm, but without a clear pathway, I'm not sure.

Option B's steps: step 1 is alkylation with ethyl chloride, making a longer alkyne. Step 2 is Li/NH3, which might deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyls. Then, NH4OH would work up the ozonide into aldehydes or ketones.

So, let me imagine the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated with ethyl chloride to become (cyclohexyl)ethynyl-CH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Alkylation of the acetylide would add an ethyl group, making the alkyne longer.

Wait, after step 1, the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added. So, it becomes (cyclohexyl)ethynyl-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe this deprotonates and eliminates, forming a double bond. So, the alkyne would convert into an alkene. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via some elimination.

Wait, but the alkyne is already an alkyne. How would Li/NH3 affect it? Maybe it's used for deprotonation and elimination to form a more substituted alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond.

Wait, but that would require eliminating a small molecule. Perhaps the Li/NH3 is used to deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, causing the alkyne to form an alkene via elimination.

But I'm not certain about that.

Assuming that happens, the alkyne becomes an alkene. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, if you have a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2-CH2-CH2 group (from the alkylation and elimination), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. But how would that form the substituent with the cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and aldehyde groups?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces an aldehyde and a ketone, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Option D's steps: step 1 uses NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this step is for acetylide formation, but methanol isn't a good alkylating agent. Or perhaps it's for forming an ether. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which could be for elimination, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave that, and step 4 is NH4OH to work up.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to think of the target molecule's formation.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring that also has a CHO group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. Then, the aldehyde could undergo a reaction to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized again. But I don't see any oxidizing agents in the options except for Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 with HgSO4.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some reaction to form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde. But again, I'm not sure how the reagents would achieve that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a propyl chain, which is then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's say after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then ozonolysis would require a double bond. So perhaps a double bond is formed before ozonolysis.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each step and what each reagent does.

Looking at option D again:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate terminal alkynes. Methanol is a methylating agent, but NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne, making the acetylide. Then, methanol might react with the acetylide. Acetylide + CH3OH → CH3O-... No, wait, the acetylide would react with an alkyl halide, but methanol is not an alkyl halide. So maybe in this case, the acetylide would take a methyl group from methanol? Unlikely, since methanol is a poor methylating agent without a good leaving group. So perhaps step 1 in option D doesn't alkylate the alkyne but does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 and methanol are used for deprotonation and something else, like converting the alkyne into a different functional group. But I'm not sure.

Step 2 in option D is Li/NH3. Lithium and ammonia are used for elimination reactions or for Birch reductions. Maybe it's used to reduce the alkyne to a trans-alkene. But I'm not certain.

Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if step 2 formed a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is used to work up ozonolysis, typically to prevent over-oxidation and to form aldehydes/ketones.

Putting it together:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methanol. Not sure, but perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, but methanol doesn't alkylate.

2. Then treated with Li/NH3, which may cause elimination, forming a double bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up with NH4OH would give aldehydes or ketones.

But how does this lead to the target molecule with the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups?

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is an aldehyde, which is attached to the main ring, and the other is a ketone that is further modified.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a diol, which is then oxidized. But I don't see any diol-forming steps.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think about the correct answer and what each step achieves.

The correct answer is likely option C or D. But I need to narrow it down.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. How can I form an aldehyde from an alkyne? One way is via ozonolysis of an alkyne, but that typically gives diketones. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, maybe the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a propyl chain.

3. Ozonolysis to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to acid-catalyzed hydration to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, hydration of an alkene with acid can form a carbonyl. So, if after hydrogenation, the alkene is formed, then hydration would give a ketone or aldehyde.

But in option A, after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, so that's not applicable.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. That suggests that a cyclohexyl group is added to a secondary alcohol. How can that happen?

Perhaps through a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Mg in the reagents. Alternatively, perhaps through some addition reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkene, which is then subjected to a cyclopropanation or some addition to bring in the cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a longer chain, then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a propargyl group, which is then hydrogenated to a propyl group. Then, oxidation at the end of the chain forms an aldehyde.

But I don't see any oxidizing agents in the steps except for H2SO4 in option A.

Wait, in option A, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Hock rearrangement or a sulfonation followed by oxidation. HgSO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. So perhaps this step is an oxidation.

Putting it all together, perhaps:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

Step 2: hydrogenated to form a longer alkane.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination to form a double bond.

Step 4: H2SO4 and HgSO4 oxidize the double bond or the alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then treated with Ba(OH)2 to form a ketone via oxidation.

I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the steps.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps ozonolysis is involved. Ozonolysis of a double bond would form carbonyl groups.

Looking at option B: after ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH, which would form aldehydes.

So, perhaps in option B, after forming a double bond, ozonolysis cleaves it into two aldehydes, which are attached to the cyclohexane.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to form a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form an aldehyde and another carbonyl.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde.

But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has the aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, which is attached to a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

- Hydrogenation to form a primary alcohol.

- Oxidation of the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I don't see a step for oxidation to aldehyde in the options. Wait, in option A, step 4 is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which could oxidize an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation.

Step 2: Hydrogenation to form a chain with an alcohol.

Step 3: Base treatment to eliminate and form a double bond.

Step 4: Oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Overall, I'm not entirely confident, but I think option D is not correct because it uses methanol for alkylation, which doesn't make sense. Option A's steps might involve forming an aldehyde via oxidation, but I'm not fully certain.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the CHO group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a coupling reaction, but I don't see any coupling reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a benzyl-type group, which can then undergo some ring-opening or addition.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think:

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation with H2/Pd-CaCO3 to form a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S to form carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2, a strong base.

Wait, ozonolysis of a single bond wouldn't do anything. So perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, but then that single bond is treated with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond from a vicinal diol or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond for ozonolysis.

Wait, if step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, maybe it's a partial hydrogenation, stopping at the alkene. Then, step 3 would ozonolyze the double bond into carbonyls. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a base, perhaps for elimination or saponification.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

I think I've spent a lot of time trying to figure this out, but I'm not entirely confident. Based on the options and the steps, I'll go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent containing a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group all attached to the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to form a longer alkyne (e.g., cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ structure.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could promote elimination or other reactions, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: These reagents suggest oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding an ethyl group to form a longer alkyne (e.g., cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could deprotonate and eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: This mild acid could work up the ozonolysis products. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups are introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to form a longer alkyne (e.g., cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: This step likely hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ structure.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up could cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, the product after step 2 does not have a double bond, so this step’s role is unclear.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could promote elimination or other reactions, but its contribution to forming the target molecule is uncertain.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Methanol is not an efficient alkylating agent, so this step likely does not alkylate the alkyne. Its purpose is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could deprotonate and eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: This mild acid could work up the ozonolysis products. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups are introduced.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most plausible sequence. It involves alkylation of the terminal alkyne, hydrogenation to form a single bond, ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups, and use of Ba(OH)₂ for further reactions. While the exact mechanism is unclear, this sequence aligns most closely with the transformations needed to form the target molecule.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbaldehyde group (which is a CHO group) and another substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, I think that's a substituent where a methyl group is attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has a hydroxyl group.

Wait, no, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to the main cyclohexane. Or maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl that also has an -OH group. Let me draw this mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. One substituent is the carbaldehyde (CHO) group. The other substituent is a methyl group that's connected to a cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is [cyclohexane]-CHO and [cyclohexyl-(CH(OH)CH2-)] attached to the same carbon? Or maybe the methyl is between the cyclohexyl and the hydroxyl. I think the correct structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group all attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So probably, it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main ring. So the main ring has two substituents: a CHO group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the aldehyde, I think. So the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to that carbon.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has both the aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, that carbon has three substituents: CHO, OH, and cyclohexyl. Wait, but that might not be possible because of valency. Oh wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH, the other by cyclohexyl, and then attached to the aldehyde. Like, the main ring has a CH2 group attached, and that CH2 is connected to both the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. No, wait, if it's (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), the methyl group (CH2-) is attached to the main ring. On that methyl group, one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl, and the other by a cyclohexyl. So the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), but on a cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the starting material and the reagents to figure out the reaction steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

The goal is to add substituents to this structure to get the target molecule. Let's think about the possible reactions step by step.

Looking at the options, each option gives a sequence of four reagents. Let me think about what each reagent does.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Hmm, so I'm trying to figure out what each step does.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine the structure: cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

The target has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the first step is to functionalize that triple bond.

NaNH2 and methyl chloride: that sounds like an alkylation reaction. NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate things, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So in the presence of a strong base, perhaps an alkyne (which is sp-hybridized) can undergo alkylation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Deprotonating it with a strong base like NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide (the deprotonated alkyne), which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) for alkylation. That would add a methyl group to the alkyne. So, cyclohexenide + CH3Cl → cyclohexylidene with a methyl group attached. So, the alkyne becomes CH2CH2? No, wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-H. Deprotonating the acidic proton (which is at the end) gives a -C≡C- - with a negative charge. Then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. Wait, but NaNH2 is used in deprotonation and alkylation of terminal alkynes to form longer alkynes. So the product would be a longer alkyne. Wait, in this case, starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), after deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride, would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, no. The starting alkyne is CH2-C≡CH (but connected to the cyclohexane). Wait, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡CH? Hmm, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so I think it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

So, deprotonating with NaNH2 would give cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would act as an alkylating agent, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, that can't be right. Wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. The alkyne's deprotonated end would attack the methyl chloride, so the alkyne would have a methyl group added: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So the product would be 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne? Or perhaps 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation of the alkyne would lead to a longer alkyne. So, the first step would add a methyl group, turning the alkyne into a longer one.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. When treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), it deprotonates to form the cyclohexylacetylide ion (cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na+). Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with this acetylide in an alkylation, adding a methyl group. So the product would have an additional methyl group on the triple bond. So, the triple bond would become CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or perhaps CH2-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, the cyclohexane is attached to the triple bond as -C≡CH. After deprotonation and alkylation, the triple bond would have a methyl group added, so it would become CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, that would make it a propyne group. So the structure after step 1 would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, perhaps after alkylation, the product is 1-cyclohexylpropyne (cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3). Or maybe 3-cyclohexylpropyne? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making it a longer chain. So, the triple bond would now be between two carbons, each with their substituents.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to perform a deprotonation and alkylation to make a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated. Looking at the options, the second reagent in option A is H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. Similarly, option C's second reagent is H2 and Pd with CaCO3, which is probably hydrogenation as well.

So, after step 1 (alkylation), step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, i.e., the alkyne becomes an alkane. Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, it would become cis-alkene. Without a catalyst, maybe it goes all the way to alkane. Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups.

Wait, but in option A, after alkylation, step 2 is H2/Pd, which probably hydrogenates the triple bond. So, if the alkyne becomes a single bond, that would form a cyclohexyl group attached to a longer chain.

Wait, but let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is also attached to a cyclohexane ring that has a CHO group. Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a cyclohexyl group with some additional substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated to add a methyl group, then hydrogenated to a single bond, leading to a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde group. Wait, how would that happen?

Another approach is to think about the target molecule. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group. Wait, no, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the main ring, which also has an aldehyde group. So the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring's carbon that also has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group, where one H is replaced by OH and the other by cyclohexyl. So, it's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring, which also has a CHO group.

So, how can I get from ethynylcyclohexane to that structure?

Let me think about the steps. 

First, perhaps I need to add a methyl group to the alkyne to make it a longer chain. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Then, perform some oxidation or addition to introduce the hydroxyl group and the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is being converted into an epoxide, but that seems unrelated. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being functionalized into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to form a more substituted alkyne, then reduce it to an alkene, and then perform some addition or oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is being converted into a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, oxidation of alkynes can lead to different products. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne can produce diketones. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used perhaps for elimination. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in aqueous conditions are for acid-catalyzed reactions, perhaps sulfonation or oxidation?

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2, ethyl chloride; step 2 is Li/NH3; step 3 is O3 and H2O; step 4 is NH4OH.

Li/NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonations, maybe for elimination or alkylation. O3 and H2O is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. NH4OH is a mild acid used to work up ozonolysis.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-CaCO3; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/NH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Hmm, let's think about each step.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

Step 1 in all options is NaNH2 and some alkyl chloride.

Wait, but in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but perhaps it's for forming methyl ethers, but I'm not certain.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating acidic protons, like those in terminal alkynes. So, the first step in each option is to deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate.

In option A, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, so the acetylide would react with CH3Cl to form a longer alkyne. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would reduce it to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, the alkyne after step 1 is longer. Let me think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), after alkylation with CH3Cl, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to a single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reduction of the alkyne. The alkyne (after step 1) is (cyclohexyl)propyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3). When hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, it would become (cyclohexyl)propane. Which would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the target molecule has a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde. So, the next steps must introduce those groups.

Looking at step 3 in option A: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions. Maybe it's used to form a double bond? Or perhaps for epoxidation, but more likely elimination.

Then, step 4 in option A: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Hock rearrangement or some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxidation of alcohols, perhaps forming ketones or other groups. Alternatively, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is an elimination to form a double bond, and step 4 is some kind of oxidation.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and what they could achieve.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, which would add an ethyl group to the alkyne. So the alkyne becomes longer, perhaps to form a 1-ethyl-1-cyclohexylethyne. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a very strong base, used for elimination reactions, such as the formation of alkenes via deprotonation and elimination (like the Birch reduction or elimination in ketones). Alternatively, it could be used for alkylation. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild acid to work up ozonolysis.

Wait, but how would that produce the desired structure? Maybe after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then step 2 could form a double bond. Ozonolysis would then cleave that double bond into carbonyls. But then the product would have carbonyl groups, which might correspond to the aldehyde and other groups in the target molecule.

Option C: Step 1 is same as A, alkylation with methyl chloride to make a longer alkyne. Step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. That's similar to option A's step 2. So the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, giving aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or saponification.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests an alcohol. How would that form?

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol is a methylating agent, but usually methyl chloride is used. Methanol might not be a good methylating agent under such conditions. Maybe it's used for something else, like forming ethers. But perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol in a different way. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a strong base. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a milder work-up that leads to aldehydes and ketones but not ozonides. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which is acidic work-up.

Wait, but how would that lead to the target molecule?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group, a cyclohexyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon on the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group all attached to the same carbon.

Wait, that would be a central carbon attached to three groups: cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and aldehyde. But that's not possible for a carbon because it can't have four bonds. Oh wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH, another by cyclohexyl, and the third is connected to the main ring, which also has the aldehyde.

Wait, actually, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, it's a methyl group attached to the main ring, which is further attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), attached to the main ring. The main ring also has a CHO group attached to the same carbon as the substituent.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with a carbon that has substituents: CHO, CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and two more CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the substituent as a CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH group attached to the main ring, with substituents cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and the other bond connected to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group on the same carbon. So, that carbon would have three substituents: CHO, OH, cyclohexyl, and the ring. But that's four bonds, which isn't possible. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group, where one hydrogen is replaced by OH, another by cyclohexyl, and the other is attached to the main ring which also has the CHO group. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), attached to the main ring, which also has a CHO on that same carbon. So, the main ring's carbon is connected to CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) and a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think about that.

Let me think about the process:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

Step 1: Alkylation to add a methyl group, making it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't get me anywhere near the target molecule. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the alkyne isn't being hydrogenated all the way. Another possibility is that the alkyne is being converted into an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being functionalized to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. But I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Looking back at the options, option D uses methanol in step 1, which might not be the best for alkylation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a Grignard reagent, but I don't see Mg in any of the reagents, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, another possibility: when the alkyne is hydrogenated, it forms a cis-alkene, not an alkane, depending on the catalyst. For example, with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, the alkyne becomes a cis-alkene. But in option A and C, the catalyst is Pd, which might fully hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule's formation steps.

The target molecule has a CHO group. How can I form a CHO group from an alkyne?

One way is to perform an oxidation of an alkyne to an aldehyde. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne can give a diketone, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, oxidation of a propargyl alcohol can give an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the process involves making a propargyl alcohol first, then oxidizing it to an aldehyde. But how would that happen?

Let me try to outline a possible synthesis path:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. The alkyne is then hydrogenated to form a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs to form a double bond, which is then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some reaction, then further modified.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol, which can be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I don't see Mg in the reagents, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent, but I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Wait, I remember that ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones. So, if the alkyne is ozonolyzed, it would break into two carbonyl groups.

But in the target molecule, we have an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group, so maybe ozonolysis is involved in forming the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: alkylates the alkyne to make a longer alkyne, say ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)ethynyl-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3: a strong base, perhaps for elimination. If the alkyne is converted into an alkene via elimination, but with what?

Wait, maybe after alkylation, the alkyne is converted into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used for a coupling reaction or for forming a stronger base.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis of any double bonds. So if the previous step formed a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: work-up, perhaps to form aldehydes/ketones.

But I'm not sure how this would produce the target molecule.

Alternatively, let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as a hydroxymethyl and aldehyde group. So that suggests that the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring's carbon, which also has the aldehyde.

So, perhaps that substituent is formed via an elimination reaction, such as the formation of a double bond followed by some addition.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a cis-alkene, then epoxidized, then opened to form an alcohol. But I don't see an epoxidation step in the options.

Hmm. Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to the main ring. But that doesn't align with the name given.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So, the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring, which also has a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then into an alcohol, then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then perhaps further modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized into a propargyl alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 adds a methyl group via alkylation, making cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd. This would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's just a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane. How does that help form the substituent with the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups?

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but in this case, after step 2, there are no double bonds. So maybe the product after step 2 is a single bond, which wouldn't react with ozone. So this doesn't seem right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Perhaps step 2 in option C is a different kind of hydrogenation. Wait, H2 and Pd-CaCO3 is probably a catalyst for hydrogenation, similar to Lindlar's but maybe for full hydrogenation. So the alkyne becomes a single bond, as before.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis, but without any double bonds, that wouldn't do anything. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2, methanol. Wait, methanol is a weaker methylating agent compared to methyl chloride. Maybe this step doesn't alkylate the alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's for some other purpose, like forming an ether. But I'm not sure. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up. Then step 4 is NH4OH.

Hmm, but without a clear pathway, I'm not sure.

Option B's steps: step 1 is alkylation with ethyl chloride, making a longer alkyne. Step 2 is Li/NH3, which might deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyls. Then, NH4OH would work up the ozonide into aldehydes or ketones.

So, let me imagine the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated with ethyl chloride to become (cyclohexyl)ethynyl-CH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Alkylation of the acetylide would add an ethyl group, making the alkyne longer.

Wait, after step 1, the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added. So, it becomes (cyclohexyl)ethynyl-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe this deprotonates and eliminates, forming a double bond. So, the alkyne would convert into an alkene. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via some elimination.

Wait, but the alkyne is already an alkyne. How would Li/NH3 affect it? Maybe it's used for deprotonation and elimination to form a more substituted alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond.

Wait, but that would require eliminating a small molecule. Perhaps the Li/NH3 is used to deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, causing the alkyne to form an alkene via elimination.

But I'm not certain about that.

Assuming that happens, the alkyne becomes an alkene. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, if you have a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2-CH2-CH2 group (from the alkylation and elimination), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. But how would that form the substituent with the cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and aldehyde groups?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces an aldehyde and a ketone, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Option D's steps: step 1 uses NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this step is for acetylide formation, but methanol isn't a good alkylating agent. Or perhaps it's for forming an ether. Then step 2 is Li/NH3, which could be for elimination, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave that, and step 4 is NH4OH to work up.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to think of the target molecule's formation.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring that also has a CHO group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. Then, the aldehyde could undergo a reaction to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized again. But I don't see any oxidizing agents in the options except for Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 with HgSO4.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some reaction to form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde. But again, I'm not sure how the reagents would achieve that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a propyl chain, which is then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's say after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then ozonolysis would require a double bond. So perhaps a double bond is formed before ozonolysis.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each step and what each reagent does.

Looking at option D again:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate terminal alkynes. Methanol is a methylating agent, but NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne, making the acetylide. Then, methanol might react with the acetylide. Acetylide + CH3OH → CH3O-... No, wait, the acetylide would react with an alkyl halide, but methanol is not an alkyl halide. So maybe in this case, the acetylide would take a methyl group from methanol? Unlikely, since methanol is a poor methylating agent without a good leaving group. So perhaps step 1 in option D doesn't alkylate the alkyne but does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 and methanol are used for deprotonation and something else, like converting the alkyne into a different functional group. But I'm not sure.

Step 2 in option D is Li/NH3. Lithium and ammonia are used for elimination reactions or for Birch reductions. Maybe it's used to reduce the alkyne to a trans-alkene. But I'm not certain.

Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if step 2 formed a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is used to work up ozonolysis, typically to prevent over-oxidation and to form aldehydes/ketones.

Putting it together:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methanol. Not sure, but perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, but methanol doesn't alkylate.

2. Then treated with Li/NH3, which may cause elimination, forming a double bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up with NH4OH would give aldehydes or ketones.

But how does this lead to the target molecule with the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups?

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is an aldehyde, which is attached to the main ring, and the other is a ketone that is further modified.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a diol, which is then oxidized. But I don't see any diol-forming steps.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think about the correct answer and what each step achieves.

The correct answer is likely option C or D. But I need to narrow it down.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. How can I form an aldehyde from an alkyne? One way is via ozonolysis of an alkyne, but that typically gives diketones. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, maybe the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a propyl chain.

3. Ozonolysis to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to acid-catalyzed hydration to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, hydration of an alkene with acid can form a carbonyl. So, if after hydrogenation, the alkene is formed, then hydration would give a ketone or aldehyde.

But in option A, after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, so that's not applicable.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. That suggests that a cyclohexyl group is added to a secondary alcohol. How can that happen?

Perhaps through a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Mg in the reagents. Alternatively, perhaps through some addition reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkene, which is then subjected to a cyclopropanation or some addition to bring in the cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a longer chain, then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a propargyl group, which is then hydrogenated to a propyl group. Then, oxidation at the end of the chain forms an aldehyde.

But I don't see any oxidizing agents in the steps except for H2SO4 in option A.

Wait, in option A, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Hock rearrangement or a sulfonation followed by oxidation. HgSO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. So perhaps this step is an oxidation.

Putting it all together, perhaps:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

Step 2: hydrogenated to form a longer alkane.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination to form a double bond.

Step 4: H2SO4 and HgSO4 oxidize the double bond or the alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then treated with Ba(OH)2 to form a ketone via oxidation.

I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the steps.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps ozonolysis is involved. Ozonolysis of a double bond would form carbonyl groups.

Looking at option B: after ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH, which would form aldehydes.

So, perhaps in option B, after forming a double bond, ozonolysis cleaves it into two aldehydes, which are attached to the cyclohexane.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to form a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form an aldehyde and another carbonyl.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde.

But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has the aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, which is attached to a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

- Hydrogenation to form a primary alcohol.

- Oxidation of the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I don't see a step for oxidation to aldehyde in the options. Wait, in option A, step 4 is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which could oxidize an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation.

Step 2: Hydrogenation to form a chain with an alcohol.

Step 3: Base treatment to eliminate and form a double bond.

Step 4: Oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Overall, I'm not entirely confident, but I think option D is not correct because it uses methanol for alkylation, which doesn't make sense. Option A's steps might involve forming an aldehyde via oxidation, but I'm not fully certain.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the CHO group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a coupling reaction, but I don't see any coupling reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a benzyl-type group, which can then undergo some ring-opening or addition.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think:

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation with H2/Pd-CaCO3 to form a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S to form carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2, a strong base.

Wait, ozonolysis of a single bond wouldn't do anything. So perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, but then that single bond is treated with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond from a vicinal diol or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond for ozonolysis.

Wait, if step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, maybe it's a partial hydrogenation, stopping at the alkene. Then, step 3 would ozonolyze the double bond into carbonyls. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a base, perhaps for elimination or saponification.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

I think I've spent a lot of time trying to figure this out, but I'm not entirely confident. Based on the options and the steps, I'll go with option C.


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent containing a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group all attached to the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to form a longer alkyne (e.g., cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ structure.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could promote elimination or other reactions, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: These reagents suggest oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding an ethyl group to form a longer alkyne (e.g., cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could deprotonate and eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: This mild acid could work up the ozonolysis products. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups are introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to form a longer alkyne (e.g., cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: This step likely hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ structure.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up could cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, the product after step 2 does not have a double bond, so this step’s role is unclear.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could promote elimination or other reactions, but its contribution to forming the target molecule is uncertain.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Methanol is not an efficient alkylating agent, so this step likely does not alkylate the alkyne. Its purpose is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could deprotonate and eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: This mild acid could work up the ozonolysis products. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups are introduced.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most plausible sequence. It involves alkylation of the terminal alkyne, hydrogenation to form a single bond, ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups, and use of Ba(OH)₂ for further reactions. While the exact mechanism is unclear, this sequence aligns most closely with the transformations needed to form the target molecule.
