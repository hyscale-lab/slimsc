Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The options are A to D, each giving expressions for V and A.

Wait, I remember that potentials are related to the fields. The scalar potential V is part of the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the fields generated by moving charges.

So, the charge q is moving with velocity v at the time tr. The observation point r is a distance d away from where the charge was at tr. Hmm, I think the potentials depend on the relative motion between the charge and the observer.

I recall that for the scalar potential V, the static case is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the point of observation. But when the charge is moving, especially in a relativistic context, there's a Lorentz contraction effect. So the potential might involve terms with the velocity v of the charge.

Wait, there's also the concept of retarded time. Because the fields propagate at the speed of light, the potentials we observe now are based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, not the present. But I'm not sure if that affects the expressions given in the options since the options already seem to include terms from the generating instant tr.

Looking at the options, option A has V as the static Coulomb form and A as v squared over c squared times V. That seems odd because the vector potential usually depends on the velocity and position in a more involved way.

Option B also has V as static Coulomb. The A is v over c squared times V. Hmm, that could make sense if the potentials are being Lorentz transformed or something.

Wait, I think in the context of potentials due to a moving charge, the scalar potential might have a term involving (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. Or perhaps it's (d c - v·d) in the denominator, which would be the same as d(c - (v·d)/d). Wait, that's the same as d multiplied by (1 - (v·d)/(c² d))... No, wait, if I factor d out, perhaps it's (d c - v·d) = d (c - (v·d)/d ) = d (c - (v·d)/(d)), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, another thought: The general expression for the scalar potential V due to a moving charge includes a term with (1/(4πε₀)) times q divided by [r' - (v t_r)/(c²)], where r' is the position at time t, and t_r is the retarded time. But maybe in this case, since they're giving d as the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, d = r - s(tr). So r = s(tr) + d.

But I think when you're considering potentials, the expressions become more involved when the charge is moving. The scalar potential V might have a term like [q / (4πε₀)] * [1/(d - (v t_r)/c²)] or something like that, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at option C and D, their V expressions have denominators with dc - d·v and dc + d·v, respectively. Let me think about the structure. The denominator in V is (d c - d·v), which can be written as c d - (v · d). Factoring d out, it's d (c - (v · d)/d ). Wait, that's the same as d (c - (v · (d/d)) ), because d is a vector. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is the invariant quantity sqrt( (d c)^2 - (v × d)^2 ), but that's for the fields, not sure about potentials.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to recall the exact expressions for potentials.

In the context of the retarded potentials, the scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / |r - (v t_r / c²)| )

Wait, but that's not exactly. Because the retarded time t_r is such that the light travel time from the charge's position at t_r to r is t - t_r. So, t_r = t - |r - s(t_r)| / c.

But perhaps for a non-relativistic case, we can approximate some terms. Alternatively, considering the Lienard potentials.

Wait, I think the potentials are expressed using the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 over the distance between r and the charge's position at t_r, but adjusted for any motion.

Wait, but the options don't seem to involve the position s(tr) directly, but rather the vector d, which is r - s(tr). So the denominator in V would be |d| times some term involving velocity.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the scalar potential for a moving charge is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d - (v t_r)/c²)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurately expressed when considering the motion.

Alternatively, another approach: The potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

But perhaps that's complicating it. Let me think about the form of the options.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Option D: Similar, but denominator is (d c + v·d).

Wait, the term (d c - v·d) can be written as c(d) - v·d. Let me factor d: d(c) - d·v = d (c - (v·d)/d ), but that might not be the right way to factor. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is written as (d c) - (v · d).

Wait, I think I remember expressions where the denominator is c times the distance minus the component of velocity along the direction of d. So, for example, if d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, then the denominator is (c |d| - v · d) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of it this way: When a charge moves, the potential expressions involve the term (r - (v t_r)/c² ), where r is the position vector of the observation point. But perhaps in this problem, d is (r - s(tr)), so d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point.

So the denominator in the potential might involve d, and perhaps some term with the velocity. Let me think of the expression for V as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / ( |d| - (v · d)/(c²) ) ]

Wait, that would make the denominator d scaled by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as (d c - v · d) / c, so that the denominator becomes (d c - v · d) divided by c.

Wait, if I factor out c from the denominator, perhaps:

( d c - v · d ) / c = d (c - (v · d)/d )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the denominator could be written as (d c - v · d), and that would be the same as d ( c - (v · d)/d ), but that might not be the standard form.

Alternatively, considering the expression for the potentials in the context of retarded time. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( d - (v t_r)/c²) ].

But t_r is the time it takes for the field to reach from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, which is (|d| ) / c. So t_r = (|d|)/c.

Wait, but perhaps that's not exactly accurate because t_r is the difference between the current time t and the time it takes the field to reach the point. So t_r = t - |d|/c.

But then, the denominator in V would involve d - (v (t - |d|/c ) / c² ) ?

Hmm, not so straightforward. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Looking at the options again, let's consider option C. In option C, V is [ q c ] / [4πε₀ (d c - v·d ) ].

Wait, the numerator is q c, the denominator is (d c - v·d ). So, the denominator can be written as c (d) - v · d = d × (c) - v · d.

Wait, that's the same as d × (c) minus the dot product of v and d. Hmm, but how does that relate to the potential expressions?

Wait, if I factor out c from the denominator, it becomes c [ d - (v · d)/(c²) ].

So denominator: c [d - (v · d)/(c²) ] = c (d (1) - (v · d)/c² ) = c [ (c² d - v · d ) / c² ] = (c² d - v · d ) / c.

Wait, so the denominator in option C is (d c - v · d ) = (c² d - v · d ) / c. So the denominator is (c squared times d minus v dot d) over c.

So V in option C is ( q c ) / [4πε₀ * ( (c² d - v·d ) / c ) ] = ( q c² ) / [4πε₀ ( c² d - v·d ) ) ].

Hmm, that's [ q c² ] / [ (4πε₀) ( c² d - v·d ) ) ].

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct form. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for V has a denominator involving (d c² - v · d c ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: potentials for a moving charge. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) (1/√( (r - (v t/c² ))² )) ), but perhaps in terms of the vector d.

But if d is r - s(tr), then s(tr) is the charge's position at tr. So, the denominator would involve d - (v (t - tr) ) / c² ), because the charge is moving, so the position at tr is s(tr), and between tr and t, the charge has moved by v (t - tr), assuming constant velocity.

Wait, so the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point is d = r - s(tr). The charge's position at time t is s(t) = s(tr) + v (t - tr). So the vector from the charge's position at t to the observation point is r - s(t) = d - v (t - tr).

So, the distance is |d - v (t - tr)|.

But t - tr is the time since the charge emitted the field. The light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the observation point is |d| / c, so t_r = t - |d| / c.

So t - tr = |d| / c.

So, the denominator in V would be |d - v (|d| / c ) |.

Hmm, so V would be (q/(4πε₀)) / |d - (v |d| ) / c² |.

Wait, because t - tr = |d| / c, so substituting that in, the denominator becomes d - (v * |d| ) / c².

But wait, d is a vector, and |d| is its magnitude. So (v |d| ) is v multiplied by the magnitude of d, which is not the same as the vector product. So d - (v |d| ) / c² is a vector. Wait, but that can't be right because you can't subtract vectors of different dimensions. Wait, wait, no, wait. d is a vector, and (v * |d| ) would be a scalar multiplied by the vector v. So the term (v |d| ) / c² is a vector in the direction of v.

So, the denominator is d (the vector from charge to r at tr) minus (v |d| ) / c², which is a vector in the direction of v.

But the expressions in the options have d c - v ·d in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think in terms of the potentials.

In the context of retarded potentials, the potentials are functions of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time tr. For a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [ 1/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

and

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [ v/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

Wait, that seems to match with option C or D.

Wait, let me compute the denominator. The denominator in V is |d| - (v·d)/(c²).

Wait, but |d| is sqrt(d · d), which is |d|.

So the denominator is |d| [ 1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|) ) ].

Which is |d| [ 1 - (v · (d/|d|) ) / c² ) ]

So the denominator is |d| (1 - (v·u)/c² ), where u is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Hmm, but in the options, the denominator is (d c - v ·d), which can be written as c d - (v · d).

Wait, let me see: denominator in option C is (d c - v·d) = c d - (v · d).

But if I factor |d| from that, it's |d| ( c - (v · (d/|d| )) ), because d = |d| (d/|d| ), and v · d = |d| (v · (d/|d| )).

So the denominator becomes |d| ( c - (v · u ) ), where u is the direction of d.

So the denominator in option C is |d| (c - v·u), which is |d| (c - (v·d)/|d| ), which matches the denominator in the potential expression I was thinking of.

So then the denominator in V is |d| (c - (v · (d/|d| )) ), which is same as (c |d| - (v · d )).

So, the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d ), which is exactly c |d| - v·d, assuming d is the vector.

Wait, but wait: d is a vector, so d c is a vector, and v·d is a scalar. So when you subtract a scalar from a vector, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because in the option C, the denominator is written as (d c - v·d ), which is a vector minus a scalar, which is incorrect. Because d c is a vector scaled by c, and v·d is a scalar. So that can't be right.

Wait, that can't be. So the options must have a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, looking back at option C: V(r,t) = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

Wait, no, because d c is a vector multiplied by scalar c, making it a vector. And v·d is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector doesn't make sense dimensionally. So option C has a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the denominator a vector minus a scalar, which is invalid. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Ah, perhaps in the options, the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), which is a scalar. Because d c is a vector, v·d is a scalar. No, that still doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v × d)) or some other vector operation. But the options say (d c - v·d ), which is a vector minus a scalar. That's a problem. So perhaps the options have a typo, but assuming that isn't the case, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c d - (v · d) ), where c d is a vector multiplied by c, and v·d is a scalar. So that would be a vector minus a scalar, which can't be correct. So perhaps the correct denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), which is a scalar.

So if the denominator is (c |d| - v·d ), then the denominator is a scalar, which makes sense. So perhaps in the options, d is the magnitude |d|.

But in the question, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So |d| is the magnitude of d.

Ah, perhaps in the options, the denominator is (d c - v · d ), where d is the vector, so this would be a vector operation, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the term is (c |d| - v · d ), which is scalar.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (d c - v · d ), but actually, d is meant to be the magnitude |d|, making the denominator c |d| - v · d, which is scalar.

So if we adjust for that, then option C's denominator is c |d| - (v · d ), which is a scalar. Because v · d is a scalar, and c |d| is a scalar.

Then, the expression for V would be:

(q c) / (4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d )) → V = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A in option C is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Wait, that makes sense because the denominator is the same as for V. So the A is proportional to v, which makes sense because the vector potential relates to the magnetic field, which depends on the charge's velocity.

But wait, what about the standard expressions for A and V? Let me think.

The standard expressions, from what I recall, are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v · d)/(c²) ) ]

But wait, |d| is the magnitude of vector d, and (v · d) is the scalar product, so (v · d)/(c²) is a scalar. So |d| - (v · d)/(c²) is a scalar, which can be the denominator.

Wait, but that would be |d| minus (v · d)/(c²) = |d| [ 1 - (v · (d/|d| )) / c² ].

So the denominator is |d| times (1 - (v · u ) / c² ), where u is the direction of d.

So the denominator is ( |d| - (v · d ) / c² )

Then, V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1 / ( |d| - (v · d ) / c² )

Which can be written as ( q c² ) / [ (4 π ε₀ ) ( c² |d| - v · d ) ) ]

Because multiplying numerator and denominator by c² gives 1 / ( |d| - (v·d)/c² ) = c² / (c² |d| - v · d )

So V becomes [ q c² ] / [ 4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

But looking at the options, option C has V as ( q c ) / [ 4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

Wait, so that's ( q c ) in the numerator and denominator (c |d| - v · d ). So compared to what I just found, it's missing a c factor in the numerator.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me re-calculate.

The standard expression for V is:

V = ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| - (v · d )/( c² ) ) ]

But |d| is the magnitude of vector d, and (v · d) is the scalar product.

So if I factor out |d| from the denominator:

V = ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| [ 1 - (v · (d/|d| )) / c² ] ) ]

Which is V = ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · u ) / c² ) ) ]

= ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * (1/|d| ) * [ 1 / ( 1 - (v · u )/c² ) ]

≈ ( q / (4 π ε₀ |d| ) ) * [ 1 + (v · u )/c² + ... ]

But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in option C is correct, and I need to see what the potentials look like.

Looking at option C: V = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Wait, but from the standard expression, V would have a denominator of ( |d| - (v · d ) / c² ), which is ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c².

So inverting that gives c² / ( c² |d| - v · d )

So V's expression is ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ c² / ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( q c² ) / [ 4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

But in option C, it's ( q c ) / [ 4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the denominator in the scalar potential V is |d| - (v · d ) / c². Wait, because d is a vector. So (v · d) is a scalar, but |d| is scalar.

So the denominator is a scalar, |d| - (v · d ) / c².

Wait, but (v · d ) is |v| |d| cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

Hmm, but perhaps I should write the denominator as [ c² |d| - (v · d) ] / c².

Wait, that's because |d| = |d| * c² / c², so |d| = (c² |d| ) / c².

Then, |d| - (v · d ) / c² = ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) / c².

So the denominator is (c² |d| - (v · d )) / c².

So V becomes:

V = ( q/(4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1 / ( ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) / c² ) ]

Which is ( q/(4 π ε₀ ) ) * ( c² / ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) )

So V = ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which can be factored as ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c ( |d| c ) - (v · d ) ) ]

Wait, but |d| c is c |d|, so the denominator is (c |d| ) * c - (v · d )

= c ( c |d| ) - (v · d )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Looking back at the options, option C has denominator (c |d| - (v · d )) in the denominator, but with a c in the numerator.

So in option C, V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

But according to the correct expression, V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ (c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Which would be ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c (c |d| ) - v · d ) ]

Wait, but option C's denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), and the numerator is q c. So unless I'm making a mistake, option C doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between vector and scalar terms. Let me think: option C's denominator is (d c - v · d ), which, if d is the vector, then d c is a vector, and v · d is a scalar. So the denominator is a vector minus a scalar, which is invalid. So perhaps the options have a typo, and the denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), which is scalar.

Assuming that, then option C's V would be ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

But according to the correct expression, V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ (c² |d| - v · d ) ]

So option C's V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

But the correct V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

So option C's V is q c / [ ... ] and correct is q c² / [ ... ]

So unless I'm missing a factor, option C's V doesn't match.

But wait, let me think about the vector potential A.

The vector potential A for a moving charge is given by:

A = ( μ₀ q )/(4 π ) * [ v / ( |d| - (v · d )/c² ) ]

Which would be ( μ₀ q )/(4 π ) * [ v c² ] / ( c² |d| - (v · d ) )

So A = ( μ₀ q c² v ) / (4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Looking at option C, A is ( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

So the denominator in A is ( c |d| - v · d ), which is the same as (c² |d| - v · d ) when multiplied by c. So option C's A is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( (c |d| - v · d ) / c ) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, if we multiply numerator and denominator by c, then:

( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c ( c |d| - v · d ) / c ) ] → Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the correct A is ( μ₀ q v ) / (4 π ( |d| - (v · d )/c² ) )

Which is ( μ₀ q v ) / (4 π [ (c² |d| - v · d ) / c² ] )

Which simplifies to ( μ₀ q v c² ) / (4 π (c² |d| - v · d ) )

Comparing with option C's A:

Option C: ( μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) )

Which is ( μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) )

So, the numerator in the correct A is μ₀ q v c², and option C has μ₀ q v c.

So if the denominator in option C is (c |d| - v · d ), then option C's A is μ₀ q c v / [ ... ].

But the correct expression is μ₀ q v c² / [ ... ]

So option C's A is missing a factor of c in the numerator compared to the correct expression.

Hmm, this suggests that option C isn't the right choice. But perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the denominator in option C's A is ( c |d| - v · d ), which is (c² |d| - (v · d )) / c.

So ( c |d| - v · d ) = [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ] / c.

So the denominator in option C is [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ] / c.

So option C's A is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ] / c ) ]

Which becomes [ μ₀ q c v * c ] / [4 π ( c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which is [ μ₀ q v c² ] / [4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which matches the correct expression for A.

Ah, that's important. So option C's A would be correct if the denominator is ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c, which is (c |d| - (v · d ) / c )

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - v ·d ), which is not the same as (c² |d| - v ·d ) / c. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( c |d| - (v · d ) ), which is (c^2 |d| - (v · d )) / c.

Wait, no. Let me compute:

(c |d| - (v · d )) = c |d| - (v · d )

Which is the same as [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) c ] / c.

Wait, that's not the same as (c² |d| - (v · d )) / c.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think again.

The correct V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which can be written as [ q c / (4 π ε₀ ) ] * [ c / ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Wait, but option C has V as ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

So if I factor c from the denominator in option C's V denominator, it's ( c ( |d| ) - (v · d ) ) = c |d| - (v · d )

So the denominator is c |d| - (v · d ) = c ( |d| ) - (v · d )

But the correct V has a denominator of c² |d| - (v · d )

So option C's denominator is smaller by a factor of c.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the units.

The scalar potential V has units of volts (V). Let's check option C's units.

V in option C: [ q c ] / [ (4 π ε₀ ) ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Units of numerator: q (C), c (m/s) → C·m/s.

Denominator: 4 π ε₀ has units C²/(N·m²). [ (4 π ε₀ ) (c |d| - v·d ) ] → [ C²/(N·m²) ] * (m) → C²/(N·m²) ) * m = C²/(N·m)

So the entire denominator is C²/(N·m).

So V's units would be ( C·m/s ) / ( C²/(N·m) ) ) → ( m/s * N·m ) / C ) → ( N·m²/s ) / C.

But 1 N = 1 C·V/m, so N·m²/s = (C·V/m) * m² / s = C·V·m/s.

So units become ( C·V·m/s ) / C ) → V·m/s.

But volts (V) is (J/C) = (N·m/C), so V·m/s is (N·m/C) * m/s = N·m²/(C·s) → which isn't correct. So the units in option C's V are incorrect.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled up in unit analysis. Let's instead think in terms of the correct expressions.

I think I remember that the potentials for a moving charge have the form:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

A = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * [ v/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

So let me compute the denominator:

denominator = |d| - (v·d)/(c²)

Which is scalar.

So the expressions for V and A are:

V = ( q/(4πε₀) ) * 1/(denom )

A = ( μ₀ q/(4π) ) * v/(denom )

So, let me write denom as ( |d| c² - v·d ) / c² → denom = ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c².

So,

V = ( q/(4π ε₀) ) * c² / ( c² |d| - v · d )

= ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Similarly,

A = ( μ₀ q/(4 π) ) * v c² / ( c² |d| - v · d )

= ( μ₀ q c² v ) / [4 π ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

So, looking at the options, option C has:

V = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( q c ) / [ ... ]

Comparing to our correct V: ( q c² ) / [ ... ]

So option C's V is missing a factor of c.

Similarly, option C's A is:

( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( μ₀ q c v ) / [ ... ]

Correct A is ( μ₀ q c² v ) / [ ... ]

So again, option C's A has a factor of c less.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator expression.

Wait, let me re-express denom = |d| - (v·d)/(c²).

Which can be written as ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c².

So, the denominator is ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c² → denom = ( c² |d| - v·d ) / c².

So, 1/denom = c² / ( c² |d| - v·d )

So, V = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ c² / ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Which is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Similarly, A = ( μ₀ q /4 π ) * [ v c² / ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

= ( μ₀ q c² v ) / [4 π ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

So, looking at the options, none of them seem to match this exactly. Wait, looking at option C again.

Option C: V(r, t) = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

So, V's denominator is ( c |d| - v·d ), which is different from our expression's ( c² |d| - v·d ). So perhaps option C is scaled by a factor of c.

Wait, perhaps the correct denominator is ( c |d| - (v·d)/c ), which would be same as (c² |d| - v·d ) / c. Then, the option C's denominator is ( c |d| - v·d ), which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the correct expressions should have ( c |d| - (v·d)/c ), which would be same as (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

But that would make the denominator ( c |d| - (v·d)/c )

Wait, but in that case, the correct V would be ( q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ] which is same as ( q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ c² / ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Which is same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says V is (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * 1/r ), and A is (v/(c² )) V.

So if V is static, that's Coulomb's law. But for a moving charge, the potentials aren't static, so option B would only be correct in the non-relativistic, static case, but the problem states that the charge is moving, so option B is probably incorrect.

Option D has denominators (c |d| + v·d ) in V and A. But the terms would be positive, which might not make sense in terms of causality, because if the charge is moving away, you don't want the denominator to be larger, making the potential smaller, but perhaps I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the denominator in the potentials is related to the time it takes for the field to propagate. If the charge is moving towards the observer, the denominator would be smaller, leading to a larger potential. So, if the term (v · d) is positive, that would increase the denominator in option C, making the potential smaller. Hmm, that might make sense.

Wait, let me think about the direction. If the charge is moving towards the observer (v · d positive), then the denominator in option C is (c |d| - v·d ), which would be smaller than c |d|, making the potential larger. That makes sense because the charge is moving closer, so the field is stronger.

So option C's V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v·d ) ]

Which, when v·d is positive (charge moving towards observer), denominator is smaller, making V larger. That's correct.

But earlier, when I compared the units, option C's units weren't matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Let me re-calculate the units for option C's V.

V in option C: ( q c ) / [ (4 π ε₀ ) ( c |d| - v·d ) ]

Units:

q: Coulombs (C)

c: m/s

ε₀: F/m = C²/(N·m²) → C²·s²/(kg·m³)

So, denominator: 4 π ε₀ has units of C²·s²/(kg·m³)

Multiply by (c |d| - v·d ), which has units of m.

So denominator's units: C²·s²/(kg·m³) * m = C²·s²/(kg·m²)

Numerator: q c → C * m/s

So V's units: ( C * m/s ) / ( C²·s²/(kg·m²) ) )

= ( kg·m² ) / ( C·s³ )

But 1 V has units kg·m²/(C·s³ ), so this matches.

Wait, yes! Because V = J/C, and J is kg·m²/s². So V has units kg·m²/(C·s³ ), which matches.

So option C's V has the correct units.

Similarly, let's check A's units in option C.

A in option C: ( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - v·d ) ]

μ₀: H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²) → kg·m/(s²·C² )

q: C

c: m/s

v: m/s

Denominator: same as before, units m.

So numerator: μ₀ q c v → ( kg·m/(s²·C²) ) * C * (m/s ) * (m/s )

= kg·m/(s²·C²) * C * m²/s²

= kg·m³/(s^4 · C )

Denominator: m

So A's units: ( kg·m³/(s^4 · C ) ) / m → kg·m²/(s^4 · C )

But vector potential A has units kg·m²/(s²·C ), because it's measured in Tesla·m² (since B is Tesla, which is kg/(s²·A), and A is ampere = C/s. So Tesla is kg/(s²·C) · m² → kg·m²/(s²·C) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The units for vector potential A should be Tesla·meter, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the units for A are Weber per meter squared? No, wait, Weber is Tesla·m². Hmm, perhaps I should just think in terms of the expression.

Wait, but let's compute the units for option C's A.

μ₀ has units of H/m → H is Wb/(A·m) → Wb is T·m², so H is T·m²/(A·m) ) → T·m/A.

So μ₀ is T·m/A per m → T/(A )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

μ₀ = 4 π ×1e-7 H/m → H is Wb/A (since inductance L has units H, and flux Φ is Wb = V·s = (J/C)·s = (kg·m²/s²)·s = kg·m²/s.

So Φ = Wb = kg·m²/s.

Thus, H = Wb/A = (kg·m²/s ) / (C/s ) ) → kg·m²/(C )

So μ₀ = 4π ×1e-7 H/m → (kg·m²/(C )) / m ) → kg·m/(C )

So μ₀ has units kg·m/(C )

So, back to A's units in option C:

μ₀ q c v → [ kg·m/(C ) ] * C * (m/s ) * (m/s )

= kg·m/(C ) * C * m²/s² → kg·m³/(s² )

Denominator: m

So A's units: ( kg·m³/s² ) / m → kg·m²/s²

Which isn't correct because A should have units of kg·m²/(C·s² ) → since it's a vector potential, which when multiplied by charge gives momentum etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me try again.

The vector potential A has units of kg·m²/(s²·C ), because it's related to the magnetic field B (kg/(s²·C )) via B = ∇ × A.

So, the correct units for A should be kg·m²/(s²·C )

Now, let's compute the units for option C's A.

Option C's A: ( μ₀ q c v ) / ( c |d| - v·d )

μ₀ has units kg·m/(s²·C² )

q: C

c: m/s

v: m/s

Denominator: m (since c |d| is m/s * m = m²/s * s → m. Wait, no, |d| is m, so c |d| is (m/s) * m = m²/s. Hmm, but that would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm messing up the units.

Wait, perhaps I should do this more carefully.

μ₀ → kg·m/(s²·A²) → since A is C/s, so A² = C²/s².

Thus, μ₀ → kg·m/(s² * (C²/s² )) ) → kg·m/(C² )

So, μ₀ q → ( kg·m/C² ) * C ) → kg·m/C.

c → m/s

v → m/s

So numerator: μ₀ q c v → ( kg·m/C ) * (m/s ) * (m/s ) → kg·m³/(C·s² )

Denominator: (c |d| - v ·d ) → (m/s * m ) - ( m/s * m ) → which is (m²/s ) - (m²/s ) → units are m²/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because the denominator must be a scalar. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, because |d| is a scalar in meters, c is m/s, so c |d| is (m/s ) * m → m²/s. Similarly, v ·d is (m/s ) * m → m²/s. So the denominator has units m²/s.

So, units of denominator: m²/s.

Thus, the units of option C's A are:

( kg·m³/(C·s² ) ) / ( m²/s ) ) → ( kg·m³/(C·s² ) ) * ( s / m² ) → kg·m·s/(C·s² ) → kg·m/(C·s )

Which simplifies to kg·m/(C·s ), which is (kg·m²/(C·s² )) ) * s/m → which isn't matching the required units for A.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me check another way.

The vector potential A has units Tesla·meter (T·m). Since Tesla is kg/(s²·A), and A is Coulombs per second (C/s), then Tesla is kg/(s²·(C/s)) )= kg·s/(C²).

So, T·m = kg·s/(C² ) * m = kg·m·s/(C² )

But the units of option C's A are kg·m/(C·s ), which is not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the unit analysis. Maybe I should move on.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option C, even though my earlier analysis suggested some discrepancies. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the derivation.

Considering that option C's V and A have the same denominator and structure, and that in the standard expressions, the potentials involve the velocity v and the distance d, I think option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options and compare them to the standard expressions for retarded potentials. The scalar potential \( V \) is influenced by the charge's motion, and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) depends on the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \). The denominator in both potentials involves the vector \( \vec{d} \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and the velocity \( \vec{v} \).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \): This is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): This expression for \( \vec{A} \) is inconsistent because the vector potential should depend linearly on \( \vec{v} \), not \( \vec{v}^2 \).  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \): Again, this is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): While this form for \( \vec{A} \) is dimensionally consistent, the static potential \( V \) is not valid for a moving charge.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This matches the structure of the retarded scalar potential, where the denominator includes the motion of the charge through the term \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This matches the structure of the retarded vector potential, where \( \vec{A} \) depends linearly on \( \vec{v} \) and has the same denominator as \( V \).  
   **Conclusion**: Correct.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): The denominator includes \( +\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is inconsistent with the retarded potential expressions, where the denominator should subtract \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): Similar to \( V \), the denominator is incorrect.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Option C is the correct choice because it provides the correct forms for both the scalar and vector potentials, consistent with the retarded potential expressions for a moving charge.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The options are A to D, each giving expressions for V and A.

Wait, I remember that potentials are related to the fields. The scalar potential V is part of the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the fields generated by moving charges.

So, the charge q is moving with velocity v at the time tr. The observation point r is a distance d away from where the charge was at tr. Hmm, I think the potentials depend on the relative motion between the charge and the observer.

I recall that for the scalar potential V, the static case is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the point of observation. But when the charge is moving, especially in a relativistic context, there's a Lorentz contraction effect. So the potential might involve terms with the velocity v of the charge.

Wait, there's also the concept of retarded time. Because the fields propagate at the speed of light, the potentials we observe now are based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, not the present. But I'm not sure if that affects the expressions given in the options since the options already seem to include terms from the generating instant tr.

Looking at the options, option A has V as the static Coulomb form and A as v squared over c squared times V. That seems odd because the vector potential usually depends on the velocity and position in a more involved way.

Option B also has V as static Coulomb. The A is v over c squared times V. Hmm, that could make sense if the potentials are being Lorentz transformed or something.

Wait, I think in the context of potentials due to a moving charge, the scalar potential might have a term involving (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. Or perhaps it's (d c - v·d) in the denominator, which would be the same as d(c - (v·d)/d). Wait, that's the same as d multiplied by (1 - (v·d)/(c² d))... No, wait, if I factor d out, perhaps it's (d c - v·d) = d (c - (v·d)/d ) = d (c - (v·d)/(d)), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, another thought: The general expression for the scalar potential V due to a moving charge includes a term with (1/(4πε₀)) times q divided by [r' - (v t_r)/(c²)], where r' is the position at time t, and t_r is the retarded time. But maybe in this case, since they're giving d as the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, d = r - s(tr). So r = s(tr) + d.

But I think when you're considering potentials, the expressions become more involved when the charge is moving. The scalar potential V might have a term like [q / (4πε₀)] * [1/(d - (v t_r)/c²)] or something like that, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at option C and D, their V expressions have denominators with dc - d·v and dc + d·v, respectively. Let me think about the structure. The denominator in V is (d c - d·v), which can be written as c d - (v · d). Factoring d out, it's d (c - (v · d)/d ). Wait, that's the same as d (c - (v · (d/d)) ), because d is a vector. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is the invariant quantity sqrt( (d c)^2 - (v × d)^2 ), but that's for the fields, not sure about potentials.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to recall the exact expressions for potentials.

In the context of the retarded potentials, the scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / |r - (v t_r / c²)| )

Wait, but that's not exactly. Because the retarded time t_r is such that the light travel time from the charge's position at t_r to r is t - t_r. So, t_r = t - |r - s(t_r)| / c.

But perhaps for a non-relativistic case, we can approximate some terms. Alternatively, considering the Lienard potentials.

Wait, I think the potentials are expressed using the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 over the distance between r and the charge's position at t_r, but adjusted for any motion.

Wait, but the options don't seem to involve the position s(tr) directly, but rather the vector d, which is r - s(tr). So the denominator in V would be |d| times some term involving velocity.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the scalar potential for a moving charge is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d - (v t_r)/c²)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurately expressed when considering the motion.

Alternatively, another approach: The potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

But perhaps that's complicating it. Let me think about the form of the options.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Option D: Similar, but denominator is (d c + v·d).

Wait, the term (d c - v·d) can be written as c(d) - v·d. Let me factor d: d(c) - d·v = d (c - (v·d)/d ), but that might not be the right way to factor. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is written as (d c) - (v · d).

Wait, I think I remember expressions where the denominator is c times the distance minus the component of velocity along the direction of d. So, for example, if d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, then the denominator is (c |d| - v · d) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of it this way: When a charge moves, the potential expressions involve the term (r - (v t_r)/c² ), where r is the position vector of the observation point. But perhaps in this problem, d is (r - s(tr)), so d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point.

So the denominator in the potential might involve d, and perhaps some term with the velocity. Let me think of the expression for V as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / ( |d| - (v · d)/(c²) ) ]

Wait, that would make the denominator d scaled by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as (d c - v · d) / c, so that the denominator becomes (d c - v · d) divided by c.

Wait, if I factor out c from the denominator, perhaps:

( d c - v · d ) / c = d (c - (v · d)/d )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the denominator could be written as (d c - v · d), and that would be the same as d ( c - (v · d)/d ), but that might not be the standard form.

Alternatively, considering the expression for the potentials in the context of retarded time. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( d - (v t_r)/c²) ].

But t_r is the time it takes for the field to reach from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, which is (|d| ) / c. So t_r = (|d|)/c.

Wait, but perhaps that's not exactly accurate because t_r is the difference between the current time t and the time it takes the field to reach the point. So t_r = t - |d|/c.

But then, the denominator in V would involve d - (v (t - |d|/c ) / c² ) ?

Hmm, not so straightforward. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Looking at the options again, let's consider option C. In option C, V is [ q c ] / [4πε₀ (d c - v·d ) ].

Wait, the numerator is q c, the denominator is (d c - v·d ). So, the denominator can be written as c (d) - v · d = d × (c) - v · d.

Wait, that's the same as d × (c) minus the dot product of v and d. Hmm, but how does that relate to the potential expressions?

Wait, if I factor out c from the denominator, it becomes c [ d - (v · d)/(c²) ].

So denominator: c [d - (v · d)/(c²) ] = c (d (1) - (v · d)/c² ) = c [ (c² d - v · d ) / c² ] = (c² d - v · d ) / c.

Wait, so the denominator in option C is (d c - v · d ) = (c² d - v · d ) / c. So the denominator is (c squared times d minus v dot d) over c.

So V in option C is ( q c ) / [4πε₀ * ( (c² d - v·d ) / c ) ] = ( q c² ) / [4πε₀ ( c² d - v·d ) ) ].

Hmm, that's [ q c² ] / [ (4πε₀) ( c² d - v·d ) ) ].

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct form. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for V has a denominator involving (d c² - v · d c ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: potentials for a moving charge. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) (1/√( (r - (v t/c² ))² )) ), but perhaps in terms of the vector d.

But if d is r - s(tr), then s(tr) is the charge's position at tr. So, the denominator would involve d - (v (t - tr) ) / c² ), because the charge is moving, so the position at tr is s(tr), and between tr and t, the charge has moved by v (t - tr), assuming constant velocity.

Wait, so the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point is d = r - s(tr). The charge's position at time t is s(t) = s(tr) + v (t - tr). So the vector from the charge's position at t to the observation point is r - s(t) = d - v (t - tr).

So, the distance is |d - v (t - tr)|.

But t - tr is the time since the charge emitted the field. The light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the observation point is |d| / c, so t_r = t - |d| / c.

So t - tr = |d| / c.

So, the denominator in V would be |d - v (|d| / c ) |.

Hmm, so V would be (q/(4πε₀)) / |d - (v |d| ) / c² |.

Wait, because t - tr = |d| / c, so substituting that in, the denominator becomes d - (v * |d| ) / c².

But wait, d is a vector, and |d| is its magnitude. So (v |d| ) is v multiplied by the magnitude of d, which is not the same as the vector product. So d - (v |d| ) / c² is a vector. Wait, but that can't be right because you can't subtract vectors of different dimensions. Wait, wait, no, wait. d is a vector, and (v * |d| ) would be a scalar multiplied by the vector v. So the term (v |d| ) / c² is a vector in the direction of v.

So, the denominator is d (the vector from charge to r at tr) minus (v |d| ) / c², which is a vector in the direction of v.

But the expressions in the options have d c - v ·d in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think in terms of the potentials.

In the context of retarded potentials, the potentials are functions of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time tr. For a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [ 1/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

and

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [ v/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

Wait, that seems to match with option C or D.

Wait, let me compute the denominator. The denominator in V is |d| - (v·d)/(c²).

Wait, but |d| is sqrt(d · d), which is |d|.

So the denominator is |d| [ 1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|) ) ].

Which is |d| [ 1 - (v · (d/|d|) ) / c² ) ]

So the denominator is |d| (1 - (v·u)/c² ), where u is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Hmm, but in the options, the denominator is (d c - v ·d), which can be written as c d - (v · d).

Wait, let me see: denominator in option C is (d c - v·d) = c d - (v · d).

But if I factor |d| from that, it's |d| ( c - (v · (d/|d| )) ), because d = |d| (d/|d| ), and v · d = |d| (v · (d/|d| )).

So the denominator becomes |d| ( c - (v · u ) ), where u is the direction of d.

So the denominator in option C is |d| (c - v·u), which is |d| (c - (v·d)/|d| ), which matches the denominator in the potential expression I was thinking of.

So then the denominator in V is |d| (c - (v · (d/|d| )) ), which is same as (c |d| - (v · d )).

So, the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d ), which is exactly c |d| - v·d, assuming d is the vector.

Wait, but wait: d is a vector, so d c is a vector, and v·d is a scalar. So when you subtract a scalar from a vector, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because in the option C, the denominator is written as (d c - v·d ), which is a vector minus a scalar, which is incorrect. Because d c is a vector scaled by c, and v·d is a scalar. So that can't be right.

Wait, that can't be. So the options must have a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, looking back at option C: V(r,t) = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

Wait, no, because d c is a vector multiplied by scalar c, making it a vector. And v·d is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector doesn't make sense dimensionally. So option C has a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the denominator a vector minus a scalar, which is invalid. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Ah, perhaps in the options, the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), which is a scalar. Because d c is a vector, v·d is a scalar. No, that still doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v × d)) or some other vector operation. But the options say (d c - v·d ), which is a vector minus a scalar. That's a problem. So perhaps the options have a typo, but assuming that isn't the case, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c d - (v · d) ), where c d is a vector multiplied by c, and v·d is a scalar. So that would be a vector minus a scalar, which can't be correct. So perhaps the correct denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), which is a scalar.

So if the denominator is (c |d| - v·d ), then the denominator is a scalar, which makes sense. So perhaps in the options, d is the magnitude |d|.

But in the question, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So |d| is the magnitude of d.

Ah, perhaps in the options, the denominator is (d c - v · d ), where d is the vector, so this would be a vector operation, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the term is (c |d| - v · d ), which is scalar.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is written as (d c - v · d ), but actually, d is meant to be the magnitude |d|, making the denominator c |d| - v · d, which is scalar.

So if we adjust for that, then option C's denominator is c |d| - (v · d ), which is a scalar. Because v · d is a scalar, and c |d| is a scalar.

Then, the expression for V would be:

(q c) / (4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d )) → V = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A in option C is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Wait, that makes sense because the denominator is the same as for V. So the A is proportional to v, which makes sense because the vector potential relates to the magnetic field, which depends on the charge's velocity.

But wait, what about the standard expressions for A and V? Let me think.

The standard expressions, from what I recall, are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v · d)/(c²) ) ]

But wait, |d| is the magnitude of vector d, and (v · d) is the scalar product, so (v · d)/(c²) is a scalar. So |d| - (v · d)/(c²) is a scalar, which can be the denominator.

Wait, but that would be |d| minus (v · d)/(c²) = |d| [ 1 - (v · (d/|d| )) / c² ].

So the denominator is |d| times (1 - (v · u ) / c² ), where u is the direction of d.

So the denominator is ( |d| - (v · d ) / c² )

Then, V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1 / ( |d| - (v · d ) / c² )

Which can be written as ( q c² ) / [ (4 π ε₀ ) ( c² |d| - v · d ) ) ]

Because multiplying numerator and denominator by c² gives 1 / ( |d| - (v·d)/c² ) = c² / (c² |d| - v · d )

So V becomes [ q c² ] / [ 4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

But looking at the options, option C has V as ( q c ) / [ 4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

Wait, so that's ( q c ) in the numerator and denominator (c |d| - v · d ). So compared to what I just found, it's missing a c factor in the numerator.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me re-calculate.

The standard expression for V is:

V = ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| - (v · d )/( c² ) ) ]

But |d| is the magnitude of vector d, and (v · d) is the scalar product.

So if I factor out |d| from the denominator:

V = ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| [ 1 - (v · (d/|d| )) / c² ] ) ]

Which is V = ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · u ) / c² ) ) ]

= ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * (1/|d| ) * [ 1 / ( 1 - (v · u )/c² ) ]

≈ ( q / (4 π ε₀ |d| ) ) * [ 1 + (v · u )/c² + ... ]

But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in option C is correct, and I need to see what the potentials look like.

Looking at option C: V = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Wait, but from the standard expression, V would have a denominator of ( |d| - (v · d ) / c² ), which is ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c².

So inverting that gives c² / ( c² |d| - v · d )

So V's expression is ( q / (4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ c² / ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( q c² ) / [ 4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

But in option C, it's ( q c ) / [ 4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the denominator in the scalar potential V is |d| - (v · d ) / c². Wait, because d is a vector. So (v · d) is a scalar, but |d| is scalar.

So the denominator is a scalar, |d| - (v · d ) / c².

Wait, but (v · d ) is |v| |d| cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

Hmm, but perhaps I should write the denominator as [ c² |d| - (v · d) ] / c².

Wait, that's because |d| = |d| * c² / c², so |d| = (c² |d| ) / c².

Then, |d| - (v · d ) / c² = ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) / c².

So the denominator is (c² |d| - (v · d )) / c².

So V becomes:

V = ( q/(4 π ε₀ ) ) * [ 1 / ( ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) / c² ) ]

Which is ( q/(4 π ε₀ ) ) * ( c² / ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) )

So V = ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which can be factored as ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c ( |d| c ) - (v · d ) ) ]

Wait, but |d| c is c |d|, so the denominator is (c |d| ) * c - (v · d )

= c ( c |d| ) - (v · d )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Looking back at the options, option C has denominator (c |d| - (v · d )) in the denominator, but with a c in the numerator.

So in option C, V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

But according to the correct expression, V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ (c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Which would be ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c (c |d| ) - v · d ) ]

Wait, but option C's denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), and the numerator is q c. So unless I'm making a mistake, option C doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between vector and scalar terms. Let me think: option C's denominator is (d c - v · d ), which, if d is the vector, then d c is a vector, and v · d is a scalar. So the denominator is a vector minus a scalar, which is invalid. So perhaps the options have a typo, and the denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), which is scalar.

Assuming that, then option C's V would be ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

But according to the correct expression, V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ (c² |d| - v · d ) ]

So option C's V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

But the correct V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

So option C's V is q c / [ ... ] and correct is q c² / [ ... ]

So unless I'm missing a factor, option C's V doesn't match.

But wait, let me think about the vector potential A.

The vector potential A for a moving charge is given by:

A = ( μ₀ q )/(4 π ) * [ v / ( |d| - (v · d )/c² ) ]

Which would be ( μ₀ q )/(4 π ) * [ v c² ] / ( c² |d| - (v · d ) )

So A = ( μ₀ q c² v ) / (4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Looking at option C, A is ( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

So the denominator in A is ( c |d| - v · d ), which is the same as (c² |d| - v · d ) when multiplied by c. So option C's A is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( (c |d| - v · d ) / c ) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, if we multiply numerator and denominator by c, then:

( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c ( c |d| - v · d ) / c ) ] → Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the correct A is ( μ₀ q v ) / (4 π ( |d| - (v · d )/c² ) )

Which is ( μ₀ q v ) / (4 π [ (c² |d| - v · d ) / c² ] )

Which simplifies to ( μ₀ q v c² ) / (4 π (c² |d| - v · d ) )

Comparing with option C's A:

Option C: ( μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) )

Which is ( μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) )

So, the numerator in the correct A is μ₀ q v c², and option C has μ₀ q v c.

So if the denominator in option C is (c |d| - v · d ), then option C's A is μ₀ q c v / [ ... ].

But the correct expression is μ₀ q v c² / [ ... ]

So option C's A is missing a factor of c in the numerator compared to the correct expression.

Hmm, this suggests that option C isn't the right choice. But perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the denominator in option C's A is ( c |d| - v · d ), which is (c² |d| - (v · d )) / c.

So ( c |d| - v · d ) = [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ] / c.

So the denominator in option C is [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ] / c.

So option C's A is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ] / c ) ]

Which becomes [ μ₀ q c v * c ] / [4 π ( c^2 |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which is [ μ₀ q v c² ] / [4 π ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which matches the correct expression for A.

Ah, that's important. So option C's A would be correct if the denominator is ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c, which is (c |d| - (v · d ) / c )

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (c |d| - v ·d ), which is not the same as (c² |d| - v ·d ) / c. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is ( c |d| - (v · d ) ), which is (c^2 |d| - (v · d )) / c.

Wait, no. Let me compute:

(c |d| - (v · d )) = c |d| - (v · d )

Which is the same as [ c^2 |d| - (v · d ) c ] / c.

Wait, that's not the same as (c² |d| - (v · d )) / c.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think again.

The correct V is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Which can be written as [ q c / (4 π ε₀ ) ] * [ c / ( c² |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Wait, but option C has V as ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

So if I factor c from the denominator in option C's V denominator, it's ( c ( |d| ) - (v · d ) ) = c |d| - (v · d )

So the denominator is c |d| - (v · d ) = c ( |d| ) - (v · d )

But the correct V has a denominator of c² |d| - (v · d )

So option C's denominator is smaller by a factor of c.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the units.

The scalar potential V has units of volts (V). Let's check option C's units.

V in option C: [ q c ] / [ (4 π ε₀ ) ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ]

Units of numerator: q (C), c (m/s) → C·m/s.

Denominator: 4 π ε₀ has units C²/(N·m²). [ (4 π ε₀ ) (c |d| - v·d ) ] → [ C²/(N·m²) ] * (m) → C²/(N·m²) ) * m = C²/(N·m)

So the entire denominator is C²/(N·m).

So V's units would be ( C·m/s ) / ( C²/(N·m) ) ) → ( m/s * N·m ) / C ) → ( N·m²/s ) / C.

But 1 N = 1 C·V/m, so N·m²/s = (C·V/m) * m² / s = C·V·m/s.

So units become ( C·V·m/s ) / C ) → V·m/s.

But volts (V) is (J/C) = (N·m/C), so V·m/s is (N·m/C) * m/s = N·m²/(C·s) → which isn't correct. So the units in option C's V are incorrect.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled up in unit analysis. Let's instead think in terms of the correct expressions.

I think I remember that the potentials for a moving charge have the form:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

A = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * [ v/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

So let me compute the denominator:

denominator = |d| - (v·d)/(c²)

Which is scalar.

So the expressions for V and A are:

V = ( q/(4πε₀) ) * 1/(denom )

A = ( μ₀ q/(4π) ) * v/(denom )

So, let me write denom as ( |d| c² - v·d ) / c² → denom = ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c².

So,

V = ( q/(4π ε₀) ) * c² / ( c² |d| - v · d )

= ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

Similarly,

A = ( μ₀ q/(4 π) ) * v c² / ( c² |d| - v · d )

= ( μ₀ q c² v ) / [4 π ( c² |d| - v · d ) ]

So, looking at the options, option C has:

V = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( q c ) / [ ... ]

Comparing to our correct V: ( q c² ) / [ ... ]

So option C's V is missing a factor of c.

Similarly, option C's A is:

( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

Which is ( μ₀ q c v ) / [ ... ]

Correct A is ( μ₀ q c² v ) / [ ... ]

So again, option C's A has a factor of c less.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator expression.

Wait, let me re-express denom = |d| - (v·d)/(c²).

Which can be written as ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c².

So, the denominator is ( c² |d| - v · d ) / c² → denom = ( c² |d| - v·d ) / c².

So, 1/denom = c² / ( c² |d| - v·d )

So, V = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ c² / ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Which is ( q c² ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Similarly, A = ( μ₀ q /4 π ) * [ v c² / ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

= ( μ₀ q c² v ) / [4 π ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

So, looking at the options, none of them seem to match this exactly. Wait, looking at option C again.

Option C: V(r, t) = ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v · d ) ]

So, V's denominator is ( c |d| - v·d ), which is different from our expression's ( c² |d| - v·d ). So perhaps option C is scaled by a factor of c.

Wait, perhaps the correct denominator is ( c |d| - (v·d)/c ), which would be same as (c² |d| - v·d ) / c. Then, the option C's denominator is ( c |d| - v·d ), which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the correct expressions should have ( c |d| - (v·d)/c ), which would be same as (c² |d| - v·d ) / c.

But that would make the denominator ( c |d| - (v·d)/c )

Wait, but in that case, the correct V would be ( q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( |d| - (v·d)/(c²) ) ] which is same as ( q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ c² / ( c² |d| - v·d ) ]

Which is same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says V is (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * 1/r ), and A is (v/(c² )) V.

So if V is static, that's Coulomb's law. But for a moving charge, the potentials aren't static, so option B would only be correct in the non-relativistic, static case, but the problem states that the charge is moving, so option B is probably incorrect.

Option D has denominators (c |d| + v·d ) in V and A. But the terms would be positive, which might not make sense in terms of causality, because if the charge is moving away, you don't want the denominator to be larger, making the potential smaller, but perhaps I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the denominator in the potentials is related to the time it takes for the field to propagate. If the charge is moving towards the observer, the denominator would be smaller, leading to a larger potential. So, if the term (v · d) is positive, that would increase the denominator in option C, making the potential smaller. Hmm, that might make sense.

Wait, let me think about the direction. If the charge is moving towards the observer (v · d positive), then the denominator in option C is (c |d| - v·d ), which would be smaller than c |d|, making the potential larger. That makes sense because the charge is moving closer, so the field is stronger.

So option C's V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - v·d ) ]

Which, when v·d is positive (charge moving towards observer), denominator is smaller, making V larger. That's correct.

But earlier, when I compared the units, option C's units weren't matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Let me re-calculate the units for option C's V.

V in option C: ( q c ) / [ (4 π ε₀ ) ( c |d| - v·d ) ]

Units:

q: Coulombs (C)

c: m/s

ε₀: F/m = C²/(N·m²) → C²·s²/(kg·m³)

So, denominator: 4 π ε₀ has units of C²·s²/(kg·m³)

Multiply by (c |d| - v·d ), which has units of m.

So denominator's units: C²·s²/(kg·m³) * m = C²·s²/(kg·m²)

Numerator: q c → C * m/s

So V's units: ( C * m/s ) / ( C²·s²/(kg·m²) ) )

= ( kg·m² ) / ( C·s³ )

But 1 V has units kg·m²/(C·s³ ), so this matches.

Wait, yes! Because V = J/C, and J is kg·m²/s². So V has units kg·m²/(C·s³ ), which matches.

So option C's V has the correct units.

Similarly, let's check A's units in option C.

A in option C: ( μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π ( c |d| - v·d ) ]

μ₀: H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²) → kg·m/(s²·C² )

q: C

c: m/s

v: m/s

Denominator: same as before, units m.

So numerator: μ₀ q c v → ( kg·m/(s²·C²) ) * C * (m/s ) * (m/s )

= kg·m/(s²·C²) * C * m²/s²

= kg·m³/(s^4 · C )

Denominator: m

So A's units: ( kg·m³/(s^4 · C ) ) / m → kg·m²/(s^4 · C )

But vector potential A has units kg·m²/(s²·C ), because it's measured in Tesla·m² (since B is Tesla, which is kg/(s²·A), and A is ampere = C/s. So Tesla is kg/(s²·C) · m² → kg·m²/(s²·C) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The units for vector potential A should be Tesla·meter, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the units for A are Weber per meter squared? No, wait, Weber is Tesla·m². Hmm, perhaps I should just think in terms of the expression.

Wait, but let's compute the units for option C's A.

μ₀ has units of H/m → H is Wb/(A·m) → Wb is T·m², so H is T·m²/(A·m) ) → T·m/A.

So μ₀ is T·m/A per m → T/(A )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

μ₀ = 4 π ×1e-7 H/m → H is Wb/A (since inductance L has units H, and flux Φ is Wb = V·s = (J/C)·s = (kg·m²/s²)·s = kg·m²/s.

So Φ = Wb = kg·m²/s.

Thus, H = Wb/A = (kg·m²/s ) / (C/s ) ) → kg·m²/(C )

So μ₀ = 4π ×1e-7 H/m → (kg·m²/(C )) / m ) → kg·m/(C )

So μ₀ has units kg·m/(C )

So, back to A's units in option C:

μ₀ q c v → [ kg·m/(C ) ] * C * (m/s ) * (m/s )

= kg·m/(C ) * C * m²/s² → kg·m³/(s² )

Denominator: m

So A's units: ( kg·m³/s² ) / m → kg·m²/s²

Which isn't correct because A should have units of kg·m²/(C·s² ) → since it's a vector potential, which when multiplied by charge gives momentum etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me try again.

The vector potential A has units of kg·m²/(s²·C ), because it's related to the magnetic field B (kg/(s²·C )) via B = ∇ × A.

So, the correct units for A should be kg·m²/(s²·C )

Now, let's compute the units for option C's A.

Option C's A: ( μ₀ q c v ) / ( c |d| - v·d )

μ₀ has units kg·m/(s²·C² )

q: C

c: m/s

v: m/s

Denominator: m (since c |d| is m/s * m = m²/s * s → m. Wait, no, |d| is m, so c |d| is (m/s) * m = m²/s. Hmm, but that would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm messing up the units.

Wait, perhaps I should do this more carefully.

μ₀ → kg·m/(s²·A²) → since A is C/s, so A² = C²/s².

Thus, μ₀ → kg·m/(s² * (C²/s² )) ) → kg·m/(C² )

So, μ₀ q → ( kg·m/C² ) * C ) → kg·m/C.

c → m/s

v → m/s

So numerator: μ₀ q c v → ( kg·m/C ) * (m/s ) * (m/s ) → kg·m³/(C·s² )

Denominator: (c |d| - v ·d ) → (m/s * m ) - ( m/s * m ) → which is (m²/s ) - (m²/s ) → units are m²/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because the denominator must be a scalar. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, because |d| is a scalar in meters, c is m/s, so c |d| is (m/s ) * m → m²/s. Similarly, v ·d is (m/s ) * m → m²/s. So the denominator has units m²/s.

So, units of denominator: m²/s.

Thus, the units of option C's A are:

( kg·m³/(C·s² ) ) / ( m²/s ) ) → ( kg·m³/(C·s² ) ) * ( s / m² ) → kg·m·s/(C·s² ) → kg·m/(C·s )

Which simplifies to kg·m/(C·s ), which is (kg·m²/(C·s² )) ) * s/m → which isn't matching the required units for A.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me check another way.

The vector potential A has units Tesla·meter (T·m). Since Tesla is kg/(s²·A), and A is Coulombs per second (C/s), then Tesla is kg/(s²·(C/s)) )= kg·s/(C²).

So, T·m = kg·s/(C² ) * m = kg·m·s/(C² )

But the units of option C's A are kg·m/(C·s ), which is not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the unit analysis. Maybe I should move on.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option C, even though my earlier analysis suggested some discrepancies. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the derivation.

Considering that option C's V and A have the same denominator and structure, and that in the standard expressions, the potentials involve the velocity v and the distance d, I think option C is the correct answer.


To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options and compare them to the standard expressions for retarded potentials. The scalar potential \( V \) is influenced by the charge's motion, and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) depends on the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \). The denominator in both potentials involves the vector \( \vec{d} \), which represents the displacement from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and the velocity \( \vec{v} \).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \): This is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): This expression for \( \vec{A} \) is inconsistent because the vector potential should depend linearly on \( \vec{v} \), not \( \vec{v}^2 \).  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \): Again, this is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \): While this form for \( \vec{A} \) is dimensionally consistent, the static potential \( V \) is not valid for a moving charge.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This matches the structure of the retarded scalar potential, where the denominator includes the motion of the charge through the term \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): This matches the structure of the retarded vector potential, where \( \vec{A} \) depends linearly on \( \vec{v} \) and has the same denominator as \( V \).  
   **Conclusion**: Correct.

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): The denominator includes \( +\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is inconsistent with the retarded potential expressions, where the denominator should subtract \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \): Similar to \( V \), the denominator is incorrect.  
   **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Option C is the correct choice because it provides the correct forms for both the scalar and vector potentials, consistent with the retarded potential expressions for a moving charge.
