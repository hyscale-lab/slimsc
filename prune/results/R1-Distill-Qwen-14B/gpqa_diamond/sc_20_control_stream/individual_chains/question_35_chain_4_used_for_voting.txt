Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Oh right, angular momentum in quantum mechanics often involves Pauli matrices or spin matrices. Let me think.

The operator A_y is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, because the standard Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me write down the matrix S:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait a second, the standard Pauli Y matrix σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so S must be σ_y. Or wait, no, wait—actually, S is that. So then c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. Remember, the eigenvalues of a matrix are found from the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - λI) = 0.

But since σ_y is a Pauli matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±i. Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for σ_x and σ_z, but σ_y? Let me compute the eigenvalues of σ_y.

The matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The trace is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is 0. The determinant would be (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = -(-(-1)) = -1. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - Tr(A)λ + det(A) =0 → λ^2 - 0 + (-1) =0 → λ² = 1 → λ=±1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No, no. Let me compute the determinant again.

Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) → because i^2 is -1. So (-i)(i) is -i^2 = -(-1)=1. So the determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, that can't be. Because, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant for σ_y. Let me think: for σ_x, determinant is -1, same as σ_y and σ_z. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless, determinant is (trace^2 - trace of square)/2. Wait, maybe an easier way is to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy:

|σ_y - λ I| = 0 → (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = 0 → λ^2 - (-i)(i) = 0.

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) =1. So equation is λ^2 - (1) = 0 → λ^2 =1 → λ=±1. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are +1 and -1. But wait, I thought the eigenvalues were ±i. No, maybe I got confused with another matrix. Wait, no, σ_y is Hermitian, right? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So their eigenvalues should be real. So yes, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, but wait, let's actually compute. Suppose a vector [a, b] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ. Then σ_y [a; b] = λ [a; b].

So,

[0*a -i b; i a +0*b] = λ [a; b]

So equations:

- i b = λ a → (1)

i a = λ b → (2)

From equation (1): λ a = -i b. From equation (2): i a = λ b.

Let me express equation (2) as b = (i a)/λ.

Substitute into equation (1): λ a = -i (i a / λ) → λ a = (-i^2) a / λ → λ a = (1) a / λ. Assuming a ≠0,

λ^2 =1 → λ=±1.

So yes, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1.

Then, the operator Ay is (h/4π) * σ_y. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me think again. Because the operator is Ay = c S, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1, Ay has eigenvalues ±c → so (h/(4π)) * (±1).

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, the options talk about the eigenvalues. Let me check each option.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, real part +h/(4π) or –h/4π. Wait, but our eigenvalues are real, because S is Hermitian. So c times real numbers would still be real. So eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be.

Option B: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±1/2, real ±1. Wait, but the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So if h is Planck's constant (which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s), unless h is being considered as 1, but that's not the case here. So the eigenvalues are real, but their real parts are ±h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are zero. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with the components of A. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it should also be an eigenfunction of A² and Az? Or no? Wait, but in quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the angular momentum components don't commute with each other. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az because they don't share eigenstates. But does it mean that it is an eigenstate of A²? Because A² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The eigenfunctions are the basis for the space, but I think the term 'basis functions' here refers to the standard basis vectors. Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay would form an orthonormal basis for the space, but the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the matrix. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are the basis vectors. But I'm not certain. Let me think. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it'll have two eigenvectors (orthonormal) forming the basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So option D would be correct as well.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let's see each option again.

So, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect because they talk about non-zero imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since A² commutes with all components, if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it must be an eigenfunction of A². So yes, that part is correct. But can it be an eigenfunction of Az? No, because Ay and Az don't commute. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it can’t be an eigenstate of Az. So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors. Wait, the matrix is being represented in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis for the space. So option D would be correct, but I'm not so sure about the wording. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in its own eigenbasis. So in the standard basis, the matrix is represented as Ay, and the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form the basis. So perhaps option D is correct as well.

Wait, but the statement says 'the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions'—perhaps the basis functions refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So, when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form the basis, so φ are the basis functions. So I think option D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the statements in C and D.

So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, let me think about option D. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so when you have a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors (assuming they are two and orthogonal) form a basis. So the statement is correct. So option D would be correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So which options are possible.

Wait, the question says: during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So, the correct statements would be either C or D, but let me reexamine the options.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But it can't be an eigenfunction of Az because the components do not commute. So statement C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator's representation. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. So the question is which is correct.

Wait, but let's think about what the question is asking. It says, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct. So in the process of finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So, let's think about each statement.

Option A: Incorrect, eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Option B: Also incorrect, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), so neither 1 nor 1/2.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but the statement could be ambiguous.

Wait, but usually the standard basis is the computational basis, but the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the space regardless. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, it acts on a two-dimensional space, and the eigenfunctions form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but if the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, then the operator can be represented in that basis as a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal. That's correct.

So, statements C and D are both correct? But the options are exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking again:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

So, that's correct because A^2 commutes with Ay, which would mean that φ is an eigenfunction of A^2. But Az and Ay don't commute, so φ cannot be an eigenfunction of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the space, but the matrix operator is represented in some basis. For the given S matrix, which is σ_y, it's represented in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are eigenvectors in the standard basis, so they form the basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but in the given matrix S, the basis is probably the standard basis. So when you diagonalize S, the eigenvectors are the new basis. So, the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions in this new basis. So in the original standard basis, the eigenvectors are different.

Hmm, perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) serve as the basis for the matrix in its diagonal form. But the original matrix is in the standard basis. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, but only when considering the diagonal representation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of it another way. The matrix Ay is given in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions φ are vectors in that basis. If you diagonalize Ay, you're finding a new basis where Ay is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions form the basis for that diagonal representation. Therefore, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in its diagonal form. So perhaps option D is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is saying the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions (like standard basis vectors). But that's only if the eigenfunctions happen to be the standard basis vectors, which is not the case here.

Wait, the standard basis vectors are (1,0) and (0,1). Let me see what the eigenvectors are. Let's find the eigenvectors of σ_y.

For eigenvalue +1:

From σ_y |v> = +1 |v>

So [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So from equation (1): -i b = a.

Equation (2): i a = b.

Substituting a = -i b into equation (2): i (-i b) = b → ( -i² ) b = b → ( -(-1) )b = b → (1)b =b → always true. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i b; b ] = b [ -i ; 1 ].

So for eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly for eigenvalue -1, eigenvector proportional to [i, 1 ].

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors. So they are not the standard basis vectors, but they form an orthonormal basis themselves. So in this case, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the operator in its eigenbasis. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is correct because after diagonalizing, the basis is the eigenfunctions.

So both options C and D could be correct, but the problem must have only one correct option.

Wait, the question is, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

But looking back, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, if I'm calculating the eigenvalues, I know that the eigenvalues of S are ±1, so Ay would have eigenvalues ±c. So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong.

So options C and D are possible.

But the question is which statement is correct. So consider each statement again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0. So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

I think that's also correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the space, so the operator can be represented in terms of these eigenfunctions as a diagonal matrix. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are about which is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is only C. Because when solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis functions, so D is incorrect. Or maybe D is correct because they form the basis.

Wait, the wording in option D is a bit tricky. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. If the matrix is given as a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors are the basis functions in their own eigenbasis. So yes, in that basis, the matrix would be diagonal. So perhaps D is correct.

But looking back, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options only have one correct choice.

Wait, looking at the eigenvalues: the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenfunctions are real? No, wait, no. The eigenvectors are complex, as we saw earlier. So the eigenfunctions are complex.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So in the basis of the eigenfunctions, the matrix would be diagonal. So yes, D is correct.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π), real. So A and B are wrong.

Between C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps only one is correct. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are eigenvectors which are not the standard basis vectors. So the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

But the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the operator. No, the basis functions are the columns of the identity matrix. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a different basis.

Hmm, perhaps option D is incorrect. Because the basis functions of the matrix are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the matrix operator. So D's statement is incorrect.

Wait, but the matrix operator can be represented in any basis. So when you diagonalize it, the eigenfunctions become the basis. So in their own basis, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So the statement in D is correct.

But the way the statement is phrased: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So given above, the matrix is in the standard basis. So perhaps the statement is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the given matrix (which is in standard basis), but in another basis.

Hmm, perhaps D is incorrect. Then, the correct answer is C.

So, after this long thought process, I think the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y-matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.

2. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real, with no imaginary components.

3. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \).
   - This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Option C:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \).
   - This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

5. **Option D:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - This is ambiguous. While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, they are not the same as the standard basis functions in which \( A_y \) is represented. The eigenfunctions correspond to the eigenvectors of \( A_y \), which form a different basis when diagonalizing the operator. Thus, this statement is not strictly correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Oh right, angular momentum in quantum mechanics often involves Pauli matrices or spin matrices. Let me think.

The operator A_y is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, because the standard Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me write down the matrix S:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait a second, the standard Pauli Y matrix σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so S must be σ_y. Or wait, no, wait—actually, S is that. So then c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. Remember, the eigenvalues of a matrix are found from the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - λI) = 0.

But since σ_y is a Pauli matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±i. Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for σ_x and σ_z, but σ_y? Let me compute the eigenvalues of σ_y.

The matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The trace is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is 0. The determinant would be (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = -(-(-1)) = -1. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - Tr(A)λ + det(A) =0 → λ^2 - 0 + (-1) =0 → λ² = 1 → λ=±1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No, no. Let me compute the determinant again.

Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) → because i^2 is -1. So (-i)(i) is -i^2 = -(-1)=1. So the determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, that can't be. Because, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant for σ_y. Let me think: for σ_x, determinant is -1, same as σ_y and σ_z. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless, determinant is (trace^2 - trace of square)/2. Wait, maybe an easier way is to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy:

|σ_y - λ I| = 0 → (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = 0 → λ^2 - (-i)(i) = 0.

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) =1. So equation is λ^2 - (1) = 0 → λ^2 =1 → λ=±1. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are +1 and -1. But wait, I thought the eigenvalues were ±i. No, maybe I got confused with another matrix. Wait, no, σ_y is Hermitian, right? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So their eigenvalues should be real. So yes, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, but wait, let's actually compute. Suppose a vector [a, b] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ. Then σ_y [a; b] = λ [a; b].

So,

[0*a -i b; i a +0*b] = λ [a; b]

So equations:

- i b = λ a → (1)

i a = λ b → (2)

From equation (1): λ a = -i b. From equation (2): i a = λ b.

Let me express equation (2) as b = (i a)/λ.

Substitute into equation (1): λ a = -i (i a / λ) → λ a = (-i^2) a / λ → λ a = (1) a / λ. Assuming a ≠0,

λ^2 =1 → λ=±1.

So yes, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1.

Then, the operator Ay is (h/4π) * σ_y. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me think again. Because the operator is Ay = c S, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1, Ay has eigenvalues ±c → so (h/(4π)) * (±1).

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, the options talk about the eigenvalues. Let me check each option.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, real part +h/(4π) or –h/4π. Wait, but our eigenvalues are real, because S is Hermitian. So c times real numbers would still be real. So eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be.

Option B: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±1/2, real ±1. Wait, but the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So if h is Planck's constant (which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s), unless h is being considered as 1, but that's not the case here. So the eigenvalues are real, but their real parts are ±h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are zero. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with the components of A. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it should also be an eigenfunction of A² and Az? Or no? Wait, but in quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the angular momentum components don't commute with each other. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az because they don't share eigenstates. But does it mean that it is an eigenstate of A²? Because A² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The eigenfunctions are the basis for the space, but I think the term 'basis functions' here refers to the standard basis vectors. Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay would form an orthonormal basis for the space, but the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the matrix. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are the basis vectors. But I'm not certain. Let me think. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it'll have two eigenvectors (orthonormal) forming the basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So option D would be correct as well.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let's see each option again.

So, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect because they talk about non-zero imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since A² commutes with all components, if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it must be an eigenfunction of A². So yes, that part is correct. But can it be an eigenfunction of Az? No, because Ay and Az don't commute. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it can’t be an eigenstate of Az. So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors. Wait, the matrix is being represented in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis for the space. So option D would be correct, but I'm not so sure about the wording. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in its own eigenbasis. So in the standard basis, the matrix is represented as Ay, and the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form the basis. So perhaps option D is correct as well.

Wait, but the statement says 'the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions'—perhaps the basis functions refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So, when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form the basis, so φ are the basis functions. So I think option D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the statements in C and D.

So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, let me think about option D. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so when you have a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors (assuming they are two and orthogonal) form a basis. So the statement is correct. So option D would be correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So which options are possible.

Wait, the question says: during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So, the correct statements would be either C or D, but let me reexamine the options.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But it can't be an eigenfunction of Az because the components do not commute. So statement C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator's representation. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. So the question is which is correct.

Wait, but let's think about what the question is asking. It says, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct. So in the process of finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So, let's think about each statement.

Option A: Incorrect, eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Option B: Also incorrect, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), so neither 1 nor 1/2.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but the statement could be ambiguous.

Wait, but usually the standard basis is the computational basis, but the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the space regardless. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, it acts on a two-dimensional space, and the eigenfunctions form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but if the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, then the operator can be represented in that basis as a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal. That's correct.

So, statements C and D are both correct? But the options are exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking again:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

So, that's correct because A^2 commutes with Ay, which would mean that φ is an eigenfunction of A^2. But Az and Ay don't commute, so φ cannot be an eigenfunction of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the space, but the matrix operator is represented in some basis. For the given S matrix, which is σ_y, it's represented in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are eigenvectors in the standard basis, so they form the basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but in the given matrix S, the basis is probably the standard basis. So when you diagonalize S, the eigenvectors are the new basis. So, the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions in this new basis. So in the original standard basis, the eigenvectors are different.

Hmm, perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) serve as the basis for the matrix in its diagonal form. But the original matrix is in the standard basis. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, but only when considering the diagonal representation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of it another way. The matrix Ay is given in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions φ are vectors in that basis. If you diagonalize Ay, you're finding a new basis where Ay is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions form the basis for that diagonal representation. Therefore, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in its diagonal form. So perhaps option D is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is saying the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions (like standard basis vectors). But that's only if the eigenfunctions happen to be the standard basis vectors, which is not the case here.

Wait, the standard basis vectors are (1,0) and (0,1). Let me see what the eigenvectors are. Let's find the eigenvectors of σ_y.

For eigenvalue +1:

From σ_y |v> = +1 |v>

So [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So from equation (1): -i b = a.

Equation (2): i a = b.

Substituting a = -i b into equation (2): i (-i b) = b → ( -i² ) b = b → ( -(-1) )b = b → (1)b =b → always true. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i b; b ] = b [ -i ; 1 ].

So for eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly for eigenvalue -1, eigenvector proportional to [i, 1 ].

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors. So they are not the standard basis vectors, but they form an orthonormal basis themselves. So in this case, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the operator in its eigenbasis. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is correct because after diagonalizing, the basis is the eigenfunctions.

So both options C and D could be correct, but the problem must have only one correct option.

Wait, the question is, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

But looking back, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, if I'm calculating the eigenvalues, I know that the eigenvalues of S are ±1, so Ay would have eigenvalues ±c. So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong.

So options C and D are possible.

But the question is which statement is correct. So consider each statement again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0. So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

I think that's also correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the space, so the operator can be represented in terms of these eigenfunctions as a diagonal matrix. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are about which is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is only C. Because when solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis functions, so D is incorrect. Or maybe D is correct because they form the basis.

Wait, the wording in option D is a bit tricky. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. If the matrix is given as a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors are the basis functions in their own eigenbasis. So yes, in that basis, the matrix would be diagonal. So perhaps D is correct.

But looking back, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options only have one correct choice.

Wait, looking at the eigenvalues: the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenfunctions are real? No, wait, no. The eigenvectors are complex, as we saw earlier. So the eigenfunctions are complex.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So in the basis of the eigenfunctions, the matrix would be diagonal. So yes, D is correct.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π), real. So A and B are wrong.

Between C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps only one is correct. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are eigenvectors which are not the standard basis vectors. So the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

But the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the operator. No, the basis functions are the columns of the identity matrix. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a different basis.

Hmm, perhaps option D is incorrect. Because the basis functions of the matrix are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the matrix operator. So D's statement is incorrect.

Wait, but the matrix operator can be represented in any basis. So when you diagonalize it, the eigenfunctions become the basis. So in their own basis, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So the statement in D is correct.

But the way the statement is phrased: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So given above, the matrix is in the standard basis. So perhaps the statement is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the given matrix (which is in standard basis), but in another basis.

Hmm, perhaps D is incorrect. Then, the correct answer is C.

So, after this long thought process, I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y-matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.

2. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real, with no imaginary components.

3. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \).
   - This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Option C:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \).
   - This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

5. **Option D:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - This is ambiguous. While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, they are not the same as the standard basis functions in which \( A_y \) is represented. The eigenfunctions correspond to the eigenvectors of \( A_y \), which form a different basis when diagonalizing the operator. Thus, this statement is not strictly correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
