Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that we're analyzing a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks that are supposed to be from the same alpha-proton, but there are two peaks instead of one. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. Also, the coupling isn't the issue because the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as the expected compound. So, what's going on here?

Hmm. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. So if it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a peptide's precursor would be the previous step before the final product. But the mass spectra are the same, so maybe that's not it. Unless the precursor somehow has the same mass? No, I think the precursor would have a lower mass, so the mass spec would show a different m/z. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight. But in LC-MS, how would they show? Well, if you're using a chiral column, enantiomers would separate and show two peaks. But if the LC isn't chiral, they might co-elute. Wait, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. So maybe the LC is a chiral column, so they split. But in NMR, enantiomers would have the same NMR spectrum because they're identical in physical properties except for the direction of optical rotation. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So why are there two peaks in the NMR? Wait, the NMR says the same alpha-proton has two peaks. That suggests something else.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about this one. Double coupling might refer to some kind of coupling in the reaction, but I'm not sure how that would lead to two NMR peaks for the same proton. Alternatively, maybe during the formation of the amide bond, some double coupling leads to some splitting, but the question says coupling is ruled out. So maybe this isn't the case.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMRs would be different. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, each would have slightly different chemical shifts for some protons. But wait, the question says that the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So maybe the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, but different elsewhere. But why would the same proton split into two peaks?

Wait, another angle. If there's a diastereomer mixture, the same proton in each might have slightly different environments, leading to two peaks. But the question says the peaks have similar shifts. If the diastereomers are present but the alpha-proton's environment is the same in both, then why would the NMR show two peaks? Maybe because of different coupling constants? Or perhaps because in each diastereomer, the coupling pattern is different, but the question says coupling is ruled out. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the synthesis. Let me think about the LC-MS part. The MS shows two peaks of same mass, so same molecular weight. If the compound is a mixture, but same mass, that could be either enantiomers or diastereomers. But enantiomers have same mass, yes. Diastereomers also same mass. So why in the NMR would same proton split into two?

Wait, when diastereomers are present, each has different physical properties. So maybe the same proton in each diastereomer has a similar shift, but when in a mixture, you'd see a multiplet or a singlet, but perhaps in some cases, it could lead to two separate peaks if the shifts are close but not identical. But the question says the peaks have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H. So that sounds like each peak is 0.5H. So maybe each diastereomer contributes a peak.

Wait, but diastereomers have different physical properties, so if the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer has a similar chemical shift, then their peaks would be close but maybe split into two. But the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, so together 1H. If the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, each would contribute 0.5H, which might cause two peaks. But would that be the case?

Alternatively, maybe it's a singlet with two peaks close together, but the integral is 1H. But without coupling, why two peaks? Wait, isn't that due to some other splitting?

Wait, another possibility: the NMR is showing a doublet of doublets or something, but the coupling is ruled out. So perhaps if the proton has two different coupling partners, but in reality, the question says coupling is ruled out, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's about the presence of two diastereomers. Let's say the molecule has two stereocenters, and the synthesis led to a mixture of diastereomers. But perhaps the same alpha-proton is in a similar environment in each diastereomer, but the coupling is different. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a double bond. If the molecule has an alpha,beta-unsaturated amide, maybe the alpha-proton is split by coupling with the beta-proton. But again, the question says coupling isn't the issue. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same integral, similar shifts. So maybe the issue is not diastereomers but something else. Another possibility is that there's a byproduct or some other structure, but the same mass. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so same molecular formula.

Wait, another angle: the compound might have undergone some tautomerism. But that's more about different structures, which would change the shifts more. I don't think that's the case.

Let me think again about the options.

Option D is mixture of diastereoisomers. That would mean each has the same molecular formula but different physical properties. So in the NMR, each would contribute a peak. But if the same proton is present in both and in the same environment, why two peaks?

Wait, maybe the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer. So for diastereomer A, the alpha-proton is in one environment, giving a shift, and diastereomer B has a slightly different environment, another shift. But the shifts are similar, so the peaks are close. And since each diastereomer is present in equal amounts, each contributes 0.5H, so the integral is 1H. That makes sense.

In the LC-MS, if they are diastereomers, they would have different retention times but same mass. So two peaks of same mass, same intensity, which matches the LC-MS data.

So the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton (if each diastereomer has that proton) but with similar shifts. That fits the description.

So option D seems possible.

Wait, but what about option B, enantiomers? Enantiomers have same physical properties except optical activity. So in NMR, they would be identical. So the NMR would show a single peak for that proton, not two. So B is unlikely.

So then, the LC-MS would show two peaks if the column is chiral. But if it's a normal column, the enantiomers would co-elute. The question says they're using elevated temperature. Not sure if that affects retention times or peak shape, but perhaps if the column is chiral, the two would separate. But if the column isn't chiral, they'd be one peak.

In the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks. So if the column is chiral, then enantiomers would split into two. But then NMR would have same shifts, but would you see two peaks? No, because enantiomers have the same NMR shifts. So why two peaks in NMR?

Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So that suggests that the alpha-proton is split into two. If the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, which have different physical properties, the same proton in each diastereomer could have slightly different shifts, but if the shifts are very similar, you might see two peaks. So that could explain the NMR.

And in the LC-MS, diastereomers would have different retention times but same mass, hence two peaks of same mass but different RT.

So that supports option D.

Alternatively, if it's a mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would not show two peaks because the shifts are the same.

So the NMR observations point towards diastereomers. So the correct answer is D.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (adding up to 1H). The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum as the expected compound. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct mass spectrum in LC-MS. Since the mass spectra of the two peaks are identical, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images. Therefore, the NMR would show only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two. This rules out enantiomers as the explanation.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as a cause of the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" during synthesis is not a common or well-defined phenomenon that would explain the observed NMR and LC-MS data. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. In the LC-MS, this would result in two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum. In the NMR, the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer could experience slightly different chemical environments, leading to two peaks with similar shifts. The equal integrals (0.5H each) suggest the diastereomers are present in equal amounts. This explanation aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the duplicate peaks in the NMR and the two distinct peaks in the LC-MS with the same mass spectrum.
