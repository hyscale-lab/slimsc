Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects using optical telescopes. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. So, the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet range, I remember. But wait, when this is absorbed by neutral hydrogen, the quasar's light at that wavelength gets absorbed. So, when we observe this absorption, it's because the hydrogen is in a cloud that's moving away from us at a high velocity due to the expansion of the universe.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So, I think that the redshift determines whether the absorbed wavelength moves into the optical range that we can observe.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The quasar emits light, and when it passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, in the far ultraviolet. But if the cloud is moving away from us (which it is, because the universe is expanding), the wavelength gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength will be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

But optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because of the atmosphere; UV doesn't penetrate the atmosphere. So, for the absorption to be in the optical range, the redshift must shift the Lyman alpha line into something visible, like maybe around 400 nm or longer (since 400 nm is violet, the edge of optical).

So, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. We want the observed wavelength to be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can observe. I think the cutoff is about 400 nm (since beyond that is UV which doesn't reach the ground).

Wait, but wait. Actually, the optical range is roughly 400 nm (violet) to about 700 nm (red). So, the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted, needs to be in this range to be observed by optical telescopes. But wait, the absorption is in the quasar's spectrum. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), and the cloud is at redshift z, then the absorption line would be at 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar? Or is the quasar at a higher redshift? Hmm, wait, in the standard scenario, the quasar is at a higher redshift (farther away) than the intervening cloud. So when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud's hydrogen absorbs at its own rest wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So, the observed wavelength would be 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. So, because the quasar is at a higher redshift, the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's, but the cloud is still in front.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the cloud is in the line of sight to the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is further away. So the cloud is between us and the quasar. So, the quasar's light comes through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift. So, the cloud's own Lyman alpha absorption occurs at its rest wavelength, 1216 Angstroms, but because the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion), the observed wavelength is longer. So, the observed wavelength is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) Angstroms.

Wait, but the quasar is at redshift z_quasar, which is larger than z_cloud. But the absorption by the cloud happens at the cloud's own redshift. So the cloud's own Lyman alpha is 1216 Ang, and when observed, it's 1216*(1+z_cloud). So that absorption line would be in the quasar's spectrum at that wavelength, which we can observe if it's in the optical.

So, the question is, what is the minimum redshift z such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range. Because if the wavelength is longer than 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then it's in the optical. So, if 1216*(1+z) <= 4000 Angstroms (since 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is violet), then the wavelength is in the optical.

Wait, but if the wavelength is longer than 400 nm, it's in the visible. So, if 1216*(1+z) <= 4000 Angstroms, then the observed wavelength is <= 400 nm, which is violet, part of optical. So, let me compute (1+z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So, 1+z ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29. So, the minimum redshift is about 2.29. But wait, the options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9.

Wait, but I'm getting z ≈ 2.29, which is close to option C, which is 2.4. But wait, perhaps I should consider the edge of the optical spectrum. Maybe the maximum wavelength observed is a bit longer than 400 nm, like 430 or so. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the lower limit such that the line is in the optical, so the minimal redshift would be just enough to make the wavelength beyond the UV cutoff. So, if the wavelength is just below 400 nm, that's the minimal redshift. So, 1216 (1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms. Wait, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is the lower end of optical. So, that gives (1+z) = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.292. So z ≈ 2.292. So, about 2.29, which is just under option C (2.4). So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. So, the minimal z is just over 2.29.

But the options given are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So, 2.4 is option C. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is exactly 400 nm. So, the minimal redshift is the one that brings 1216 Ang to 4000 Ang (400 nm). So, the redshift z is 3.292-1=2.292. So, about 2.3.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal redshift would be 2.29, but perhaps the question is looking for the lower limit, so any object with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the smallest z is 2.29. So, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, but if z is 2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 Ang (400 nm), which is violet. If the redshift is higher than that, the observed wavelength is longer (more redshifted), moving into the red part of the visible spectrum. So, for example, a z of 3 would give lambda=1216*(4)=4864 Ang, which is 486 nm, green. That's well into the optical.

So the minimal redshift is 2.29. So, the lower limit is just above 2.29. So, if the question is about the lower limit (the minimum z for detection), then the redshift must be at least 2.29. So, among the options, the closest is option C, 2.4, as it's the first option above that value.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me check. The redshift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So, for the observed wavelength to be within the optical range (<= 4000 Ang), the minimal z is when lambda_obs=4000 Ang. So, z = (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ (3.29) -1 → 2.29.

So, any cloud with z >= 2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical (since higher z would make the wavelength longer, moving into the optical range). So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any object with z >=2.29 can be detected. The question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z is around 2.29, so the answer would be 2.4 (option C), but wait, option D is 1.9, which is less than 2.29. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the quasar's spectrum. Wait, no, the quasar's emission is at higher wavelengths, but the absorption is at the cloud's redshifted Lyman alpha.

Wait, another approach: the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Ang, but when the quasar's light passes through neutral hydrogen at redshift z, the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1+z) Ang. So, for that absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z) must be less than or equal to 4000 Ang (since 4000 Ang is 400 nm, the lower bound of optical).

Wait, no, 4000 Ang is 400 nm, which is violet, the lower end of optical. So, let's solve for z:

1216*(1+z) ≤ 4000 → (1+z) ≤ 4000/1216 → 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29 → 1+z ≤ 3.29 → z ≤ 2.29.

Wait, wait, no, that gives the upper limit on z? No, wait, no. Wait, if the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z), and we want it to be less than or equal to 4000 Ang (so that it's in the optical), then 1+z must be less than or equal to 4000/1216. So, 1+z ≤ ~3.29 → z ≤ 2.29.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption would be longer, moving into the optical. So, as z increases, 1216*(1+z) increases, moving into longer wavelengths.

So, the minimal z where the wavelength is just entering the optical (4000 Ang) is when 1216*(1+z) =4000 → z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29-1=2.29.

So, for any z >=2.29, the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical (since higher z gives longer wavelengths). So, the lower limit on the redshift is z=2.29. So, any cloud with z>=2.29 would have the absorption in the optical, so we can detect it. So, the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is around 2.3. So, the options are A)3 (3), B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So, 2.29 is between 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (D). So, the minimal is 2.29, so the lower limit is just above 2.29. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is higher than the calculated 2.29. So, the minimal redshift is approximately 2.3, so any z >=2.3 would be detectable. So, the lower limit is 2.3. So, the available options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). Since 2.3 is between D and C, but the question is about the lower limit, meaning the minimum z for detection. So, the minimal z is 2.29, meaning that the next higher option is C (2.4). So, the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: perhaps the cloud is at a redshift higher than the quasar? No, that can't be. The quasar is behind the cloud, so the quasar's redshift is higher. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So, the Lyman alpha absorption line is at (1+z_cloud) * 1216 Ang.

But if the cloud is at z_cloud =2.29, then the observed wavelength is 4000 Ang (400 nm), which is just in the optical. So, the minimal z is 2.29. So, the lower limit is 2.29, so any cloud with a redshift higher than that would have the absorption line in the optical. So, the minimal redshift is 2.29. So, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So, the minimal z is about 2.3, which is just below option C (2.4). So, the correct answer would be option C as the minimal redshift which is 2.4, but that's a bit higher than the exact calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm (UV cutoff). So, perhaps the Lyman alpha absorption line needs to be above 300 nm to be observed. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think.

Wait, the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV, except for some windows. The atmospheric window for UV observations is in the range of about 300-400 nm (near UV). So, if the Lyman alpha line is observed at 300 nm, that's 3000 Angstroms. So, 1216*(1+z) =3000 → (1+z)=3000/1216 ≈ 2.466 → z≈1.466. So, z=1.466. So, if the cloud's redshift is higher than 1.466, the observed wavelength would be longer than 300 nm, which is in the near UV. But since ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (as the atmosphere blocks it), any cloud with z>1.466 would have the Lyman alpha absorption line in the 300-400 nm range, which is just beyond the cutoff.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The visible spectrum is 400-700 nm. The near UV is about 300-400 nm. So, if the observed wavelength is in the near UV (300-400 nm), ground-based telescopes can observe it, but for wavelengths below 300 nm, it's blocked. So, to have the Lyman alpha line observed, the redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z) >=3000 Ang (300 nm). So, 1+z >=3000/1216 ≈2.466 → z >=1.466. So, any cloud with z>=1.466 would have the Lyman alpha absorption in the 300-400 nm range, which is observed from the ground.

Wait, but wait, that's a lower redshift than the previous calculation. So, if the cloud is at z=1.466, the observed wavelength is 3000 Ang (300 nm), which is the lower end of the near UV. So, the minimal z for detection would be about 1.466. So, looking at the options, option B is 1.2, which is below 1.466, so not sufficient. Option D is 1.9, which is below 1.466? No, 1.9 is higher than 1.466. So, if the minimal z is 1.466, then any cloud with z>=1.466 can be detected. So, the lower limit on z is 1.466. So, looking at the options, the next higher option is B)1.2? No, wait, D is 1.9, which is larger than 1.466. So, perhaps the minimal z is 1.466, so any cloud with z >=1.466 can be detected, so the lower limit is z=1.466. So, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Let me clarify. The question is: what is the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud) such that it can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. So, the detection is based on the Lyman alpha absorption line being in the optical (visible) range. Wait, but wait: Lyman alpha is at 1216 Ang, which is UV. When the cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorption line is observed at a longer wavelength.

So, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Ang. For this to be in the visible (400-700 nm), which is 4000-7000 Ang. So, 4000 <=1216*(1+z) <=7000 → 4000/1216 <=1+z <=7000/1216 → 3.29 <=1+z <=5.759 → z between 2.29 and 4.759.

So, the minimal redshift is 2.29. So, any cloud with z >=2.29 would have the Lyman alpha absorption in the visible (optical) range. So, objects with z >=2.29 can be detected.

But wait, another angle: the quasar's light is redshifted as well. The quasar itself is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Ang, but when observed, it's at 1216*(1+z_quasar) Ang. But the absorption is from the intervening cloud, which is at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_quasar). The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang. So, for this absorption line to be observed in the optical, it must be between 4000 and 7000 Ang.

So, the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1+z_cloud) =4000 → z_cloud= (4000/1216)-1 ≈2.29. So, the lower limit on the redshift is 2.29. So, any cloud with z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So, the lower limit is z=2.29. So, the correct answer would be the option just above this, which is option C)2.4, as the other options are either too high or too low.

Wait, but option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so that cloud's Lyman alpha would be at 1216*(1+1.9)= 1216 *2.9 = 3526.4 Ang, which is 352.64 nm, which is in the UV (since below 400 nm). So, ground-based telescopes can't observe that, as it's blocked by the atmosphere. So, the cloud must have z >=2.29 for the absorption line to be in the optical (4000 Ang or higher). So, the lower limit is 2.29, so the answer would be option C)2.4.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So, the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift, so the minimal z is 2.29. So, among the options, the nearest higher value is C)2.4. So, the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the relationship between the rest wavelength, the observed wavelength, and redshift. The observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \), and the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must lie within the optical range, which corresponds to approximately \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (400 nm, the lower bound of the optical spectrum). Substituting these values:

\[
4000 = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \approx 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Any cloud with a redshift greater than or equal to this value will have its Lyman alpha absorption line in the optical range, making it detectable with ground-based telescopes.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit of \( 2.29 \), so it is valid but not the minimal redshift.
- **B) 1.2**: This is below \( 2.29 \), so it would result in the Lyman alpha line being in the ultraviolet (UV), which cannot be detected by ground-based telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly above the calculated lower limit of \( 2.29 \), making it the closest valid option.
- **D) 1.9**: This is below \( 2.29 \), so it would also result in the Lyman alpha line being in the UV, which cannot be detected.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( 2.29 \), and the closest option provided is **C) 2.4**.

Answer: C
