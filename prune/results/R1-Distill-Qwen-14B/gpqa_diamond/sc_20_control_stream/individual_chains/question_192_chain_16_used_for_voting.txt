Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when a charge is inside a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor's surfaces. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, right? So initially, there are no net charges on the conductor. When the +q charge is placed inside the cavity, it's an enclosed charge. 

In a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is neutral, the induced charges must balance the enclosed charge. I think the induced charges will be on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Wait, how does that work?

Oh right! When a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface must have a -q charge, because the +q inside the cavity attracts opposite charges. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must then have a +q charge to balance that.

Wait, let me clarify. The conductor as a whole is neutral, so if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. 

But wait, the cavity's center is offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is not at the center of the conductor. Does that matter? Because the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is off-center. So the induced charges on the inner surface won't be symmetrically distributed anymore.

Wait, no, the inner surface of the conductor must be an equipotential surface because it's a conductor. But the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution that's asymmetric. However, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, I think the outer surface's charge distribution is what matters.

Wait, I remember Gauss's Law. For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface. So the Gaussian surface here would be a sphere of radius L, which is larger than R. The total enclosed charge would be the sum of the charge inside the cavity and the charge on the conductor. But the conductor was initially neutral, right?

Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. The +q inside the cavity induces a -q on the inner surface and a +q on the outer surface. So when you consider the outer surface, the charge is +q. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface (at radius L) is q (from the cavity) plus the conductor's charge. Wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral, so the sum of its inner and outer charges is zero. So the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface (which includes the cavity and the conductor) is just q. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, and the cavity has +q.

So applying Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) should be the same as if all the charge q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because the field depends only on the total enclosed charge and the symmetry. So even though the cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge distribution is such that from the outside, it looks like the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, but the charge inside the cavity is at a distance s away from the conductor's center. So, does that affect the electric field at P? Because the charge's position is not at the center, but the conductor's outer surface is symmetric?

Hmm, no. Wait, because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface will have a symmetric charge distribution regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. Wait, no, that's not right. If the charge inside is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be asymmetric, but the outer surface would still be symmetric because the conductor's outer surface must remain an equipotential. Oh, wait, no! Wait, I think I might have messed up.

Wait, here's the thing: when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface's charge distribution is such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. That requires that the inner surface's charge exactly cancels the field from the enclosed charge. So the inner surface's charge distribution will be such that inside the conductor, the field is zero.

But the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the fact that the conductor is neutral. So the outer surface must have a charge equal to the net charge inside the cavity. So in this case, the outer surface has +q because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor is neutral.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform? No, wait, only if the enclosed charge is at the center. If the enclosed charge is off-center, does the outer surface's charge distribution remain uniform?

Wait, no. If the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform. But the outer surface's charge distribution might still be uniform because the conductor is a sphere, and any asymmetry in the inner surface would cause the outer surface to adjust to maintain symmetry. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the electric field outside the conductor only depends on the total charge outside, which in this case is +q. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the external field would be the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the position of the charge inside the cavity would affect the field at a point outside, depending on where the point is. Or does it?

Wait, no, because the conductor's outer surface must have a symmetric charge distribution. Because the conductor is a sphere, any charge on the outer surface will distribute uniformly. So the charge +q on the outer surface would distribute uniformly regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is. So the field outside would be as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

In that case, the electric field at point P would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because the distance from the center is L.

Wait, but the options don't all have L² in the denominator. Let me check the options again.

Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to align with what I thought.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the charge inside the cavity is at a distance s away. So l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the distance between P and the cavity's center is l, and the vector from the conductor's center to the cavity's center is s. So the distance between P and the conductor's center is L, and the distance between P and the cavity's center is l. The angle between s and l is theta.

Wait, but if the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is q, then the field at P should be as if q is at the center of the conductor. So the direction would be along the line from the conductor's center to P, and the magnitude would be q/(4πε₀ L²).

So that would make option B correct.

But why are the other options considering l, s, and theta? Maybe I'm missing something. Could the presence of the cavity's center being offset affect the electric field outside?

Wait, no. Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor, which is +q. The position of that charge's origin (the cavity) doesn't matter. So the field outside is as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor.

So yes, the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$). The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key analysis:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material) and a charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor (to maintain the conductor's neutrality).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total enclosed charge within a Gaussian surface of radius $L$. The total charge enclosed is $+q$ (from the cavity) because the conductor itself is neutral. The position of the charge inside the cavity (offset by $s$) does not affect the external field, as the outer surface of the conductor ensures a uniform charge distribution.

3. **Gauss's Law**: Using Gauss's Law, the electric field at point $P$ is determined by the total enclosed charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The field is radial and has a magnitude:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of Other Options**: The other options involve $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are unnecessary because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The offset of the cavity does not affect the external field.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
