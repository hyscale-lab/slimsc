Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Then, calculate how much NaOH is needed at 25% titration and at equivalence, and use that to find the pH.

Wait, so when they dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, that's a 1:1 dilution. So the new volume is 40 cm³, right? The moles of acetic acid would remain the same as before dilution. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution, the concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which has a concentration of 0.1 M. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is a neutralization: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. So initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

The volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence can be found using Molarity = moles / volume. Rearranging, volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about 25% titration and equivalence. So for 25%, that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but when we are doing the titration, the solution being titrated is the diluted acetic acid (0.025 M, 40 cm³). So for each step, I need to calculate the concentrations and find the pH.

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O

So, the initial concentrations before adding NaOH:

In 40 cm³ (0.04 L) solution, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have reacted with NaOH. So moles remaining of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, when we add NaOH, the volume increases. Because we added 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is around 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, 2e-5 is about 4.7, but 1.85 is closer to log(1.85)=0.267, so 4.733 or something).

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 for the first part. That seems close.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate ions at equivalence are 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid has reacted). The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH volume (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction can be treated using the approximation method. Let's set up the equation:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] concentration produced. So:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, 5.405e-10 ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again. Wait, 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = ?

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 * 5.405e-10 = (2 *5.405) e-12 = 10.81e-12 → 1.081e-11. So sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98, so pH is around 9.02?

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH near 9.02. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Wait, I might have miscalculated. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73.

But for Kb, correct formula is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 5.405e-10. That part seems right.

Wait, but wait. When you prepare the sodium acetate solution, you must consider that sodium comes from a strong base, so it doesn't hydrolyze. So the acetate ions are the only source of OH-.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the pH using the formula for a weak base.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

The formula for pH is pOH = (pKb - log C)/2 + pOH, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the OH- concentration can be found using the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, as before. So pOH is ~4.98 → pH 9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second! Wait, what is the actual equivalence point. Wait, when you titrate acetic acid with NaOH, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so you have the conjugate base. That's correct.

But wait, wait, the solution made is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic, as the acetate ion is a weak base.

Looking back at the options, option D says equivalence point pH is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right. Option A is 8.52, which is basic.

But wait, my calculation gave pH around 9.02, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the solution.

Wait, when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, let's set up the equation using the exact expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume x is [OH^-] and [CH3COOH] = x. So:

5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, but let's check the options again. The options for equivalence point are:

A) 8.52

D) 6.92

Wait, none of them are close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, wait a second. Did I correctly calculate the moles of acetate?

Wait, the initial acetic acid is 0.05 M in 20 cm³ → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Then, at equivalence, all 0.001 moles have reacted with NaOH. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 moles. The volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe the Kb was miscalculated. Let me recheck that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = 4.73? Wait, no. Wait, pKa is the negative logarithm. So log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. So that part is correct.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution when adding NaOH? No, because the solution's volume is accounted for in the concentration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH-]. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.02 M acetate, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02) → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, which is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04) is approximately 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) = 0.017 -5 = -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983. pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017.

Still around 9.02. But the options don't have this. So perhaps there's an error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles, which reacts with 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

So moles of acetate are 0.001, correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not 50 cm³? Wait, 40 cm³ solution plus 10 cm³ NaOH, so 50 cm³. Yes.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as a buffer at equivalence.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

Wait, could the problem be that I forgot that the solution is sodium acetate, but sodium ions come from a strong base, so they don't affect the pH. So the acetate ions are the only contributors.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M is incorrect. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in 0.05 L (50 cm³) → 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem, I think.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% point.

Wait, at 25% titration, we added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. So moles of CH3COOH neutralized: 0.00025. Moles remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = ~0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = ~0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.73.

Ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Option A is 4.26 at 25%, which would be close.

But the equivalence point I calculated was around 9.02, which isn't an option. So perhaps I messed up somewhere else.

Wait, another approach: for the equivalence point, perhaps the solution is considered as a buffer, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base.

Wait, another way to calculate pH at equivalence is to consider the hydrolysis of acetate. So the solution is acetate ion in water.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M.

So, let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x; [CH3COOH] = x; [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the user has a typo in the problem statement? Like the volumes or concentrations?

Wait, no, the problem says 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume 40 cm³, 0.025 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence point calculation is supposed to be calculated using the initial concentration before dilution?

Wait, no, because the dilution has already happened. The titration is of the diluted solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001. So NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So equivalence point is 10 cm³ NaOH.

Wait, but the problem says to find pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the way to equivalence point is 2.5 cm³.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of sodium acetate.

Wait, another approach: calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

But at equivalence point, [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the HA is converted to A^-. So [HA] is zero, but that's not possible because some will hydrolyze.

Wait, but I think I should proceed with the Kb approach again.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the Kb calculation. Let's compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 again.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405.

So 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

Wait, but another way: the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2 ?

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for a weak base:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C )

Wait, let me think. For a weak base, the concentration is C, and the expression is:

Kb = [OH^-]^2 / (C - [OH^-])

Assuming [OH^-] is small, so C ≈ ( [OH^-]^2 ) / Kb → [OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Which brings us back to the same result. So pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, original acetic acid is 20 cm³ 0.05 M → 0.001 moles. Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial acetic acid solution is 0.05 M, 20 cm³, so 0.001 moles. Then when diluted to 40 cm³, it's 0.025 M. So when we add 20 cm³ of water, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps someone else has a different approach, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation for the 25% titration.

Wait, [A^-] is 0.00025 moles in 42.5 cm³ → 0.00025 /0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

So pH = pKa + log (0.333) = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. Close to option A's 4.26.

But the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is lower than my calculated 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base:

OH^- = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which gives OH^- = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximation.

So, let's not approximate and set up the equation:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02. But perhaps x isn't that negligible, so let's solve the quadratic equation.

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since the first term is much smaller).

sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.575e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] /2.

Take the positive root: (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2 ≈6.575e-6 /2 ≈3.2875e-6.

So x≈3.2875e-6 M.

Wait, that's different from the previous approximation. Wait, why did this happen?

Wait, because when I assumed x is small, I neglected the term, but in reality, 5.405e-10 is so small that x² is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So perhaps the initial approximation was correct.

Wait, but with the quadratic, x is about 3.2875e-6. So [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Oh! Wait a minute, that's different. So earlier, when I used the approximation x² = Kb*C, I found x=1.04e-5. But when solving the quadratic, I get x=3.2875e-6, which is smaller. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Because Kb*C is 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11; so x²=1.081e-11, x is ~1.04e-5.

But solving the quadratic, I get x=3.28e-6, which is much smaller. That suggests that the approximation where 0.02 -x ≈0.02 is not valid, which doesn't make sense because 3.28e-6 is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [ -b + sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Compute b²: (5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) =-4.324e-11.

So the discriminant is 2.921e-19 + (-4.324e-11) ?

Wait, no, wait, the discriminant is b² -4ac. But in this equation, it's x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So the discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) is ~6.575e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] / 2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ) / 2 ≈ (6.575e-6) /2 =3.2875e-6.

Wait, but that's a much smaller x than the initial approximation. So wait, why is this different?

Ah, I think confusion arises because the Kb is small, but in this case, perhaps the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is incorrect. Let me recompute.

Wait, x is 3.2875e-6, which is 0.00032875% of 0.02 (which is 2% → 0.02 is 20000 mM). So 3.2875e-6 is 0.0032875 mM. So compared to 20 mM (0.02 M), it's negligible. Therefore, the approximation holds, and x ≈ sqrt(Kb*C) is correct.

Wait, but in the quadratic solution, x is 3.28e-6, which is different from the initial approximation of 1.04e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt( Kb * C ) again. Kb =5.405e-10, C=0.02.

5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5 M.

But the quadratic solution gives x=3.28e-6. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the quadratic equation.

Wait, the equation is Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x). So Kb*(0.02 -x) =x^2 → 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x)=x^2.

Which gives 5.405e-10 *0.02 -5.405e-10 x =x^2 → 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x =x^2 → x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Yes, that's correct.

So the quadratic solution is correct, and the x is 3.2875e-6. But that's conflicting with the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should plug the value back into the equation to check.

Compute Kb = x²/(0.02 -x).

x=3.2875e-6 → x²= (3.2875e-6)^2 =1.0809e-11.

0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So Kb ≈1.0809e-11/0.02=5.4045e-10. Which matches the given Kb. So the calculation is correct.

So [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.2875e-6) ≈5.48.

pH=14 -5.48=8.52.

Ah! So that's why option A says equivalence pH is 8.52.

But wait, earlier when I used the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5, leading to pH=9.02, but with the exact calculation, it's x=3.2875e-6, pH=8.52.

So why the difference? Because the initial assumption that x is small enough to neglect was incorrect? No, because x is 3.28e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting calculations here. Let me try to compute [OH^-] using the exact quadratic solution.

Wait, with x=3.2875e-6, [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence is 8.52, matching option A.

But earlier, using the approximation, I got pH=9.02.

What's the reason for this discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Wait, the approximation x << C is valid because x=3.28e-6 is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold, but in reality, the exact solution gives a much smaller x. That's a contradiction.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another approach: using the exact solution without approximation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] )

Wait, no, because at equivalence, [acid] is zero, which complicates things. So perhaps it's better to go back to the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [OH^-] using the exact expression.

Wait, Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

x is 3.2875e-6, as per quadratic solution.

So [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So why did the approximation give a different result?

Wait, no. Wait, the approximation assumes x is negligible, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. But when you compute using the exact solution, x is 3.2875e-6, which is 0.0032875 mM, while 0.02 is 20 mM. So 0.02 -x is 19.99967 mM, which is still approximately 0.02. So the approximation should hold.

But in reality, when I plug x=3.2875e-6 into the equation, Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, let's compute using x=3.2875e-6:

x² = (3.2875e-6)^2 = 1.0809e-11.

0.02 -x = 0.02 -3.2875e-6 ≈0.0199967125.

So Kb = 1.0809e-11 / 0.0199967125 ≈5.405e-10, which matches.

So why does the quadratic solution give a different x compared to the approximation?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my earlier approximation. Let me recompute.

Wait, initial assumption: Kb = x²/(C) → x= sqrt( Kb * C )

So x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

But when solving the quadratic, x is 3.2875e-6. So that's a significant difference. That suggests that the initial approximation is not valid, which can't be true because x is much smaller than C.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the quadratic solution.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b² +4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)(1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11=4.324e-11 (approx).

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] /2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2.

Which is approximately (6.575e-6)/2 =3.2875e-6.

So the correct x is 3.2875e-6.

So why is the approximation x= sqrt(Kb*C) giving a higher x?

Because perhaps the approximation is only valid when Kb is very small and C is not too small. Hmm.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, I'm getting two different values for x. One from the approximation, and another from the quadratic solution. But they shouldn't be different if the approximation is valid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, another approach is to make a table.

Let me try to compute the exact x.

Let’s say [OH^-] = x.

The expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

We can rearrange this as x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Which is x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / (2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) =2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 =4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] /2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6) /2 →3.2875e-6.

Which is approximately 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A.

But earlier, when I approximated using x= sqrt(Kb*C), I got x=1.04e-5, which leads to pH=9.02. But this is incorrect because the quadratic solution shows that the correct x is 3.28e-6.

Wait, so why did the initial approximation give a wrong result?

Because when Kb is not extremely small compared to C, the approximation might not hold. But in this case, 5.405e-10 is very small compared to 0.02, so the approximation should hold.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of Kb*C.

Wait, Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02.

5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.28e-6, which is less than 1.04e-5. So why the discrepancy?

Wait a minute, perhaps I mixed up the Kb and Kw somewhere.

No, Kw is 1e-14, Kb=Kw/Ka=5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact solution, which gives pH=8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

So the correct option would be A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but earlier, for the 25% point, I calculated pH≈4.25, which matches option A's 4.26.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4.26 at 25%, and 8.52 at equivalence.

But why earlier when I thought the equivalence pH was 9.02 didn't match. Ah, because I forgot to account for the exact solution and assumed the approximation holds, which it didn't, leading to a calculation error.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially present are 0.001, so 25% of these moles is:

\[
\text{Moles reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles unreacted} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are equal to the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.00025 moles. The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{C} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \) and \( C = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot C = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.2875 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.2875 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

Thus, the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. 

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Then, calculate how much NaOH is needed at 25% titration and at equivalence, and use that to find the pH.

Wait, so when they dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, that's a 1:1 dilution. So the new volume is 40 cm³, right? The moles of acetic acid would remain the same as before dilution. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution, the concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which has a concentration of 0.1 M. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is a neutralization: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. So initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

The volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence can be found using Molarity = moles / volume. Rearranging, volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about 25% titration and equivalence. So for 25%, that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but when we are doing the titration, the solution being titrated is the diluted acetic acid (0.025 M, 40 cm³). So for each step, I need to calculate the concentrations and find the pH.

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O

So, the initial concentrations before adding NaOH:

In 40 cm³ (0.04 L) solution, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have reacted with NaOH. So moles remaining of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, when we add NaOH, the volume increases. Because we added 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is around 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, 2e-5 is about 4.7, but 1.85 is closer to log(1.85)=0.267, so 4.733 or something).

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 for the first part. That seems close.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate ions at equivalence are 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid has reacted). The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH volume (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction can be treated using the approximation method. Let's set up the equation:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] concentration produced. So:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, 5.405e-10 ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again. Wait, 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = ?

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 * 5.405e-10 = (2 *5.405) e-12 = 10.81e-12 → 1.081e-11. So sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98, so pH is around 9.02?

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH near 9.02. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Wait, I might have miscalculated. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73.

But for Kb, correct formula is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 5.405e-10. That part seems right.

Wait, but wait. When you prepare the sodium acetate solution, you must consider that sodium comes from a strong base, so it doesn't hydrolyze. So the acetate ions are the only source of OH-.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the pH using the formula for a weak base.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

The formula for pH is pOH = (pKb - log C)/2 + pOH, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the OH- concentration can be found using the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, as before. So pOH is ~4.98 → pH 9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second! Wait, what is the actual equivalence point. Wait, when you titrate acetic acid with NaOH, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so you have the conjugate base. That's correct.

But wait, wait, the solution made is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic, as the acetate ion is a weak base.

Looking back at the options, option D says equivalence point pH is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right. Option A is 8.52, which is basic.

But wait, my calculation gave pH around 9.02, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the solution.

Wait, when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, let's set up the equation using the exact expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume x is [OH^-] and [CH3COOH] = x. So:

5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, but let's check the options again. The options for equivalence point are:

A) 8.52

D) 6.92

Wait, none of them are close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, wait a second. Did I correctly calculate the moles of acetate?

Wait, the initial acetic acid is 0.05 M in 20 cm³ → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Then, at equivalence, all 0.001 moles have reacted with NaOH. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 moles. The volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe the Kb was miscalculated. Let me recheck that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = 4.73? Wait, no. Wait, pKa is the negative logarithm. So log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. So that part is correct.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution when adding NaOH? No, because the solution's volume is accounted for in the concentration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH-]. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.02 M acetate, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02) → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, which is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04) is approximately 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) = 0.017 -5 = -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983. pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017.

Still around 9.02. But the options don't have this. So perhaps there's an error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles, which reacts with 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

So moles of acetate are 0.001, correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not 50 cm³? Wait, 40 cm³ solution plus 10 cm³ NaOH, so 50 cm³. Yes.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as a buffer at equivalence.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

Wait, could the problem be that I forgot that the solution is sodium acetate, but sodium ions come from a strong base, so they don't affect the pH. So the acetate ions are the only contributors.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M is incorrect. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in 0.05 L (50 cm³) → 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem, I think.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% point.

Wait, at 25% titration, we added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. So moles of CH3COOH neutralized: 0.00025. Moles remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = ~0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = ~0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.73.

Ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Option A is 4.26 at 25%, which would be close.

But the equivalence point I calculated was around 9.02, which isn't an option. So perhaps I messed up somewhere else.

Wait, another approach: for the equivalence point, perhaps the solution is considered as a buffer, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base.

Wait, another way to calculate pH at equivalence is to consider the hydrolysis of acetate. So the solution is acetate ion in water.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M.

So, let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x; [CH3COOH] = x; [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the user has a typo in the problem statement? Like the volumes or concentrations?

Wait, no, the problem says 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume 40 cm³, 0.025 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence point calculation is supposed to be calculated using the initial concentration before dilution?

Wait, no, because the dilution has already happened. The titration is of the diluted solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001. So NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So equivalence point is 10 cm³ NaOH.

Wait, but the problem says to find pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the way to equivalence point is 2.5 cm³.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of sodium acetate.

Wait, another approach: calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

But at equivalence point, [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the HA is converted to A^-. So [HA] is zero, but that's not possible because some will hydrolyze.

Wait, but I think I should proceed with the Kb approach again.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the Kb calculation. Let's compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 again.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405.

So 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

Wait, but another way: the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2 ?

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for a weak base:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C )

Wait, let me think. For a weak base, the concentration is C, and the expression is:

Kb = [OH^-]^2 / (C - [OH^-])

Assuming [OH^-] is small, so C ≈ ( [OH^-]^2 ) / Kb → [OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Which brings us back to the same result. So pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, original acetic acid is 20 cm³ 0.05 M → 0.001 moles. Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial acetic acid solution is 0.05 M, 20 cm³, so 0.001 moles. Then when diluted to 40 cm³, it's 0.025 M. So when we add 20 cm³ of water, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps someone else has a different approach, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation for the 25% titration.

Wait, [A^-] is 0.00025 moles in 42.5 cm³ → 0.00025 /0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

So pH = pKa + log (0.333) = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. Close to option A's 4.26.

But the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is lower than my calculated 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base:

OH^- = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which gives OH^- = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximation.

So, let's not approximate and set up the equation:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02. But perhaps x isn't that negligible, so let's solve the quadratic equation.

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since the first term is much smaller).

sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.575e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] /2.

Take the positive root: (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2 ≈6.575e-6 /2 ≈3.2875e-6.

So x≈3.2875e-6 M.

Wait, that's different from the previous approximation. Wait, why did this happen?

Wait, because when I assumed x is small, I neglected the term, but in reality, 5.405e-10 is so small that x² is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So perhaps the initial approximation was correct.

Wait, but with the quadratic, x is about 3.2875e-6. So [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Oh! Wait a minute, that's different. So earlier, when I used the approximation x² = Kb*C, I found x=1.04e-5. But when solving the quadratic, I get x=3.2875e-6, which is smaller. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Because Kb*C is 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11; so x²=1.081e-11, x is ~1.04e-5.

But solving the quadratic, I get x=3.28e-6, which is much smaller. That suggests that the approximation where 0.02 -x ≈0.02 is not valid, which doesn't make sense because 3.28e-6 is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [ -b + sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Compute b²: (5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) =-4.324e-11.

So the discriminant is 2.921e-19 + (-4.324e-11) ?

Wait, no, wait, the discriminant is b² -4ac. But in this equation, it's x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So the discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) is ~6.575e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] / 2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ) / 2 ≈ (6.575e-6) /2 =3.2875e-6.

Wait, but that's a much smaller x than the initial approximation. So wait, why is this different?

Ah, I think confusion arises because the Kb is small, but in this case, perhaps the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is incorrect. Let me recompute.

Wait, x is 3.2875e-6, which is 0.00032875% of 0.02 (which is 2% → 0.02 is 20000 mM). So 3.2875e-6 is 0.0032875 mM. So compared to 20 mM (0.02 M), it's negligible. Therefore, the approximation holds, and x ≈ sqrt(Kb*C) is correct.

Wait, but in the quadratic solution, x is 3.28e-6, which is different from the initial approximation of 1.04e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt( Kb * C ) again. Kb =5.405e-10, C=0.02.

5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5 M.

But the quadratic solution gives x=3.28e-6. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the quadratic equation.

Wait, the equation is Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x). So Kb*(0.02 -x) =x^2 → 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x)=x^2.

Which gives 5.405e-10 *0.02 -5.405e-10 x =x^2 → 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x =x^2 → x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Yes, that's correct.

So the quadratic solution is correct, and the x is 3.2875e-6. But that's conflicting with the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should plug the value back into the equation to check.

Compute Kb = x²/(0.02 -x).

x=3.2875e-6 → x²= (3.2875e-6)^2 =1.0809e-11.

0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So Kb ≈1.0809e-11/0.02=5.4045e-10. Which matches the given Kb. So the calculation is correct.

So [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.2875e-6) ≈5.48.

pH=14 -5.48=8.52.

Ah! So that's why option A says equivalence pH is 8.52.

But wait, earlier when I used the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5, leading to pH=9.02, but with the exact calculation, it's x=3.2875e-6, pH=8.52.

So why the difference? Because the initial assumption that x is small enough to neglect was incorrect? No, because x is 3.28e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting calculations here. Let me try to compute [OH^-] using the exact quadratic solution.

Wait, with x=3.2875e-6, [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence is 8.52, matching option A.

But earlier, using the approximation, I got pH=9.02.

What's the reason for this discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Wait, the approximation x << C is valid because x=3.28e-6 is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold, but in reality, the exact solution gives a much smaller x. That's a contradiction.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another approach: using the exact solution without approximation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] )

Wait, no, because at equivalence, [acid] is zero, which complicates things. So perhaps it's better to go back to the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [OH^-] using the exact expression.

Wait, Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

x is 3.2875e-6, as per quadratic solution.

So [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So why did the approximation give a different result?

Wait, no. Wait, the approximation assumes x is negligible, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. But when you compute using the exact solution, x is 3.2875e-6, which is 0.0032875 mM, while 0.02 is 20 mM. So 0.02 -x is 19.99967 mM, which is still approximately 0.02. So the approximation should hold.

But in reality, when I plug x=3.2875e-6 into the equation, Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, let's compute using x=3.2875e-6:

x² = (3.2875e-6)^2 = 1.0809e-11.

0.02 -x = 0.02 -3.2875e-6 ≈0.0199967125.

So Kb = 1.0809e-11 / 0.0199967125 ≈5.405e-10, which matches.

So why does the quadratic solution give a different x compared to the approximation?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my earlier approximation. Let me recompute.

Wait, initial assumption: Kb = x²/(C) → x= sqrt( Kb * C )

So x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

But when solving the quadratic, x is 3.2875e-6. So that's a significant difference. That suggests that the initial approximation is not valid, which can't be true because x is much smaller than C.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the quadratic solution.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b² +4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)(1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11=4.324e-11 (approx).

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] /2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2.

Which is approximately (6.575e-6)/2 =3.2875e-6.

So the correct x is 3.2875e-6.

So why is the approximation x= sqrt(Kb*C) giving a higher x?

Because perhaps the approximation is only valid when Kb is very small and C is not too small. Hmm.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, I'm getting two different values for x. One from the approximation, and another from the quadratic solution. But they shouldn't be different if the approximation is valid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, another approach is to make a table.

Let me try to compute the exact x.

Let’s say [OH^-] = x.

The expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

We can rearrange this as x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Which is x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / (2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) =2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 =4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] /2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6) /2 →3.2875e-6.

Which is approximately 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A.

But earlier, when I approximated using x= sqrt(Kb*C), I got x=1.04e-5, which leads to pH=9.02. But this is incorrect because the quadratic solution shows that the correct x is 3.28e-6.

Wait, so why did the initial approximation give a wrong result?

Because when Kb is not extremely small compared to C, the approximation might not hold. But in this case, 5.405e-10 is very small compared to 0.02, so the approximation should hold.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of Kb*C.

Wait, Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02.

5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.28e-6, which is less than 1.04e-5. So why the discrepancy?

Wait a minute, perhaps I mixed up the Kb and Kw somewhere.

No, Kw is 1e-14, Kb=Kw/Ka=5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact solution, which gives pH=8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

So the correct option would be A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but earlier, for the 25% point, I calculated pH≈4.25, which matches option A's 4.26.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4.26 at 25%, and 8.52 at equivalence.

But why earlier when I thought the equivalence pH was 9.02 didn't match. Ah, because I forgot to account for the exact solution and assumed the approximation holds, which it didn't, leading to a calculation error.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially present are 0.001, so 25% of these moles is:

\[
\text{Moles reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles unreacted} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are equal to the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.00025 moles. The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{C} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \) and \( C = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot C = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.2875 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.2875 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

Thus, the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. 

Answer: A
