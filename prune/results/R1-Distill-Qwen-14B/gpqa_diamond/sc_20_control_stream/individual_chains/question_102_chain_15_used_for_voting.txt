Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair, and I need to figure out why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's read through the setup carefully. The question is about a bicistronic vector, which means it has two genes (ligand and receptor) in one construct. I remember that bicistronic vectors often use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or other mechanisms to allow translation of both ORFs from a single mRNA.

The vector setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, but there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus, and between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is under the control of an IRES element.

Wait, so the ligand is first, then mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. Same with the receptor and eGFP. So, in the vector, it's like:

5' - [CBA promoter] - ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP - 3'

But wait, I'm a bit confused about how the promoters and stop elements work here. Oh right, the CBA promoter would drive the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor. Because it's a bicistronic construct, the mRNA is made from the CBA promoter and includes both ORFs.

In terms of expression, the ligand is at the 5', so the ribosome would translate it first, then the IRES would allow for the translation of the receptor. But the stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) are between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. The presence of the stop cassettes would prevent the fluorescent proteins from being translated unless the lox sites are recombined away.

So normally, without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place. That means the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being translated unless the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed with eGFP, but again, the stop cassette between them and eGFP would prevent eGFP expression unless the stop is removed.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about how the vector is set up. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette in between. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry. So the ligand is expressed, then the stop is in frame, preventing mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by eGFP, but the stop cassette is between them. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't unless the stop is removed.

But wait, the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the mRNA is a single transcript that includes both ligand and receptor ORFs, separated by an IRES.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter. The first ORF is ligand, which is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). So when the mRNA is made, the ribosome would translate the ligand, then encounter the stop cassette. So mCherry wouldn't be expressed because the stop is there. Similarly, the IRES would allow ribosomes to translate the receptor ORF, which is followed by a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the researchers made a bicistronic vector with the ligand and receptor, and they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and ran a Western blot. The blot uses total proteins, and the signal correlates with actin. So, they probably are checking whether the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, but in the vector setup, without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or is the mCherry just a tag? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

The question states: the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. But the stop cassette is between them. So without Cre, the fusion can't happen because the stop is in the way. But when Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites, removing the stop and allowing the mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand.

Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP, but the stop cassette is between them. So, without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. Because the stop is in the way.

But in the mouse model, they've bred a homozygous construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's only active in neural crest-derived cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre will be active in neural crest cells, which are supposed to express this ligand-receptor pair.

When they do that, the Cre should recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites. Wait, wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. LoxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant version. Cre can only recombine loxP sites if they are the same, but a variant called Dre can recombine lox2272. However, in this scenario, the construct uses loxP for the ligand part and lox2272 for the receptor part.

Wait, but Cre recombinase can only recombine loxP sites. So if the ligand has loxP-stop-loxP, Cre would remove the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. The receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272, which Cre can't act on because it's a different site. So the receptor would still have the stop cassette, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, that would mean that in the offspring, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor wouldn't express eGFP. But in the question, the result is that there's no green signal. So the eGFP (receptor) isn't expressed. So why?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is set up such that the Cre is required to remove both stops. Let me think again.

The vector has ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP). Both have stop cassettes. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272.

So when Cre is introduced, it would only remove the loxP stops, not the lox2272 ones. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, but the receptor would have its stop cassette still intact, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So in the mouse model, why would they look for eGFP?

Wait, but the question says the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, and they crossed it to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, which are where the ligand-receptor pair is initially expressed.

So in the offspring, the Cre would excise the loxP-stop in the ligand part, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor would not be expressed with eGFP.

But in the experiment, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps they expected both ligand and receptor to be expressed, but in reality, only the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), and the receptor isn't expressed (as it's stuck behind the stop, no eGFP).

But the question is about the lack of green signal. eGFP is under the receptor. So if the green signal isn't present, it's because the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop cassette isn't being removed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't recombine.

So in the mouse model, only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no green signal.

So the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Not sure how this affects expression.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Possible, but the question is about expression.

C) enhancer for expression missing. Maybe if the promoter isn't working, but the setup uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. But the question is about the reporter not showing up.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't removed, the reading frame is interrupted. But if the stop is in place, the receptor won't be expressed, so eGFP wouldn't either.

Wait, in the construct, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is in place, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame, but without the stop, it's part of the same ORF as the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP is a single fusion protein.

But in the case of the mouse, the Cre is only removing the loxP sites. The lox2272 sites are for another recombinase, like Dre. So the stop in the receptor remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

So the reason for no green signal is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being excised. Because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't act on. So eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, I need to find which one explains this.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP is in a different frame, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed properly. But wait, in the construct, the stop is between them. So if the stop is in place, the eGFP isn't translated. If the stop is removed, the eGFP would be in frame if the ORF is contiguous. So if they're not in frame, perhaps the reading frame is messed up, but in the construct, the stop is between them, so the frame is cut. So I'm not sure if that's the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the stop is present because Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly state that. So looking at the options again:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Not sure, but paracrine means they act on nearby cells. Not sure how this relates to expression.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would cause a problem in trafficking, but the question is about the absence of eGFP expression. If the eGFP isn't made, the signal won't be there regardless of trafficking.

C) enhancer for ligand and receptor missing. If the promoter isn't working, both wouldn't be expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw expression, perhaps.

Wait, they used a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. So when the plasmid is transfected, Cre isn't present. So in that case, the ligand would be expressed with the mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Wait, no. Without Cre, the stop is present, so mCherry isn't expressed. But the ligand itself is expressed.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The vector is bicistronic, so the CBA promoter drives both ligand and receptor mRNA. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but without Cre, the stop is in the way, so mCherry isn't expressed. The receptor is followed by a stop, so eGFP isn't expressed either.

But the researchers raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are being expressed as proteins, but without the fluorescent tags. So in the Western blot, they're detecting the presence of ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins. Hence, the absence of eGFP in the mouse is because the stop wasn't removed.

So in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would remove the loxP stops but not the lox2272 stops. So ligand-mCherry is expressed, but receptor isn't expressed with eGFP.

But the question is why there's no green signal. Because the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette is still present in the receptor construct. Which is because the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre.

Looking at the options, the possible reasons are:

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. That would affect their expression, but in the Western blot, they saw expression of the proteins, so maybe the promoter is working.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause eGFP to not be expressed, but the stop is in place, so the frame isn't even reached. So probably not.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would lead to eGFP being made but retained in the Golgi, not secreted. But if eGFP isn't made, it wouldn't show up regardless.

Wait, but if the stop is present, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't made. So the absence of green is because eGFP isn't expressed, which is because the stop isn't removed.

But the options don't directly mention that. So looking at the options again, which choice aligns with this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But in the construct, the stop is between them. So in the absence of Cre, the stop is present, and the frame isn't even reached. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in the way.

Wait, but the question says that the offspring are crossed to SOX10-Cre. So Cre is present, but it only removes loxP. The lox2272 stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop cassette, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still present. But none of the options directly state this.

Looking at the options, the possible ones are:

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't even in the same reading frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP would be in frame. But if the ORF was not in frame, then even after removal, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. But the question is whether the stop is preventing expression.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working, but the question says the IRES is upstream of the receptor.

Wait, another approach: the vector is designed so that the ligand and receptor are both expressed, but with the fluorescent proteins. But the Western blot shows expression of the ligand and receptor proteins, but not the fluorescent tags. So in the mouse, when Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't.

But the question is about the eGFP not showing up. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed, because the stop isn't removed.

So the reason is that the stop in the receptor isn't excised. But the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

So the correct answer would be that the stop isn't being removed because the lox sites are incorrect for Cre. But none of the options directly state that.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop is still present, that's why eGFP isn't expressed. But the stop is in the way regardless of the frame. So perhaps the real issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites for the receptor are a different type.

But the options don't include that. So which option is the next best fit.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the setup uses the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so the enhancer isn't the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would affect trafficking, but not expression. So the eGFP would still be made, just not in the right place.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So they act on each other from different cells. But how does that affect expression? The expression levels in the cells would still be present, but perhaps the function is paracrine. But the question is about the expression of the fluorescent proteins, not the function.

Wait, perhaps the reason is that the vector is set up so that both the ligand and receptor are on the same construct but require different Cre sites to be activated. So when only SOX10-Cre is used, which only cuts loxP, the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), but the receptor isn't (no eGFP).

So the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. Because the Cre can't remove the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites are wrong.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option D is the reason. If the ORF isn't in frame, the stop remains, but in the construct design, it's in frame. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the vector's design. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, but the receptor is under the control of an IRES. So after the ligand ORF, there's an IRES that allows the ribosome to translate the receptor. But if the ligand is fused to mCherry, that might interfere with the IRES or the downstream receptor ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop cassettes in both the ligand and receptor parts is causing the problem. But without Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but without the fluorescent tags.

But the question is about the mouse model, which has the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which removes the loxP stops. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor would still have the stop in place because the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't eGFP expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. The reason the stop isn't removed is because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't cut. But none of the options say that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if they are not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in this case, the stop is still present, so the frame isn't even reached.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is such that the receptor ORF is not correctly positioned for the eGFP to be in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly inserted, causing a frameshift.

Wait, but the stop is in the way. So without the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. So the presence of the stop is the main issue.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of another angle.

The mouse model is homozygous for the construct. When they cross it with SOX10-Cre, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which would activate the Cre and cause recombination at the loxP sites.

But the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, so it gets removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre doesn't act on, so the stop remains. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, hence no fluorescent signal.

But none of the options directly mention this. So the closest option would be D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame, but that's not exactly the case. If the stop is removed, they would be in frame.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the lox2272 sites aren't compatible with Cre, so the stop remains. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, the question says the answer is one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

But wait, why would they not be in frame? The construct has the receptor ORF followed by the eGFP, with a stop in between. So if the stop is removed, they're in frame, as they're part of the same ORF.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option again.

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell. If they're paracrine, maybe the eGFP is expressed in a different cell type, but the question is about the same cells where Cre is active (neural crest).

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. This would mean the eGFP is made but not in the right place, but the question is about no signal at all.

C) enhancer for expression missing. But the CBA promoter is strong, so enhancer might not be necessary, and the Western blot shows expression.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF isn't correctly in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed when the stop is removed. But in this case, the stop remains, so the frame isn't even an issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES doesn't work as intended. The IRES is between the ligand and receptor ORFs. So maybe the translation of the receptor isn't happening properly, but the question is about the eGFP.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is D because the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor ORF, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, considering the presence of the stop, the main issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Since none of the options directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is D, assuming that the construct wasn't properly designed for the receptor.

Wait, another thought: the stop cassettes might have a different reading frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. But the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, so removing it would allow eGFP to be in frame.

Unless the stop cassette is in a different frame, which would cause the reading frame to shift when the stop is removed. But I think the stop is in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in the correct frame relative to the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in the same reading frame as the receptor, leading to a frameshift and no expression.

But in the construct, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP in the same frame. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame.

I'm going in circles here. Let me make a decision based on the options given.

The correct answer is likely option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent their expression even if the stop is removed. But in this case, the stop isn't removed because of the lox sites, so that's the real reason. But since that's not an option, perhaps option D is the intended answer.

Wait, another angle: when the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. The presence of the stop is due to the lox sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, and that's because the lox sites are not compatible with Cre.

But the options don't mention that. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option B could be the case if the eGFP is made but not secreted.

But the question states that the Western blot shows signal proportional to actin, meaning they have the ligand and receptor proteins expressed. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. If the stop is in the way, it's because the lox sites can't be cut by Cre.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is D. Alternatively, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says the mouse model is homozygous, implying the construct is properly integrated.

Wait, another thought: the loxP sites are only for the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop is lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry expression. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites are wrong.

But again, none of the options mention this. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the vector design. The ligand and receptor are both supposed to be expressed, but the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is not removed. So the correct reason is that the stop isn't removed because the lox sites are not the same. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is D.

I'm not entirely confident, but I think the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not 100% certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) separated by stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The vector is introduced into a mouse model, and SOX10-Cre is used to excise the loxP sites. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Construct and Experimental Setup:
1. **Vector Design**:
   - The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette in between.
   - The receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette in between.
   - The CBA promoter drives transcription of both ORFs, and the IRES element allows translation of the receptor after the ligand.

2. **Cre Recombinase Activity**:
   - SOX10-Cre is introduced, which excises loxP sites but cannot act on lox2272 sites.
   - In the mouse model, the ligand's stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) is removed, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed.
   - The receptor's stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) remains intact because Cre cannot recombine lox2272 sites, preventing eGFP expression.

3. **Observed Outcome**:
   - mCherry (ligand fusion) is expressed, but eGFP (receptor fusion) is not observed.
   - The absence of eGFP is due to the stop cassette remaining between the receptor and eGFP, preventing their expression.

### Evaluation of the Options:
- **Option A (ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship)**:  
  This describes the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. The issue is not paracrine signaling but rather the failure to express eGFP.

- **Option B (receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi)**:  
  If eGFP were expressed but retained in the Golgi, it would still fluoresce, albeit improperly localized. The absence of fluorescence suggests eGFP is not being expressed at all, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C (enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing)**:  
  The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the Western blot confirms ligand and receptor expression. This rules out a missing enhancer as the cause.

- **Option D (receptor and eGFP are not in frame)**:  
  If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop cassette were removed. However, the stop cassette itself is the primary issue, as it prevents translation of eGFP. The lox2272 sites cannot be excised by Cre, leaving the stop cassette intact. While this is not explicitly stated, this option aligns most closely with the observed outcome.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP remains intact because Cre cannot recombine lox2272 sites. This prevents eGFP expression. While the reasoning points to a limitation in the vector design, the closest explanation among the options is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair, and I need to figure out why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's read through the setup carefully. The question is about a bicistronic vector, which means it has two genes (ligand and receptor) in one construct. I remember that bicistronic vectors often use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or other mechanisms to allow translation of both ORFs from a single mRNA.

The vector setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, but there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus, and between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is under the control of an IRES element.

Wait, so the ligand is first, then mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. Same with the receptor and eGFP. So, in the vector, it's like:

5' - [CBA promoter] - ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP - 3'

But wait, I'm a bit confused about how the promoters and stop elements work here. Oh right, the CBA promoter would drive the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor. Because it's a bicistronic construct, the mRNA is made from the CBA promoter and includes both ORFs.

In terms of expression, the ligand is at the 5', so the ribosome would translate it first, then the IRES would allow for the translation of the receptor. But the stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) are between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. The presence of the stop cassettes would prevent the fluorescent proteins from being translated unless the lox sites are recombined away.

So normally, without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place. That means the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being translated unless the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed with eGFP, but again, the stop cassette between them and eGFP would prevent eGFP expression unless the stop is removed.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about how the vector is set up. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette in between. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry. So the ligand is expressed, then the stop is in frame, preventing mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by eGFP, but the stop cassette is between them. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't unless the stop is removed.

But wait, the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the mRNA is a single transcript that includes both ligand and receptor ORFs, separated by an IRES.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter. The first ORF is ligand, which is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). So when the mRNA is made, the ribosome would translate the ligand, then encounter the stop cassette. So mCherry wouldn't be expressed because the stop is there. Similarly, the IRES would allow ribosomes to translate the receptor ORF, which is followed by a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the researchers made a bicistronic vector with the ligand and receptor, and they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and ran a Western blot. The blot uses total proteins, and the signal correlates with actin. So, they probably are checking whether the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, but in the vector setup, without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or is the mCherry just a tag? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

The question states: the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. But the stop cassette is between them. So without Cre, the fusion can't happen because the stop is in the way. But when Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites, removing the stop and allowing the mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand.

Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP, but the stop cassette is between them. So, without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. Because the stop is in the way.

But in the mouse model, they've bred a homozygous construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's only active in neural crest-derived cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre will be active in neural crest cells, which are supposed to express this ligand-receptor pair.

When they do that, the Cre should recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites. Wait, wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. LoxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant version. Cre can only recombine loxP sites if they are the same, but a variant called Dre can recombine lox2272. However, in this scenario, the construct uses loxP for the ligand part and lox2272 for the receptor part.

Wait, but Cre recombinase can only recombine loxP sites. So if the ligand has loxP-stop-loxP, Cre would remove the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. The receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272, which Cre can't act on because it's a different site. So the receptor would still have the stop cassette, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, that would mean that in the offspring, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor wouldn't express eGFP. But in the question, the result is that there's no green signal. So the eGFP (receptor) isn't expressed. So why?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is set up such that the Cre is required to remove both stops. Let me think again.

The vector has ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP). Both have stop cassettes. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272.

So when Cre is introduced, it would only remove the loxP stops, not the lox2272 ones. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, but the receptor would have its stop cassette still intact, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So in the mouse model, why would they look for eGFP?

Wait, but the question says the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, and they crossed it to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, which are where the ligand-receptor pair is initially expressed.

So in the offspring, the Cre would excise the loxP-stop in the ligand part, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor would not be expressed with eGFP.

But in the experiment, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps they expected both ligand and receptor to be expressed, but in reality, only the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), and the receptor isn't expressed (as it's stuck behind the stop, no eGFP).

But the question is about the lack of green signal. eGFP is under the receptor. So if the green signal isn't present, it's because the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop cassette isn't being removed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't recombine.

So in the mouse model, only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no green signal.

So the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Not sure how this affects expression.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Possible, but the question is about expression.

C) enhancer for expression missing. Maybe if the promoter isn't working, but the setup uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. But the question is about the reporter not showing up.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't removed, the reading frame is interrupted. But if the stop is in place, the receptor won't be expressed, so eGFP wouldn't either.

Wait, in the construct, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is in place, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame, but without the stop, it's part of the same ORF as the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP is a single fusion protein.

But in the case of the mouse, the Cre is only removing the loxP sites. The lox2272 sites are for another recombinase, like Dre. So the stop in the receptor remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

So the reason for no green signal is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being excised. Because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't act on. So eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, I need to find which one explains this.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP is in a different frame, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed properly. But wait, in the construct, the stop is between them. So if the stop is in place, the eGFP isn't translated. If the stop is removed, the eGFP would be in frame if the ORF is contiguous. So if they're not in frame, perhaps the reading frame is messed up, but in the construct, the stop is between them, so the frame is cut. So I'm not sure if that's the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the stop is present because Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly state that. So looking at the options again:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Not sure, but paracrine means they act on nearby cells. Not sure how this relates to expression.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would cause a problem in trafficking, but the question is about the absence of eGFP expression. If the eGFP isn't made, the signal won't be there regardless of trafficking.

C) enhancer for ligand and receptor missing. If the promoter isn't working, both wouldn't be expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw expression, perhaps.

Wait, they used a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. So when the plasmid is transfected, Cre isn't present. So in that case, the ligand would be expressed with the mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Wait, no. Without Cre, the stop is present, so mCherry isn't expressed. But the ligand itself is expressed.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The vector is bicistronic, so the CBA promoter drives both ligand and receptor mRNA. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but without Cre, the stop is in the way, so mCherry isn't expressed. The receptor is followed by a stop, so eGFP isn't expressed either.

But the researchers raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are being expressed as proteins, but without the fluorescent tags. So in the Western blot, they're detecting the presence of ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins. Hence, the absence of eGFP in the mouse is because the stop wasn't removed.

So in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would remove the loxP stops but not the lox2272 stops. So ligand-mCherry is expressed, but receptor isn't expressed with eGFP.

But the question is why there's no green signal. Because the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette is still present in the receptor construct. Which is because the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre.

Looking at the options, the possible reasons are:

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. That would affect their expression, but in the Western blot, they saw expression of the proteins, so maybe the promoter is working.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause eGFP to not be expressed, but the stop is in place, so the frame isn't even reached. So probably not.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would lead to eGFP being made but retained in the Golgi, not secreted. But if eGFP isn't made, it wouldn't show up regardless.

Wait, but if the stop is present, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't made. So the absence of green is because eGFP isn't expressed, which is because the stop isn't removed.

But the options don't directly mention that. So looking at the options again, which choice aligns with this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But in the construct, the stop is between them. So in the absence of Cre, the stop is present, and the frame isn't even reached. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in the way.

Wait, but the question says that the offspring are crossed to SOX10-Cre. So Cre is present, but it only removes loxP. The lox2272 stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop cassette, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still present. But none of the options directly state this.

Looking at the options, the possible ones are:

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't even in the same reading frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP would be in frame. But if the ORF was not in frame, then even after removal, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. But the question is whether the stop is preventing expression.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working, but the question says the IRES is upstream of the receptor.

Wait, another approach: the vector is designed so that the ligand and receptor are both expressed, but with the fluorescent proteins. But the Western blot shows expression of the ligand and receptor proteins, but not the fluorescent tags. So in the mouse, when Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't.

But the question is about the eGFP not showing up. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed, because the stop isn't removed.

So the reason is that the stop in the receptor isn't excised. But the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

So the correct answer would be that the stop isn't being removed because the lox sites are incorrect for Cre. But none of the options directly state that.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop is still present, that's why eGFP isn't expressed. But the stop is in the way regardless of the frame. So perhaps the real issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites for the receptor are a different type.

But the options don't include that. So which option is the next best fit.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the setup uses the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so the enhancer isn't the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would affect trafficking, but not expression. So the eGFP would still be made, just not in the right place.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So they act on each other from different cells. But how does that affect expression? The expression levels in the cells would still be present, but perhaps the function is paracrine. But the question is about the expression of the fluorescent proteins, not the function.

Wait, perhaps the reason is that the vector is set up so that both the ligand and receptor are on the same construct but require different Cre sites to be activated. So when only SOX10-Cre is used, which only cuts loxP, the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), but the receptor isn't (no eGFP).

So the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. Because the Cre can't remove the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites are wrong.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option D is the reason. If the ORF isn't in frame, the stop remains, but in the construct design, it's in frame. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the vector's design. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, but the receptor is under the control of an IRES. So after the ligand ORF, there's an IRES that allows the ribosome to translate the receptor. But if the ligand is fused to mCherry, that might interfere with the IRES or the downstream receptor ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop cassettes in both the ligand and receptor parts is causing the problem. But without Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but without the fluorescent tags.

But the question is about the mouse model, which has the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which removes the loxP stops. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor would still have the stop in place because the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't eGFP expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. The reason the stop isn't removed is because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't cut. But none of the options say that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if they are not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in this case, the stop is still present, so the frame isn't even reached.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is such that the receptor ORF is not correctly positioned for the eGFP to be in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly inserted, causing a frameshift.

Wait, but the stop is in the way. So without the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. So the presence of the stop is the main issue.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of another angle.

The mouse model is homozygous for the construct. When they cross it with SOX10-Cre, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which would activate the Cre and cause recombination at the loxP sites.

But the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, so it gets removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre doesn't act on, so the stop remains. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, hence no fluorescent signal.

But none of the options directly mention this. So the closest option would be D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame, but that's not exactly the case. If the stop is removed, they would be in frame.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the lox2272 sites aren't compatible with Cre, so the stop remains. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, the question says the answer is one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

But wait, why would they not be in frame? The construct has the receptor ORF followed by the eGFP, with a stop in between. So if the stop is removed, they're in frame, as they're part of the same ORF.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option again.

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell. If they're paracrine, maybe the eGFP is expressed in a different cell type, but the question is about the same cells where Cre is active (neural crest).

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. This would mean the eGFP is made but not in the right place, but the question is about no signal at all.

C) enhancer for expression missing. But the CBA promoter is strong, so enhancer might not be necessary, and the Western blot shows expression.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF isn't correctly in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed when the stop is removed. But in this case, the stop remains, so the frame isn't even an issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES doesn't work as intended. The IRES is between the ligand and receptor ORFs. So maybe the translation of the receptor isn't happening properly, but the question is about the eGFP.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is D because the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor ORF, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, considering the presence of the stop, the main issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Since none of the options directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is D, assuming that the construct wasn't properly designed for the receptor.

Wait, another thought: the stop cassettes might have a different reading frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. But the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, so removing it would allow eGFP to be in frame.

Unless the stop cassette is in a different frame, which would cause the reading frame to shift when the stop is removed. But I think the stop is in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in the correct frame relative to the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in the same reading frame as the receptor, leading to a frameshift and no expression.

But in the construct, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP in the same frame. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame.

I'm going in circles here. Let me make a decision based on the options given.

The correct answer is likely option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent their expression even if the stop is removed. But in this case, the stop isn't removed because of the lox sites, so that's the real reason. But since that's not an option, perhaps option D is the intended answer.

Wait, another angle: when the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. The presence of the stop is due to the lox sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, and that's because the lox sites are not compatible with Cre.

But the options don't mention that. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option B could be the case if the eGFP is made but not secreted.

But the question states that the Western blot shows signal proportional to actin, meaning they have the ligand and receptor proteins expressed. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. If the stop is in the way, it's because the lox sites can't be cut by Cre.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is D. Alternatively, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says the mouse model is homozygous, implying the construct is properly integrated.

Wait, another thought: the loxP sites are only for the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop is lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry expression. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites are wrong.

But again, none of the options mention this. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the vector design. The ligand and receptor are both supposed to be expressed, but the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is not removed. So the correct reason is that the stop isn't removed because the lox sites are not the same. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is D.

I'm not entirely confident, but I think the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not 100% certain.


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) separated by stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The vector is introduced into a mouse model, and SOX10-Cre is used to excise the loxP sites. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Construct and Experimental Setup:
1. **Vector Design**:
   - The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette in between.
   - The receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette in between.
   - The CBA promoter drives transcription of both ORFs, and the IRES element allows translation of the receptor after the ligand.

2. **Cre Recombinase Activity**:
   - SOX10-Cre is introduced, which excises loxP sites but cannot act on lox2272 sites.
   - In the mouse model, the ligand's stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) is removed, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed.
   - The receptor's stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) remains intact because Cre cannot recombine lox2272 sites, preventing eGFP expression.

3. **Observed Outcome**:
   - mCherry (ligand fusion) is expressed, but eGFP (receptor fusion) is not observed.
   - The absence of eGFP is due to the stop cassette remaining between the receptor and eGFP, preventing their expression.

### Evaluation of the Options:
- **Option A (ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship)**:  
  This describes the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. The issue is not paracrine signaling but rather the failure to express eGFP.

- **Option B (receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi)**:  
  If eGFP were expressed but retained in the Golgi, it would still fluoresce, albeit improperly localized. The absence of fluorescence suggests eGFP is not being expressed at all, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C (enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing)**:  
  The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the Western blot confirms ligand and receptor expression. This rules out a missing enhancer as the cause.

- **Option D (receptor and eGFP are not in frame)**:  
  If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop cassette were removed. However, the stop cassette itself is the primary issue, as it prevents translation of eGFP. The lox2272 sites cannot be excised by Cre, leaving the stop cassette intact. While this is not explicitly stated, this option aligns most closely with the observed outcome.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP remains intact because Cre cannot recombine lox2272 sites. This prevents eGFP expression. While the reasoning points to a limitation in the vector design, the closest explanation among the options is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

ANSWER: D
