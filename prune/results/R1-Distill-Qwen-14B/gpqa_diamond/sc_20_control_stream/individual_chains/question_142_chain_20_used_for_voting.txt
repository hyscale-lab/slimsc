Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this must be a mixed state because it's a convex combination of different projectors, right? 

Let me break it down. The state |0><0| is the density matrix for the pure state |0>, and similarly for |1><1|. Each of these has a coefficient of 1/2, so ρ is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>. So ρ is a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a point on the unit sphere, given by the Bloch vector r, such that the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. 

But wait, ρ in this case is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute this. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So ρ = (I)/2. Now, the general form for a density matrix on the Bloch sphere is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing this to our ρ:

( I + 0*σ_x + 0*σ_y + 0*σ_z ) /2 = I/2. 

So the vector r here must be (0, 0, 0). Because all the components r_x, r_y, r_z are zero. 

Wait, so the geometrical position is the origin? That makes sense because the completely mixed state has no direction, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere. 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. Option B is (0,0,1), but that's the point at the north pole, which would correspond to the pure state |0> or something else. Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, the pure state |0> would be represented by (0,0,1) because σ_z is diagonal, so the Bloch vector is along z-axis. But our ρ is a mixed state, so it's at the center.

So the correct answer must be option C, r=(0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To analyze its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \( \rho \), we see that \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies that all components of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) are zero (\( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), \( r_z = 0 \)).

This means the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the completely mixed state. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state (e.g., \( \left|0\right\rangle \)).  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
