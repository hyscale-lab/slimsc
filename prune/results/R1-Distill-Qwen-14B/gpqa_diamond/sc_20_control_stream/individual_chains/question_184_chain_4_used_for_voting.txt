Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might matter here. So, position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions, but wait, that's a meta arrangement? Or maybe it's adjacent.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the substituents as 1, 2, 3 would mean that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they are all adjacent to each other? No, wait, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, then position 3 is the next, making them all meta to each other? Wait, no. If the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, then 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are meta. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions in a way that they are adjacent in a certain order.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering starts with ethoxy at position 1, then the tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So on the benzene ring, substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So they are adjacent in a 1-2-3 order. So ethoxy is at position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the ring would have substituents at adjacent positions in a row.

Wait, but how do you plan the synthesis? The starting material is benzene, and each step is a substitution reaction. But since benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, the order of adding groups might affect the positions of the substituents due to directing effects.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. tert-Butyl is a bulky group and a deactivating (since it's an alkyl group, but wait, tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group which donates electrons through sigma bonds), so it's an ortho/para director. Wait, wait, no. Wait, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is an activating group (since they donate electrons through C-H sigma bonds), so they are ortho/para directors.

But wait, nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but when adding multiple substituents, the order in which they are added will determine the positions. For example, if you first add a tert-butyl group, which is ortho/para directing, then when adding another substituent, it will go to ortho or para of the tert-butyl.

But for the target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions. So maybe I should think about how each substituent is added in the correct order to get the desired positions.

Wait, let's list the substituents in the target:

- Position 1: ethoxy group (OEt)
- Position 2: tert-butyl (t-Bu)
- Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So, looking at this, ethoxy is at position 1, and nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy. Then, tert-butyl is at position 2, which is between ethoxy and nitro.

Wait, that's not possible because in a benzene ring, substituents in 1, 2, and 3 positions are adjacent in a way that each is next to the others. So, the substituents are all adjacent to each other, forming a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

So, how to get all three substituents on adjacent positions. Let me think about the synthesis steps.

Starting with benzene, we need to add the substituents in a way that the directing effects allow each new substituent to be in the correct position relative to the others.

Let me think about possible sequences. Since the nitro group is a meta director and deactivating, it's probably best to add it later because it slows down further substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's added after activating groups.

Wait, but nitro group is deactivating, so after adding a nitro group, it's harder to add another substituent. So perhaps the nitro group should be added last.

Wait, but that depends on the order of adding substituents. Let me think about each substituent's effect.

First, let's think about the substituents and their order:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then, ethoxy. Then nitro.

But wait, the tert-butyl is an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing. So when adding the next substituent (ethoxy), it would go to ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Let's say we add ethoxy next; it would go into a position relative to the tert-butyl.

But then, adding nitro group (deactivating, meta) would be difficult because the ring is already less reactive.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to add the nitro group first. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so adding substituents after it would be harder. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first, which is activating, so any subsequent groups would be directed by it.

Wait, let me think. The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Ethoxy is an activating group, so any substituent added after would be directed by ethoxy. That might help in placing the other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the tert-butyl first. Let's say we add tert-butyl to benzene using Friedel-Crafts alkylation (AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride). Then, the next step is to add a nitro group. But wait, after Friedel-Crafts, the ring is activated. So adding nitro group next would require using a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4). But wait, the ring is already activated, maybe making the nitration easier.

Wait, but if I first add tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy, would that work? Let me see.

So first step: benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride to give tert-butylbenzene. Then, nitrating it to add a nitro group. But where would the nitro group go? The tert-butyl is a strong activating group and ortho/para director. So the nitro group would add to the ortho or para positions relative to tert-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3 relative to ethoxy at 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Another approach is to determine the order of adding substituents based on the desired positions. Since the target has three substituents, perhaps the first substituent should be the one which directs the next substituent to the correct position.

Alternatively, think about the substituents in the order they are added to the benzene ring.

Option: Let's consider adding ethoxy first. Benzene + ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution? No, wait, ethoxy group is typically added through an SN2 mechanism, but benzene doesn't have a good leaving group. Oh, wait, no. To add an ethoxy group to benzene, you can use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strongly activated ring. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group and then substituting.

Wait, maybe not. Another way is to use a Friedel-Crafts alkylation for tert-butyl first, then nitration, and then ethoxylation. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about each substituent's effect again.

tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director.

Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director.

Nitro is deactivating, meta director.

So, when adding substituents, the first group will direct where the next group goes.

So, to get the substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3, perhaps the first substituent is ethoxy, then the next is tert-butyl, and then nitro.

Let's see:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene. Benzene + ethoxy group using, say, a nucleophilic substitution? Wait, benzene isn't nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps using a two-step process, like forming a benzene oxide and then substituting, but that's complicated.

Wait, another way: maybe use a directing group, like a nitro group, then substitute. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents in the order they are added. Let me think about the options provided.

The options are all sequences of reactions, so I can look through them.

Looking at option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration
ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction? Fe/HCl is sometimes for dissolving metal reductions, like in the Birch reduction, but more commonly, Fe and HCl is for something else. Wait, perhaps it's for removing a nitro group? No, wait, Fe and HCl with a nitro group would reduce it to amine.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/ AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis?

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe steam distillation or acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → probably an SN2 reaction, like Williamson ether synthesis, but I'm not sure how that fits here.

viii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of a group.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Not sure. Does this make sense? It seems to involve multiple steps, including sulfonation and diazotization, which is probably for something else.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce a nitro group to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (like for diazonium salts).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ether formation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

Hmm, so this approach adds t-Bu, then nitro. Then reducing nitro to amine, then nitrating again? Not sure.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ether formation.

Wait, adding t-Bu first, then sulfonate (SO3), then nitrate, then reduce, then diazotize, then nitrate again, etc. Not sure how that would arrange the substituents.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis again.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ether formation.

Hmm. So this approach nitrates benzene first, then reduces to amine, then alkylates, etc. Maybe this could work, but let's think about the directing effects.

If we first nitrate benzene (step i), the nitro group is a meta director. Then, when we reduce it to an amine (step ii: Fe/HCl), the amine is a strong activating, ortho/para director. Then, when we add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts (step iii), it would go to ortho or para of the amine.

Wait, but after reducing the nitro group to an amine, the ring is strongly activated. So adding tert-butyl via FC alkylation would occur at ortho or para to the amine.

So, after steps i and ii, the ring has an amine group. Then in step iii, we add t-Bu. So, the t-Bu would be at ortho or para to the amine.

Then, step iv is nitration again. Since the ring has an amine (activating, ortho/para) and a t-Bu (activating, ortho/para), the nitration would occur at a position directed by both groups.

Wait, but nitro groups are deactivating, so adding another nitro group would be in a position directed by the existing groups.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the target structure again.

Target: 2-(t-Bu)-1-OEt-3-NO2.

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

If I start by nitrating benzene (step i in option D), then I get nitrobenzene. Then, reduce nitro to amine (step ii: Fe/HCl, which is a typical way to reduce nitro to amine), giving phenylamine. Then, FC alkylation (step iii) would add t-Bu to the benzene ring at ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, if the amine is at position 1, then t-Bu would be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, so that's possible.

So, after step iii, structure would be benzene with amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2.

Then step iv is nitrating again. So the ring now has amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Both are activating and ortho/para directors.

Where would the nitro group add? Let's see.

The existing groups are at 1 (amine) and 2 (t-Bu). The amine at 1 is ortho/para directing. So possible positions for nitro would be ortho to amine (position 2), but that's already occupied by t-Bu. So the next possible would be para to amine, which is position 4. But the target has nitro at position 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration step iv in option D is adding the nitro group at position 3. How?

Wait, perhaps the nitration step is directed by the t-Bu group. The t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho/para directing. So nitration could occur at ortho (position 1, which is amine; not possible), para (position 6), or meta relative to t-Bu. Wait, but t-Bu is activating, so nitration should be directed ortho or para.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the directing effects again. An amine is a strong activating group and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. The t-Bu is a weaker activating group, but still ortho/para.

So, when both are present, the positions available would be determined by the most activating group. The amine is more activating, so it might dominate.

So, in the ring with amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2, the next nitration would likely go to the positions ortho or para to the amine. Ortho to amine is 2 and 6; para is 4. Since position 2 is already taken by t-Bu, the nitro could go to position 6 (meta to t-Bu) or position 4.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). Wait, how?

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't leading me to the target structure. Maybe the order of adding substituents is different.

Alternative approach: Let me consider that the ethoxy group is added after the tert-butyl and nitro groups. How would that work?

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group. Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a different method, like using an etherification step.

Wait, another thought: to introduce ethoxy group, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution isn't feasible. Alternatively, maybe using a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that's for making ethyl groups, not ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps using a directing group. For example, if I have a nitro group first, then reduce it to an amine, then introduce ethoxy via another substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The target has substituents in positions 1,2,3. So, perhaps the nitro group is in position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy at 1. So, the ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2.

So, the order of addition would need to arrange these substituents correctly. Let me think about adding the nitro group last because it's deactivating. Then, the ethoxy and tert-butyl would be added earlier.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl to benzene.

2. Add ethoxy, directed by tert-butyl.

3. Add nitro group, directed by existing groups.

Wait, but adding ethoxy after tert-butyl. Let's see:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride: benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Now, the ring has a t-Bu group (ortho/para director). Next, add ethoxy group. Where would that go? Ortho or para to t-Bu. So, position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added before the tert-butyl. So, first add ethoxy, then add t-Bu.

Let's think:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene. How? Using a nucleophilic substitution? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, using a substitution where a group is replaced. Wait, maybe using a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group, which benzene doesn't naturally have. Alternatively, maybe using a benzyne intermediate or some other method, but perhaps that's too complicated.

Wait, another way: Maybe I can make toluene, then substitute a methyl group with ethoxy, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Let's think about using a sulfonic acid group as a leaving group. So:

1. Sulfonate benzene to make benzene sulfonic acid. Then, perhaps perform a nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide to replace the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy. But that would require a strong base and high temperature, which might be possible.

But I'm not sure if that's the method intended here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ether.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try to walk through this option.

Step i: add t-Bu group → t-Bu-benzene.

Step ii: sulfonate → introduces a sulfonic acid group. So, the ring now has t-Bu and SO3H groups. Where is the SO3H added? Since t-Bu is an activating, ortho/para director, the sulfonic acid would be added at ortho or para to t-Bu.

Wait, but sulfonation is a reaction that adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong meta-directing, deactivating group. So, when the ring has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para), the next substituent (SO3H) would go to the position directed by t-Bu. So, the SO3H would be ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say it's para; then, in the ring, t-Bu is at position 1, SO3H at position 4.

Then, step iii: nitration. The ring has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta). The nitration would be directed by the strongest director, which is t-Bu. So nitration would occur ortho or para to t-Bu. Suppose it's ortho, position 2.

So, now the ring has t-Bu at 1, SO3H at 4, and nitro at 2.

Step iv: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So nitro at 2 becomes amine at 2.

Now, the ring has t-Bu at 1, SO3H at 4, amine at 2.

Step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. This converts the amine to a diazonium chloride, typically under cold, acidic conditions.

Step vi: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Wait, but the ring now has t-Bu (activating), SO3H (deactivating), and diazonium group. Diazonium salts are usually meta directors. But this is getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps after making the diazonium salt, the group can be replaced. For example, upon heating with H2O (step vii: H3O+, H2O/Heat), the diazonium group would undergo hydrolysis to a phenol or other group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this might not be the right path.

Another approach: Let's think about the target structure again. The substituents are 1-OEt, 2-t-Bu, 3-NO2.

So, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2).

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added last. Let me think about adding it last.

So, if we have benzene with ethoxy and t-Bu groups, then nitrate it.

But where would the nitro group go?

If ethoxy is at 1 and t-Bu at 2, then the next substituent would be directed by both.

Ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). So, possible positions for nitro would be determined by the combined directing.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would go into position 3, which is adjacent to both groups. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy and t-Bu are in ortho positions, and the nitro is added in the adjacent position.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the order of substitution.

Another possibility: The nitro group is added first. Since nitro is meta-directing, any subsequent substitution would be in the meta position relative to nitro. But that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the order is: add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, perhaps using a nitration step, then a reduction step to an amine, then ethoxylation.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at each option's reaction sequence and see which one makes sense.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group at para position.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → FC alkylation. The amine is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would go ortho or para to amine.

If the amine is at para position (from initial nitration), after reduction, it's at a certain position. Then, FC alkylation would add t-Bu at ortho or para to amine.

Hmm. Let's try to map this.

After step i: nitro group at position 1 (let's say), making nitrobenzene.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine → benzene with amine at 1.

Step iii: FC alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu group at ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to amine.

Assume it adds at position 2.

So, structure is 1-amino-2-t-Bu benzene.

Step iv: nitration again. Now, the ring has amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Amine is activating, so nitration would be ortho or para to amine. But position 2 is occupied by t-Bu, so the next possible would be position 4 (para to amine). So nitro group would be at position 4.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3. Hmm. So that's not matching.

Wait, but then step v is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. So the nitro group is at 4, which is a nitro group. Wait, no. Step iv is another nitration, so after step iii, the ring has amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Step iv would add nitro at position 4.

Then, step v: diazotization of the amine (position 1) would produce a diazonium salt.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Where would that go? The ring now has t-Bu (position 2), nitro (position 4), and a diazonium group at 1.

The sulfonic acid group would be directed by the existing groups. But I'm getting lost here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that option D's steps lead to the correct substituents.

Wait, after step iii, the ring has amine at 1, t-Bu at 2.

Step iv: nitration → nitro at position 4.

Then, step v: diazo reaction converts amine at 1 to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: sulfonation → where would sulfonic acid group go? The existing groups are t-Bu (ortho/para) and nitro (meta). The diazonium group is a leaving group. Wait, perhaps the sulfonic acid is added in a position directed by the other groups.

But this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try another approach.

Another approach: The target has an ethoxy group, which is a strong activating group. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last, using a substitution reaction. For example, using NaOH and EtBr in an SN2 reaction to substitute a good leaving group, like a tosylate.

So, the steps might involve:

1. Add t-Bu and nitro groups, then introduce ethoxy via substitution.

But to introduce ethoxy via substitution, we need a leaving group. So, perhaps first add a nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then introduce a leaving group, then substitute with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps nitrate, then sulfonate, then substitute.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about each step in the correct sequence.

The target is 2-t-Bu-1-OEt-3-NO2.

So, substituents are at 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2).

So, from benzene, I need to add these three groups in the correct positions.

The order of addition is crucial.

If I add OEt first, then t-Bu, then NO2.

But OEt is activating, so when adding t-Bu, it would go ortho or para to OEt.

After that, adding NO2 would be directed by OEt and t-Bu.

Wait, but OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2. Then, where would NO2 go?

The ring has OEt (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). So, the next group would be directed by both. The possible positions are 3, 4, 5, etc. But in the target, NO2 is at 3, which is adjacent to OEt and t-Bu.

Hmm, maybe that's possible. Let's see.

So, steps:

1. Add OEt to benzene.

2. Add t-Bu via FC alkylation.

3. Add NO2.

But how to add OEt first.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. So, I'm stuck here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe use a directing group, like nitro, to direct where the substituents go.

Perhaps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → amine at 1.

3. FC alkylation → add t-Bu at ortho or para to amine.

Assume it adds at position 2.

4. Now, the ring has amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2.

5. Introduce ethoxy group. How? Maybe via a substitution reaction, but need a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps convert the amine to a better leaving group, like a tosylate, then substitute with ethoxide.

But I'm not sure if that's part of the options.

Looking back at the options, which one includes steps that could lead to the target.

Option D:

After step iii, the ring has amine at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Then, step iv: nitration adds nitro at 4.

Wait, but target has nitro at 3. So perhaps this is not the right path.

Another option is option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ether.

Hmm, let's see.

Step i: t-Bu added to benzene.

Step ii: nitrate → where would the nitro go? Directed by t-Bu (ortho/para). Suppose nitro is at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Let's say position 2.

Wait, but t-Bu is at position 1. So nitro at position 2.

So structure is 1-t-Bu-2-nitrobenzene.

Step iii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. Now, structure is 1-t-Bu-2-amino benzene.

Step iv: nitrate again. Now, the ring has t-Bu (activating) and amine (activating). The next nitration would be directed by the strongest activating group. The amine is more activating, so nitration would be ortho or para to amine.

Amine is at position 2. So possible positions are 1 (occupied by t-Bu), 3 (ortho), and 6 (para). So nitro would go to position 3 or 6.

If nitro is added to position 3, that's our target. So step iv would add nitro at 3.

So, structure now is 1-t-Bu-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene.

Wait, but that can't be right because the target has nitro at 3. Hmm, but after this, step v is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine.

So, the amine at 2 would be converted to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol. So, position 2 would become -OH.

But in the target, position 2 is t-Bu. So this would replace the t-Bu? No, because t-Bu is already at position 1.

Wait, perhaps this is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, maybe after step iv, the ring has t-Bu at 1, nitro at 3, and amine at 2.

Then step v: diazo converts amine at 2 to diazonium.

Step vi: hydrolysis replaces diazonium with hydroxyl group.

Then, structure would be 1-t-Bu-2-OH-3-nitrobenzene.

Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr → SN2 reaction. But the hydroxyl group is a good leaving group. So, in the presence of NaOH and EtBr, the hydroxyl would be replaced by ethoxy group.

So, structure becomes 1-t-Bu-2-OEt-3-nitrobenzene. Which matches the target.

So, looking at option B's steps:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 2 (ortho to t-Bu at 1).

iii) reduce nitro to amine → amine at 2.

iv) nitrate → nitro at 3 (ortho to amine at 2).

v) diazo → amine at 2 becomes diazonium.

vi) hydrolysis → OH at 2.

vii) NaOH + EtBr → OEt at 2.

So, the substituents are t-Bu at 1, OEt at 2, nitro at 3. Which is exactly the target.

So, option B's steps would lead to the target.

Wait, but in step iv, after having t-Bu at 1 and amine at 2, when we nitrate again (step iv), where does the nitro group go? Since both t-Bu and amine are activating, the most activating is the amine. So, nitration would occur ortho or para to the amine.

Amine is at 2. So ortho positions are 1 and 3, and para is 6.

But position 1 is occupied by t-Bu, so nitro can go to 3 or 6.

If it goes to 3, that's our target. So that works.

Then, the steps in option B lead to the correct structure.

So, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the order of addition. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro) on the benzene ring. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Option B:
1. **Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**  
   Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group to benzene. The tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.

2. **Step ii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**  
   Nitration introduces a nitro group. The tert-butyl group directs the nitro group to the ortho position (position 2 relative to tert-butyl, which is position 1). Thus, the nitro group is added at position 2.

3. **Step iii: Fe/HCl**  
   The nitro group at position 2 is reduced to an amine group (-NH₂). The amine group is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.

4. **Step iv: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**  
   A second nitration occurs. The amine group at position 2 directs the new nitro group to the ortho position (position 3 relative to the amine). Thus, the nitro group is added at position 3.

5. **Step v: NaNO₂/HCl**  
   Diazotization converts the amine group at position 2 into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).

6. **Step vi: H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**  
   Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt at position 2 replaces it with a hydroxyl group (-OH).

7. **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr**  
   A substitution reaction replaces the hydroxyl group at position 2 with an ethoxy group (-OEt), completing the target structure.

### Final Structure:
After these steps, the benzene ring has:
- **Position 1**: Ethoxy group (-OEt),
- **Position 2**: Tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃),
- **Position 3**: Nitro group (-NO₂).

This matches the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the correct sequence of reactions to achieve the desired product.
