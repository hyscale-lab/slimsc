Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the nucleus splits into two parts, and there's a release of energy because the binding energy is lower in the products. But wait, the exact details are a bit fuzzy.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Oh, okay, so that's the initial energy. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Wait, so let me denote the masses. Let me call the smaller mass m, so the larger one is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is (m + 2m) = 3m. But the problem says this sum is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh, wait, so 3m = 0.99 M. That means m is (0.99/3) M, so m is 0.33 M approximately. Wait, no, wait, 0.99 M divided by 3 is about 0.33 M. So the smaller fragment is 0.33 M, the larger is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait, the initial mass M must have some relation to the rest mass. Oh, because when it splits, the rest masses of the two fragments plus any kinetic energy and binding energy changes. But wait, the problem says the sum of rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So the mass lost is 1% of M, right? So that 1% goes into kinetic energy and other forms, like the energy of the fragments.

But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1). So I need to find T1, and then compare the relativistic calculation with the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The difference between them is what we're after.

Wait, but how? Let me think. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because the system is isolated. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So if the larger fragment has mass 2m (wait, wait, no. Wait, the sum is 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M, 2m = 0.66 M. So the larger fragment is 0.66 M, the smaller 0.33 M. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial mass is M, and the sum of the rest masses after is 0.99 M. So, when they split, the rest mass is 0.99 M. So the mass difference is 0.01 M, which would be the energy released, right?

So the rest mass of the original nucleus is M. When it splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2 m2. Because "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other." So, m1 = 2 m2. So m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M. So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. Got it.

Now, when the nucleus splits, the two fragments move with some velocities. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p1 = -p2. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Since m1 is larger, v1 would be smaller than v2.

But wait, the problem is about their kinetic energies. So, let's think about their kinetic energies. The total kinetic energy released would be (assuming no other energy losses) the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the sum of the rest mass energies of the fragments. Wait, but in reality, it's more like the binding energy is converted into kinetic energy and any other forms. Hmm, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest mass energies is 0.99 M c². So the energy released is (M - 0.99 M) c² = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV (since M c² is 300 GeV). So the total kinetic energy plus any other forms (like the energy carried by neutrons or other particles, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so probably all goes into kinetic energy of the two fragments).

So total kinetic energy K_total = (M - (m1 + m2)) c² = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

But wait, M is given as 300 GeV. Wait, wait. No, rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV.

So K_total = 3 GeV.

Now, the two fragments are moving with some kinetic energies. Since the system is at rest, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p1 = m1 v1 / sqrt(1 - v1²/c²) ) ?

Wait, no, relativistic momentum is gamma m v. But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So p1 = -p2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But in the center-of-momentum frame, everything is symmetric. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of a different approach.

Wait, since the system is at rest, the total relativistic energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. So, the initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV. The final energy is (m1 c² + gamma1 m1 c²) + (m2 c² + gamma2 m2 c²) ) = (m1 + m2) c² + (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2) c².

Wait, but that's not correct because the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) m c². So, the total energy after fission is (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2. So, the initial energy is M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2. So, K1 + K2 = (M - (m1 + m2)) c² = 3 GeV.

So, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

Now, the problem says T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. Let's denote T1 as K1 and T2 as K2. So, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

We also know that the system's total momentum is zero, so the relativistic momenta must cancel each other: p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, and p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. But since p1 = -p2, we have gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, this part is tricky because we have to relate the velocities and momenta. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the concept that in the center-of-mass frame, the two fragments move with opposite momenta.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the conservation of energy and momentum.

So,

Conservation of momentum:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Conservation of energy:

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c².

We can write this as:

M c² = (0.99 M c²) + (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2) c².

Which simplifies to:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = (M - 0.99 M) c² / c² = 0.01 M.

Wait, no, because:

M c² = (0.99 M c²) + (gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c²).

So,

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c² - 0.99 M c² = 0.01 M c².

Divide both sides by c²:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = 0.01 M.

But M is the initial mass, and m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So substituting,

gamma1 (0.66 M) + gamma2 (0.33 M) = 0.01 M.

Divide both sides by M:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 0.01.

Hmm, that's equation one.

Equation two comes from momentum conservation.

p1 = p2, but opposite in direction. So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But wait, we can also express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So v = beta c.

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of beta and gamma.

Let me think of another approach. Since the system is symmetric in terms of energy and momentum, perhaps we can use the concept of invariant mass.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the total energy is conserved and the total momentum is zero, we can find the velocities of the two fragments.

But this might get too involved. Maybe another approach is to look for non-relativistic approximations. The problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1.

Wait, so perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies are calculated using (1/2) m v². So perhaps we can calculate what T1 would be in both cases and find the difference.

Let me first compute the non-relativistic case.

In non-relativistic fission, assuming momentum is conserved, the initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments must be equal and opposite.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

In non-relativistic, kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1²) + (1/2 m2 v2²) ) = 3 GeV (the total KE).

Wait, but with m1 = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M, and M is the initial mass.

So, let me denote m1 = 2m and m2 = m, where m = 0.33 M.

So, m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, momentum conservation gives (2m) v1 = m v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

Kinetic energy:

(1/2)(2m) v1² + (1/2)(m) v2² = 3 GeV.

Substituting v2 = 2 v1,

(1/2)(2m) v1² + (1/2)(m) (4 v1^2) ) = 3 GeV.

Simplify:

m v1² + 2 m v1² = 3 GeV → 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

But m = 0.33 M → m = (0.33)(M). So,

(0.33 M) v1² = 1 GeV.

But M is 300 GeV/c², because the rest mass energy is M c² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV/c².

So,

0.33 * (300 GeV/c²) * v1² = 1 GeV.

So,

(99 GeV/c²) * v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) = c² / 99.

So v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c / 9.95 ≈ 0.1c.

So velocity is about 0.1c. In non-relativistic, v is small compared to c, but 0.1c is not that small, so non-relativistic approximation might not be that great. But perhaps the difference is still small compared to the actual relativistic calculation.

But let's proceed.

So, T1 (non-relativistic) is (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m) v1².

We know from earlier that m v1² = 1 GeV, so 2m v1² = 2 GeV. So,

T1_nonrel = 2 GeV.

Wait, because m v1² = 1 GeV. So 2m v1² = 2 GeV. So T1_nonrel is (1/2)(2m) v1² = (m v1²) = 1 GeV? Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, T1_nonrel is (1/2) m1 v1².

m1 is 2m, so (1/2) (2m) v1² = m v1².

From earlier, m v1² = 1 GeV/c², because 0.33 M v1² = 1 GeV, and M is 300 GeV/c². So 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² is 99 GeV/c². So (99 GeV/c²) * v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) → v1² c² = (1 GeV c²) / 99 GeV = c² /99.

So, m v1² = (0.33 M) * (c²/99) ) → But M c² is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c². So,

0.33 * (300 GeV / c²) * (c²/99) ) = (99 GeV / c²) * (c²/99) ) = 1 GeV.

Wait, so m v1² = 1 GeV.

So T1_nonrel = m v1² = 1 GeV.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV? But the total KE is 3 GeV.

Wait, because m1 contributes 2m v1² / 2 → m v1², and m2 contributes m (2 v1)^2 /2 → m*4 v1² / 2 → 2 m v1². So total is 3 m v1² =3 GeV. Which matches. So, T1_nonrel is m v1² =1 GeV.

Wait, but let me check:

Wait, T1_nonrel is (1/2)*m1*v1² = (1/2)*(2m)*(v1²) = m v1². And T2_nonrel is (1/2)*m2*v2² = (1/2)*m*(4 v1²) )= 2 m v1². So T1 is 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV. Okay, makes sense.

Now, what is the relativistic case? Let's compute T1_rel = K1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

In the relativistic case, the energy of each fragment is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. So, E1 = m1 c² + K1, and E2 = m2 c^2 + K2.

Conservation of energy: M c² = E1 + E2.

But E1 + E2 = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2 = 0.99 M c² + 3 GeV.

Which matches M c² = 300 GeV, since 0.99 *300 =297 GeV, plus 3 GeV is 300 GeV.

But how to find K1?

We have two equations:

1) gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

2) gamma1 m1 c^2 + gamma2 m2 c^2 = 3 GeV + (m1 + m2)c^2.

Wait, no: the initial energy is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest energies is 0.99 M c^2 = 297 GeV. So the KE is 3 GeV.

Wait, earlier I thought that the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So,

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

We also have the momentum conservation equation: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of beta and gamma, or use the relation between the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a two-body problem in relativity.

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the nucleus, the two fragments move with velocities v1 and v2 such that their momenta are equal and opposite. So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 = p.

But this might get complicated, so perhaps we can use the relation between the energies and the masses.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the velocities of the two fragments. Since the nucleus is at rest, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. So, the magnitude of their momenta are the same.

So, p1 = p2.

But p = gamma m v.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But we also know that m1 = 2 m2, since m1 is twice as massive as m2.

So, substituting m1 = 2 m2:

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Dividing both sides by m2,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Now, since the system's total energy is conserved,

E_total = M c² = (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2) c².

But M c² is 300 GeV, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → 0.99 *300=297 GeV.

So, 300 GeV = (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2) c².

Wait, no. Wait, E1 = gamma1 m1 c² and E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

So, E1 + E2 = gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c².

Which equals M c².

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) + gamma2 m2 = M.

Factor out m2,

m2 (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = M.

But m2 is 0.33 M.

So,

0.33 M (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = M.

Divide both sides by M,

0.33 (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = 1 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 1/0.33 ≈ 3.0303.

So equation (A): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.0303.

From the momentum equation,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Let me denote equation (B): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So, we have two equations (A and B) involving gamma1, gamma2, v1, v2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps we can relate the velocities using beta.

Let me denote beta1 = v1 / c, beta2 = v2 / c.

Then, from equation (B),

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But we also have the energy equation:

gamma1 (2 m2) + gamma2 m2 = M.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to let m2 = m, so m1 = 2m. Then,

gamma1 (2m) + gamma2 m = M → gamma1 2m + gamma2 m = M → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = M/(m).

But m is 0.33 M, so M/m = 3.0303.

Thus,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Equation (A) still holds.

From equation (B):

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta is v/c, so v = beta c.

Also, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Hmm, perhaps we can express beta2 in terms of beta1.

From equation (B):

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta2^2).

So,

beta2 / sqrt(1 - beta2^2) = 2 gamma1 beta1.

Hmm, perhaps we can write in terms of beta1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that beta1 and beta2 are related, but this seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities of the two fragments are such that the more massive fragment (m1) is moving slower than the lighter one (m2), which is consistent with the mass being higher for m1.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I can consider that for the more massive fragment, m1, the velocity is much lower, so its gamma is approximately 1, and for m2, it's moving faster, so gamma is higher. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, but in this case, the initial nucleus has 300 GeV, and the released energy is 3 GeV, which is much less than 300 GeV. So maybe the velocities are non-relativistic, and we can use the non-relativistic approximation. But then why the problem is asking about the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic cases?

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV. Let's think about the relativistic case. Maybe the kinetic energy is higher or lower.

Wait, let me think about what happens when a nucleus fissions.

In reality, the fragments move apart with significant speeds, but perhaps not at relativistic speeds. But in this problem, the initial nucleus is at rest, and the fragments have a significant amount of kinetic energy (3 GeV compared to their rest masses), so perhaps the velocities are not negligible.

But perhaps I can make some approximations.

Let me consider that the more massive fragment (m1 = 0.66 M) has a velocity v1, and the lighter fragment (m2=0.33 M) has velocity v2.

Conservation of momentum:

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → (0.66 M) v1 = (0.33 M) v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

Conservation of energy:

(0.66 M) (1 + (v1²)/(2 c²)) ) + (0.33 M) (1 + (v2²)/(2 c²)) ) ) = M.

Wait, no, that's the non-relativistic approximation for energy. But since the problem says to compare with the classical (non-relativistic) case, I'll proceed.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach is better. Let me use relativistic expressions.

The energy of each fragment is E1 = gamma1 m1 c², E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

Conservation of energy:

E1 + E2 = M c².

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M. (Divided both sides by c².)

We have m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So,

gamma1 (0.66 M) + gamma2 (0.33 M) = M.

Divide both sides by M,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals:

66 gamma1 + 33 gamma2 = 100.

So equation (1): 66 gamma1 + 33 gamma2 = 100.

From momentum conservation:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Which is,

gamma1 (0.66 M) v1 = gamma2 (0.33 M) v2.

Divide both sides by M,

0.66 gamma1 v1 = 0.33 gamma2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So,

v2 = (2 gamma1 v1) / gamma2.

But I can express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c.

So,

v1 = beta1 c,

v2 = beta2 c.

So,

beta2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / gamma2.

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So,

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta1²),

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta2²).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make an assumption to simplify.

Assume that beta1 is small, so gamma1 is approximately 1 + (1/2) beta1².

Similarly, beta2 may not be that small, but perhaps I can find an approximate solution.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, given the time I'm taking, maybe I can think of the problem in another way. Let me consider that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and the more massive fragment's KE is T1, which is a fraction of 3 GeV. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of mass defect. The initial mass is M, and the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So, the energy released is 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

But how is this energy distributed between the two kinetic energies?

In the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment (m1) had T1 = 1 GeV, and the lighter (m2) had T2 =2 GeV.

But in reality, the relativistic effect would make the kinetic energies different.

Wait, perhaps the relativistic calculation will show that the more massive fragment has less kinetic energy than the non-relativistic case. Because in relativity, higher mass leads to lower kinetic energy for the same momentum.

Hmm, so the difference between T1_rel and T1_nonrel would be the amount by which the relativistic calculation is lower than the non-relativistic one.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose two objects of masses m and 2m, with momentum p each, but opposite directions. The kinetic energy for each in relativity is higher than in non-relativistic when velocity is a significant fraction of c.

Wait, but when m is larger, the same momentum p would correspond to a lower velocity. So, higher mass → lower velocity for same p, which would mean lower kinetic energy.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be (p²)/(2 m1) and (p²)/(2 m2). Since m1 is twice m2, K1_nonrel = p²/(2 m1) = p²/(4 m2), and K2_nonrel = p²/(2 m2). So, K2 is twice K1. So, T1_nonrel is 1 GeV, T2_nonrel is 2 GeV, as I found earlier.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

But since p = gamma m v, and gamma = p / (m v), perhaps I can write K in terms of p.

Hmm, perhaps it's time to look for a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the kinetic energies in the non-relativistic and relativistic cases.

In non-relativistic, T1_nonrel = 1 GeV, T2_nonrel =2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the KEs would be higher because of the gamma factor.

Wait, no. Because, for the same momentum, higher mass would lead to lower velocity, and lower KE. So, perhaps T1_rel is less than T1_nonrel.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can consider that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should instead look for the ratio of the kinetic energies.

Wait, let me consider that the momentum p is the same for both fragments (in magnitude), but opposite in direction.

So, p = gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Let me write v in terms of beta: v = beta c.

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So,

( m1 beta1 ) / sqrt(1 - beta1^2 ) = ( m2 beta2 ) / sqrt(1 - beta2^2 ).

Hmm.

But this is getting too complex. Maybe I can make an approximation by assuming that the velocities are not too high, so beta is small. But earlier, in the non-relativistic case, v1 was about 0.1 c, which isn't that small. So perhaps the approximation isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment has a lower KE.

So, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic T1 would be the amount that T1 is lower in the relativistic case.

Wait, but the options are in the range of a few MeV. So, 2, 5, 10, 20 MeV. So the difference is a small fraction of a GeV.

Wait, the non-relativistic case gave T1_nonrel =1 GeV. If the relativistic case is less, the difference would be 1 GeV - T1_rel.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can think of the problem in terms of invariant mass.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for two-body decay. But I'm not very familiar with it, so perhaps I can look for an alternative approach.

Wait, let's think in terms of the velocity of the center of mass.

Wait, no, because the initial nucleus is at rest, the center of mass is the same as the initial frame.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the relation between the kinetic energy and the rest mass.

In the case of two-body decay, the maximum kinetic energy is when one of the fragments is at rest, but that's not our case here.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps I can find the ratio of the kinetic energies.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote the velocities as v and u for the two fragments.

So, m1 v = m2 u.

And, the total KE is K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic, K1 = m1 v² / 2, K2 = m2 u²/2.

But with m1 = 2 m2, and u = 2 v.

So, K1 = (2 m2) v² /2 = m2 v².

K2 = m2 (4 v²) / 2 = 2 m2 v².

So, K1 + K2 =3 m2 v² =3 GeV → m2 v² =1 GeV.

Thus, K1_nonrel =1 GeV.

Now, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So, for each fragment, K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

And,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between the velocities.

From momentum conservation,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m1 =2 m2.

So,

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Divide both sides by gamma2,

v2 = (2 gamma1 v1) / gamma2.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I can make the assumption that the velocities are such that the kinetic energies are small compared to the rest mass energy. But in this case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and the rest mass energies are about 200 GeV (for m1) and 100 GeV (for m2), so 3 GeV is about 1.5% of the rest mass energy. So perhaps we can use a Taylor expansion for gamma.

Gamma can be approximated as 1 + (1/2) beta² + ... for small beta.

So,

gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, for each fragment,

gamma1 ≈ 1 + (v1²)/(2 c²),

gamma2 ≈ 1 + (v2²)/(2 c²).

Now, the energy equation:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Substitute m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M,

gamma1 (0.66 M) + gamma2 (0.33 M) = M.

Divide through by M,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

Using the approximation,

0.66 [1 + (v1²)/(2 c²)] + 0.33 [1 + (v2²)/(2 c²)] ≈ 1.

Expanding,

0.66 + 0.66 (v1²)/(2 c²) + 0.33 + 0.33 (v2²)/(2 c²) ≈1.

0.66 + 0.33 = 0.99, so,

0.99 + [0.66 (v1²) + 0.33 (v2²)]/(2 c²) ≈1.

Subtract 0.99,

[0.66 (v1²) + 0.33 (v2²)]/(2 c²) ≈ 0.01.

Multiply both sides by 2 c²,

0.66 v1² + 0.33 v2² ≈ 0.02 c².

Now, from momentum conservation,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 0.66 M v1 = 0.33 M v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

So, v2 = 2 v1.

Substitute into the equation,

0.66 v1² + 0.33 (4 v1²) ≈ 0.02 c².

So,

0.66 v1² + 1.32 v1² = 2 v1² ≈ 0.02 c².

So,

v1² ≈ (0.02 c²)/2 = 0.01 c².

Thus,

v1 ≈ 0.1 c.

Which matches our earlier non-relativistic result.

Now, using this approximation, let's compute gamma1 and gamma2.

gamma1 ≈ 1 + (v1²)/(2 c²) = 1 + (0.01 c²)/(2 c²) = 1 + 0.005 = 1.005.

Similarly, v2=0.2 c,

gamma2 ≈ 1 + (0.04 c²)/(2 c²) = 1 + 0.02 =1.02.

Now, compute the kinetic energies:

K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c² ≈ (0.005) * (0.66 M) c².

M c² is 300 GeV. So,

0.66 *300 GeV * 0.005 = 0.66 *1.5 GeV = 0.99 GeV, approximately 1 GeV.

Similarly, K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c² ≈ (0.02) * 0.33 *300 GeV.

0.33 *300 =99 GeV. 99 *0.02=1.98 GeV.

So, K1 ≈1 GeV, K2≈2 GeV, which matches the non-relativistic case.

But wait, that can't be. If the approximation is this close, then the relativistic and non-relativistic cases are almost the same. So the difference would be negligible, which is not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic T1 as around 5 MeV or so.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that the velocities are small is making the relativistic and non-relativistic cases too similar.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the exact relativistic solution without the approximation.

Let me go back to the initial equations.

Equation 1: 66 gamma1 + 33 gamma2 =100.

Equation 2: 2 gamma1 v1 =gamma2 v2.

But v2 =2 v1, from momentum.

So,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (2 v1).

Canceling 2 v1 from both sides,

gamma1 = gamma2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no,

Wait, equation 2: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Since v2 = 2 v1,

so,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (2 v1).

Divide both sides by 2 v1,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma1 = gamma2.

That's a key insight! So, both fragments have the same gamma factor.

So, from equation 1:

66 gamma1 +33 gamma1 =100 →99 gamma1 =100 →gamma1 =100/99 ≈1.010101.

So, gamma is approximately 1.0101.

Thus, each fragment's gamma is about 1.0101.

So, the velocity beta can be found from gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta^2).

So,

gamma^2 = 1/(1-beta^2) → beta^2=1 - (1/gamma^2).

gamma=100/99 → gamma^2=10000/9801 ≈1.0203.

So,

beta^2=1 - (9801/10000) = (10000-9801)/10000 = 199/10000 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.0199) ≈0.141.

So, beta≈0.141, v≈0.141 c.

Now, compute the kinetic energy for the more massive fragment, m1.

K1 = (gamma -1) m1 c².

gamma=100/99≈1.0101.

So,

K1 = (0.010101) * m1 c².

m1=0.66 M.

M c²=300 GeV.

So,

K1=0.010101 * 0.66 *300 GeV.

0.66 *300 =198 GeV.

198 *0.010101≈2 GeV.

So, K1≈2 GeV.

Wait, but earlier in non-relativistic case, K1 was 1 GeV. So in the relativistic case, K1 is about 2 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because with higher mass, you would expect lower velocity and hence lower kinetic energy. But here, the relativistic case gives higher K1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Because the assumption that gamma1=gamma2 comes from equation 2 and the fact that v2=2 v1.

Wait, let's re-express equation 2 correctly.

Wait, equation (B): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 0.66 M v1 = 0.33 M v2 → v2=2 v1.

So, equation (B) becomes 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (2 v1).

Canceling 2 v1,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So yes, gamma1=gamma2.

So, both have the same gamma.

So, in the relativistic case, gamma is about 1.0101.

So, K1 = (gamma-1) m1 c².

m1 c² =0.66 M c²=0.66 *300=198 GeV.

So,

K1 = (0.010101) *198 ≈2.000 GeV.

Similarly, K2=(gamma-1) m2 c² =0.010101 * 99 GeV≈1.000 GeV.

So, K1=2 GeV, K2=1 GeV.

Wait, but K1 + K2=3 GeV, which matches the total.

But in the non-relativistic case, K1 was 1 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

So, the relativistic case has K1=2 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic case of 1 GeV.

So, the difference T1_rel - T1_nonrel =2 GeV -1 GeV=1 GeV.

But the options are in the range of MeV, so this can't be right.

Wait, but wait, this suggests a difference of 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that gamma1=gamma2.

Let me recheck that.

From equation (B), 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But v2=2 v1.

So,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (2 v1) → gamma1 = gamma2.

Hmm, that seems correct.

But then, in the relativistic case, K1 is 2 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic 1 GeV.

But the options are much smaller. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, in the relativistic case, gamma is 100/99, so (gamma-1)=0.010101.

m1 c² is 198 GeV.

So, K1=0.010101 *198≈2 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that gamma1=gamma2. Because in reality, the two fragments have different masses, so their velocities would be different, leading to different gammas.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, from the equations, gamma1 must equal gamma2.

Hmm.

But according to the problem statement, the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is one of the options, which are in the range of a few MeV.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energies are higher, but the options are small. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me go back.

Wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass energy of 300 GeV.

After fission, the sum of the rest mass energies is 99% of M, so 297 GeV.

The mass defect is 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy.

So, the total KE is 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel was 1 GeV, K2_nonrel 2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, according to the earlier calculation, K1_rel=2 GeV, K2_rel=1 GeV.

So, the difference between T1_rel (2 GeV) and T1_nonrel (1 GeV) is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are much smaller, so clearly I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the equations.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that gamma1=gamma2 is incorrect.

Wait, let me re-express equation (B).

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1 v1) / m2.

Substituting into equation (B):

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 (m1 v1 / m2).

Simplify:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m1 v1.

Cancel m1 v1 from both sides,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, the earlier conclusion that gamma1=gamma2 is correct.

Thus, that part is correct.

Hmm, but then the relativistic calculation leads to K1 being higher than the non-relativistic case, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.

Wait, let's compute K1_rel again.

gamma = 100/99 ≈1.010101.

K1 = (gamma -1) m1 c².

m1 c²=0.66 M c²=0.66 *300=198 GeV.

So,

K1 = (0.010101) *198 ≈ 2 GeV.

Hmm.

But in reality, the non-relativistic case gave K1_nonrel=1 GeV, and the relativistic case gives K1_rel=2 GeV. So the difference would be 1 GeV. But the options are in the MeV range. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe I confused the more massive fragment. Because m1 is the more massive, it has K1=2 GeV, which is more than the non-relativistic case. But the question asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So, in this case, the relativistic T1 is larger by 1 GeV. But the options are smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining which fragment's KE is which. Maybe K1 is the lighter fragment's KE.

Wait, no. The problem states that T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1. So, K1 is for m1, which is 2 GeV in the relativistic case.

But the non-relativistic case gives K1_nonrel=1 GeV.

So, the difference is 1 GeV.

But the options are nowhere near this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of gamma.

Equation 1: 66 gamma1 +33 gamma2=100.

But if gamma1=gamma2,

66 gamma +33 gamma=99 gamma=100 → gamma=100/99≈1.010101.

That's correct.

So the calculation seems correct, but the result doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a fundamental mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach: Since the nucleus is at rest, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta.

So, p1 = -p2.

The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

The kinetic energy in relativity is K = (gamma - 1) m c².

So, K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

We have,

K1 + K2 =3 GeV = (gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

But also,

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And, p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But v = beta c.

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Hmm.

Let me express beta in terms of gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Substituting beta,

gamma1 m1 sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)) = gamma2 m2 sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

This equation might be complicated, but perhaps I can make an assumption.

Let me assume that gamma1 is much larger than 1, but that's not the case here because gamma≈1.01.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between the two gammas.

Let me denote gamma1=gamma2=gamma.

As earlier, from the momentum equation, gamma1=gamma2=gamma.

So,

K1 + K2 = (gamma -1)(m1 + m2) c² = (gamma -1)(0.99 M) c² =3 GeV.

But 0.99 M c²=297 GeV.

So,

(gamma -1)*297 GeV =3 GeV → gamma-1=3/297 ≈0.010101 → gamma≈1.0101.

Which is the same result as before.

So, K1= (gamma-1) m1 c² =0.010101 *198 GeV=2 GeV.

So, the relativistic T1 is 2 GeV, while the non-relativistic is 1 GeV.

The difference is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the non-relativistic case.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, I found T1_nonrel=1 GeV, but perhaps I should have found a different value.

Let me re-examine the non-relativistic case.

In non-relativistic, the momenta must be equal and opposite.

m1 v1 =m2 v2.

K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

K1 = (1/2)m1 v1^2,

K2=(1/2)m2 v2^2.

With m2=0.33 M, m1=0.66 M.

So,

(1/2)(0.66 M) v1^2 + (1/2)(0.33 M) v2^2 =3 GeV.

But m1 v1 =m2 v2 → 0.66 M v1 =0.33 M v2 → v2=2 v1.

Substituting,

(1/2)(0.66 M) v1^2 + (1/2)(0.33 M)(4 v1^2) =3 GeV.

Simplify:

(0.33 M v1²) + (0.66 M v1²) ) =3 GeV → 0.99 M v1²=3 GeV.

But M is 300 GeV/c², so,

0.99 *300 GeV/c² * v1^2 =3 GeV.

Divided both sides by GeV,

0.99 *300 (v1^2 / c²) )=3.

So,

v1^2/c^2 =3/(0.99 *300) )=3/(297) ≈0.010101.

v1= c*sqrt(0.010101)= c*0.1005.

So, v1≈0.1005 c.

Now, K1_nonrel=(1/2) m1 v1^2 =0.5 *0.66 M * v1^2.

M is 300 GeV/c², v1²=0.010101 c².

So,

K1_nonrel=0.5 *0.66 *300 GeV/c² *0.010101 c².

Compute this:

0.5 *0.66 *300 ≈0.33 *300=99 GeV.

99 *0.010101≈1 GeV.

So, K1_nonrel=1 GeV.

So the non-relativistic case is correct.

But the relativistic case gives K1_rel=2 GeV. So the difference is 1 GeV. But the options are much smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that gamma is the same for both fragments.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, gamma1 must equal gamma2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumption. Is there a possibility that the assumption gamma1=gamma2 is incorrect?

Let me think again.

From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m1 v1 =m2 v2 → v2= (m1 v1)/m2.

Substituting into the momentum equation,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 (m1 v1 / m2).

Simplify:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m1 v1.

Cancel m1 v1,

gamma1=gamma2.

So, the conclusion is correct.

Thus, the earlier calculation stands, leading to a difference of 1 GeV, which is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think: the problem says to ignore electrons. Does that imply that the fragments are charged, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M is leading to a mass defect of 1% (3 GeV). But in reality, the binding energy is released, which could be more than the rest mass difference. But perhaps the problem statement treats it as a simple mass defect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the relativistic calculation. Let me think differently.

Let me calculate the relativistic kinetic energy using exact expressions.

We have two fragments with m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

Total energy after fission: E1 + E2 = M c².

E1=gamma1 m1 c²,

E2=gamma2 m2 c².

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

Momentum conservation: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But, from rest frame, the initial momentum is zero, so their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But from the rest frame, the velocities are such that the momenta balance.

But perhaps it's better to consider the velocity of the fragments in terms of the masses and the energy.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for two-body decay, where the velocities can be found using the following approach.

The energy of each fragment is E1 and E2.

The velocity of each fragment can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2).

So, beta1 = sqrt(1 - (m1 c²/E1)^2),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - (m2 c²/E2)^2).

But,

E1 + E2 = M c².

And,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → [E1/c²] v1 = [E2/c²] v2 → E1 v1 = E2 v2.

Hmm, but without knowing E1 and E2, this is difficult.

But perhaps I can express E2 in terms of E1: E2 = M c² - E1.

So,

E1 v1 = (M c² - E1) v2.

But,

v1 = c sqrt(1 - (m1² c^4)/(E1²)),

v2 = c sqrt(1 - (m2² c^4)/(E2²)).

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can make an assumption that E1 is much larger than m1 c², but in our case, E1 is about 200 GeV, and m1 c² is 198 GeV. So, E1 ≈ m1 c² + K1.

So, E1 ≈ m1 c² + K1.

Similarly, E2 ≈ m2 c² + K2.

But K_total is 3 GeV.

So, E1 = m1 c² + K1,

E2 = m2 c² + K2,

and K1 + K2=3 GeV.

Now, let's substitute these into the momentum equation.

E1 v1 = E2 v2.

But,

v1 = c sqrt(1 - (m1² c^4)/(E1^2)).

But E1 = m1 c^2 + K1.

Similarly for v2.

Let me approximate,

v1 ≈ c [1 - (m1² c^4)/(2 E1^2 ) ].

But,

E1 = m1 c² + K1,

so,

E1^2 = (m1 c^2)^2 + 2 m1 c^2 K1 + K1^2.

Assuming K1 is small compared to m1 c^2 (which it is, 2 GeV vs 198 GeV for m1 c^2), we can approximate E1^2 ≈ (m1 c^2)^2 + 2 m1 c^2 K1.

So,

v1 ≈ c [1 - (m1² c^4)/(2 (m1 c^2 + K1)^2 ) ].

= c [1 - (m1² c^4)/(2 (m1 c^2)^2 (1 + K1/(m1 c^2))^2 ) ]

= c [1 - 1/(2 (1 + K1/(m1 c^2))^2 ) ]

≈ c [1 - 1/2 (1 - 2 K1/(m1 c^2)) ) ].

= c [1 - 0.5 + (K1/(m1 c^2)) ) ]

= c [0.5 + (K1/(m1 c^2)) ) ].

Similarly,

v2 ≈ c [0.5 + (K2/(m2 c^2)) ) ].

Now, substituting into the momentum equation E1 v1 = E2 v2.

E1 = m1 c^2 + K1,

E2 = m2 c^2 + K2.

So,

(m1 c^2 + K1) [0.5 + (K1/(m1 c^2)) ] ≈ (m2 c^2 + K2) [0.5 + (K2/(m2 c^2)) ].

But since K1 + K2 =3 GeV,

Let me denote K1= x GeV,

so K2=3 -x GeV.

So,

(m1 c^2 +x) [0.5 + x/(m1 c^2) ] = (m2 c^2 + (3 -x)) [0.5 + (3 -x)/(m2 c^2) ].

Substituting m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M,

m1 c^2=0.66 *300=198 GeV,

m2 c^2=0.33 *300 =99 GeV.

So,

(198 + x) [0.5 + x/198 ] = (99 +3 -x) [0.5 + (3 -x)/99 ].

Simplify,

(198 +x) [0.5 + x/198 ] = (102 -x) [0.5 + (3 -x)/99 ].

Let's compute each side.

Left side:

(198 +x) [0.5 + (x/198) ]

= (198 +x) *0.5 + (198 +x) * (x/198 )

= 99 + 0.5x + (x^2)/198 + x^2/(198) ?

Wait, perhaps expanding more carefully:

= (198 +x) *0.5 + (198 +x) * (x/198 )

= [ (198)(0.5) + x(0.5) ] + [ (198 x)/198 + x^2/198 ]

= 99 + 0.5 x + x + (x^2)/198.

=99 + 1.5 x + (x^2)/198.

Right side:

(102 -x) [0.5 + (3 -x)/99 ]

= (102 -x)*0.5 + (102 -x)*(3 -x)/99.

Compute each term.

First term:

= 51 - 0.5 x.

Second term:

= [ (102)(3 -x) -x(3 -x) ] /99.

= [306 - 102 x - 3x +x^2 ] /99.

= [306 -105 x +x^2 ] /99.

So, right side becomes:

51 -0.5 x + [306 -105 x +x^2 ] /99.

Combine terms:

=51 -0.5x + (306/99) - (105 x)/99 + (x^2)/99.

=51 -0.5x +3.0909 -1.0606 x + 0.0101 x².

Combine like terms:

51 +3.0909 ≈54.0909,

-0.5x -1.0606 x ≈-1.5606 x,

and +0.0101 x².

So, right side≈54.0909 -1.5606 x +0.0101 x².

Now, set left side equal to right side:

99 +1.5x + (x²)/198 ≈54.0909 -1.5606 x +0.0101 x².

Bring all terms to left side:

99 +1.5x + (x²)/198 -54.0909 +1.5606 x -0.0101 x² ≈0.

Compute each term:

99 -54.0909 ≈44.909,

1.5x +1.5606 x ≈3.0606 x,

(x²)/198 -0.0101 x² ≈ (0.005050505 -0.0101) x² ≈-0.005049495 x².

So,

44.909 +3.0606 x -0.005049495 x² ≈0.

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

449090 +30606 x -50.49495 x² =0.

Arrange:

-50.49495 x² +30606 x +449090=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

50.49495 x² -30606 x -449090=0.

Now, solving this quadratic equation for x.

Use quadratic formula:

x = [30606 ± sqrt( (30606)^2 +4*50.49495*449090 ) ]/(2 *50.49495).

Compute discriminant:

D = (30606)^2 +4*50.49495*449090.

First, compute (30606)^2.

30606^2 = (3e4)^2 =approx 9.36e8, but precise calculation:

30606 *30606.

But given time constraints, perhaps approximate.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that the terms are large, but the equation is probably designed to give x≈1.5 GeV.

Let me plug x=1.5 GeV into the equation.

Left side: 50.49495*(1.5)^2 -30606*(1.5) -449090.

=50.49495*2.25 -45909 -449090.

=113.113 -45909 -449090 ≈-498,  so not zero.

Hmm, perhaps x=2 GeV.

50.49495*(4) =201.9798,

-30606 *2= -61212,

-449090.

Total: 201.9798 -61212 -449090 ≈-509,  which is negative.

x=3 GeV.

50.49495*(9)=454.4545,

-30606*3= -91818,

-449090.

Total:454.45 -91818 -449090≈-540, so negative.

Hmm, perhaps x=0.5 GeV.

50.49495*(0.25)=12.6237,

-30606*0.5= -15303,

-449090.

Total:12.6237 -15303 -449090≈-464, negative.

Hmm, maybe the equation isn't working. Perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic cases is small, around a few MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of K1_rel and K1_nonrel and find the difference.

Earlier, in the relativistic case, K1_rel=2 GeV, non-relativistic 1 GeV, so difference 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are in the range of 2-20 MeV.

So, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that gamma1=gamma2. It's possible that this assumption is incorrect, leading to a larger gamma and thus a larger K1.

But I'm stuck, and the time is limited, so perhaps I should look for the intended approach.

Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is A) 2 MeV.

But I'm not sure. Since in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is higher by about 1 GeV, which is not an option, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest masses is 99% of that, which is 297 GeV.

The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has T1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, perhaps the more massive fragment has a lower T1, leading to a difference of about 5 MeV.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the difference in the kinetic energies using relativistic and non-relativistic formulas.

In non-relativistic,

T1_nonrel = (m1 v1²)/2.

In relativistic,

T1_rel = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

The difference is T1_rel - T1_nonrel.

But gamma1 =1 + (p^2)/(2 m1^2 c^2), approximately, for small p.

Wait, perhaps the difference is small, and can be approximated as the difference between the two expressions.

But without knowing the exact value of v, it's hard. So perhaps the answer is B)5 MeV.

The problem involves an atomic nucleus of rest-mass energy 300 GeV undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other. The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, leaving a mass defect of 1%, or 3 GeV, converted into kinetic energy. The task is to determine the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Mass Distribution**:
   - Let the smaller fragment's rest mass be \( m \). Then, the larger fragment's rest mass is \( 2m \).
   - The total rest mass of the fragments is \( 3m = 0.99M \), where \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Solving gives \( m = 0.33M \) and \( 2m = 0.66M \).

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Thus, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
     \[
     \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2
     \]
     where \( \gamma_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_i^2/c^2}} \).

3. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the fragments:  
     \[
     M c^2 = (m_1 + m_2) c^2 + K_1 + K_2
     \]
     Substituting \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), the total kinetic energy is:  
     \[
     K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

4. **Non-Relativistic Case**:
   - Using classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of each fragment is:  
     \[
     K_{\text{non-rel}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
     \]
     From momentum conservation, \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), and substituting \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), the kinetic energies are:  
     \[
     K_1^{\text{non-rel}} = 1 \, \text{GeV}, \quad K_2^{\text{non-rel}} = 2 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

5. **Relativistic Case**:
   - The relativistic kinetic energy is:  
     \[
     K_{\text{rel}} = (\gamma - 1) m c^2,
     \]
     where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Using the conservation equations and approximations for small velocities, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated to be slightly higher than the non-relativistic case.

6. **Difference Between Cases**:
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be approximately \( 2 \, \text{GeV} \), while the non-relativistic value is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), which is \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \). However, the options provided are much smaller (2, 5, 10, 20 MeV). This suggests a subtle error in the relativistic calculation or an assumption that the difference is negligible compared to the total energy.

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer is that the difference is approximately \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \).
