Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me see.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. Wait, but I remember that in relativity, the concept of mass is a bit tricky. I think we talk about rest mass and relativistic mass. Oh wait, no, sometimes it's better to consider four-momentum or use the relativistic addition formulas. But wait, I'm not sure if they just want the sum of their energies or something else.

Wait, the speeds they're moving at are 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction, the positive x. So from Earth's frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. But the question is about their relative speed. Because in relativity, the relative speeds don't just add up normally. Oh right! So the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because of the way velocities transform in relativity.

So I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The relative velocity would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. That's one of the options.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, so each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total energy is the sum of both. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, wait, but the masses are 2m and 3m. So for astronaut A, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma for A would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * m_A * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the formula is gamma * m c². So for 2m, it's 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c²? Or wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think. Because the rest energy is m c². So if the mass is 2m, then rest energy is 2m c². Then, when moving, it's gamma times that. So yeah, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma for B is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² = approximately 1.1547 * 3 m c². Let me calculate that: 1.1547 *3 is about 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. For gamma A: 0.6c. So (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt is 0.8, so 1/0.8 is 1.25. Yep. So E_A is 2m *1.25 c²=2.5 mc².

Gamma B: 0.5c. (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So 3m *1.1547 c² = 3.464 mc². Add 2.5 and 3.464: that's 5.964, which is about 5.96.

So the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Yes, that matches. So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(2m\)) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(3m\)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the astronaut with mass \(2m\) and speed \(0.6c\):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the astronaut with mass \(3m\) and speed \(0.5c\):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
