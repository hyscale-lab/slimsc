Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically about creating a transgenic mouse model. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The researcher wants to study GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're making a transgenic mouse where this protein is overexpressed. Oh wait, but they're using an inducible system, so the overexpression is controlled. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, which is a common method for transfecting cells with plasmids.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. They checked the construct's sequence and found something wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The HA tag sequence has a missense mutation. So like, the HA epitope might not be correctly formed. If the tag is messed up, maybe the protein isn't recognized for purification, but the question says they couldn't overexpress, so maybe it's about expression, not purification. Hmm.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. So if the construct has a stop codon (like TAA, TAG, or TGA) somewhere before the end, the protein would be truncated. Let me look at the given DNA sequence. The sequence is the plus strand, so the coding sequence is from ATG to the end. Let me scan for any stop codons in the mRNA.

Wait, mRNA is the template for translation, so it's the complement of the DNA. The DNA sequence is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same as the DNA but with T replaced by U. So looking for UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA.

Looking through the DNA sequence, the last part is ... ATGAG... but wait, let's go through in segments. Let me look for TGA in the DNA, which would be UGA in mRNA, a stop codon. Or any other stop codons.

Wait, the sequence is quite long. Let me see. The last part is ... TGA ... I think I see a TGA in the DNA. Let me check.

Looking at the end of the sequence:

...GAGTGA3'

Right there, the last few bases are GAG TGA. Wait, the TGA is in the DNA. So when transcribed into mRNA, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the DNA construct has a TGA in the coding sequence, which would lead the mRNA to have UGA, a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop early, meaning the protein is shorter than expected.

Wait, but is this part of the original gene or an added sequence? The construct includes a HA tag at the N-terminus. So in the DNA, after the ATG start, the HA sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence. But if the HA tag is added correctly, then the construct should have the ATG followed by HA, then the gene.

Wait, the given DNA sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the construct's sequence starts correctly. But then, somewhere in the middle or end, the TGA appears.

Wait, looking at the given DNA, the last part is TGA. So in the mRNA, that's UGA, which is a stop codon. So the gene would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. If the construct has an unintended stop codon, the ribosome would terminate early, so the protein isn't expressed properly. That would explain why overexpression isn't happening.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be due to a premature stop codon. So the presence of a UGA in the mRNA would cause that. So option B is a possibility.

Option C: No linker, so the protein is degraded. Linkers are usually for proper folding or preventing degradation, but the question is about overexpression. If the protein isn't made, it's possible that the problem is in expression, not in degradation. But maybe the lack of a linker makes the protein unstable, so even if it's made, it's quickly broken down. But the question states they couldn't overexpress, which suggests the issue is in production, not in stability. So maybe C is not the main issue here.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon in mRNA. The tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons; release factors do. So the tRNA issue is not relevant here. D is probably wrong.

So the issue is the presence of a premature stop codon in the construct's DNA, leading to early termination. Looking at the DNA sequence, I see a TGA near the end. So when transcribed, it's UGA. So the mRNA would have a stop codon before the intended end, making the protein shorter or not expressed at all.

Wait, but the sequence given is the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA (except T to U). So the sequence includes the coding region, so the presence of TGA in the coding sequence would cause a stop. Therefore, the construct is introducing a premature stop codon, leading to early termination. So the ribosome stops translating early, so the protein isn't expressed as intended.

So the correct answer should be B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct is analyzed to identify the issue.

The DNA sequence starts with the ATG start codon and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag and GADD45G. Upon examination, a TGA triplet is observed near the end of the sequence. In the mRNA, this becomes UGA, which is a stop codon. The presence of this premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. This explains the failure to overexpress the protein as intended.

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence would affect purification but not necessarily prevent overexpression. This is unlikely to be the primary issue.
- **B)** The premature stop codon (UGA in mRNA) causes early termination of translation, preventing proper protein expression. This aligns with the observed failure to overexpress the protein.
- **C)** A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the issue here is the inability to express the protein, not its degradation after production.
- **D)** The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant because tRNA does not recognize stop codons; stop codons are decoded by release factors.

The most plausible explanation is the premature stop codon causing early ribosome termination, making **B** the correct answer.

Answer: B
