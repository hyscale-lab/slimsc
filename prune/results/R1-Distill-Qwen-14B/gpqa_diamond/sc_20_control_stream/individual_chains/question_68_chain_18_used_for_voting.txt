Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. So, mu is proportional to the z-component of the spin. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because the lowest energy state is when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off suddenly, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So, the field changes direction from Z to Y.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh right, when the magnetic field changes, the spin state will precess around the new field direction. Since spin is quantized, this precession should lead to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components.

Wait, I remember something called the Larmor frequency. That's related to the precession of magnetic moments in a magnetic field. The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma * B, right? But wait, the initial field was along Z, then turned off, and then the field is along Y. So the direction of the magnetic field changes from Z to Y.

Hmm, but in the first scenario, when the field is along Z, the spin is in an eigenstate of S_z. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would change. Oh, no, wait. The magnetic field is turned off, so the system's Hamiltonian would change. But wait, when the field is turned off, the particle's spin isn't interacting with a magnetic field anymore. Then, it's turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, because the magnetic field is along Y.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the torque is mu cross B. But the Hamiltonian for the spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. So in this case, when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.

So the system's Hamiltonian after the field change is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z.

The initial state, when the field was along Z, was an eigenstate of S_z, either up or down. Let's say it was up, so S_z is ħ/2. But when the Hamiltonian changes to H = gamma B S_y (with a negative sign, but the sign might not matter for the frequency), the state is no longer an eigenstate. So the system would evolve in time with this new Hamiltonian.

The time evolution of the expectation value of S_z would come from the time-dependent solution. The oscillation frequency should be determined by the energy difference between the states, which relates to the Larmor frequency.

Wait, the energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along Y would be E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2), because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so H would be proportional to those.

So the energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. The frequency omega is delta E / hbar, so omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value... Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, the system is in a state that's a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution would cause the expectation value to oscillate. The frequency is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = - (gamma B ħ)/2. So the difference is gamma B ħ. So omega = (E_+ - E_-) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along Y has energy levels E = ± (gamma B ħ/2). So the transition frequency between these states is (E_+ - E_-) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency should be gamma B. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

But wait, the original field was along Z, but after the field is turned off and on along Y, what's the initial state? Let's say the initial state was |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. When the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. The state |+z> can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y.

Eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>. So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). So when the Hamiltonian is H = omega_0 S_y, where omega_0 = gamma B, the time evolution would cause the state to precess around Y.

The time evolution of the state would be |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>. Let's compute H. Since H = gamma B S_y, and S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = (gamma B ħ /2) sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ /2) *1 and E_- = (gamma B ħ /2)* (-1). So the time evolution for a state |+y> would be exp(-i E_+ t / ħ), and similarly for |−y>.

Our initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). So the time-evolved state is (exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/ħ) |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

E_+ = gamma B ħ/2, so E_+ t/ħ = (gamma B/2) t. E_- is -gamma B ħ/2, so E_- t/ħ = - (gamma B/2) t.

So the state becomes [exp(-i gamma B t /2 ) |+y> + exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we can express this back in terms of the S_z basis to find the expectation value of S_z.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <S_z> as a function of time.

Expressing S_z in terms of |+z> and |−z>, but perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

We know that <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But maybe a better approach is to recall that for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along some direction, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time. The frequency of this oscillation is given by the energy splitting divided by ħ, which is the Larmor frequency.

Wait, for a magnetic field along Y, the spin precesses around Y. The expectation value of S_z would oscillate as the spin vector rotates around Y. The angular frequency of this precession is the same as the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. The Larmor frequency is usually omega = gamma B, which is the same as the energy difference divided by ħ. So, the time dependence of the expectation values is at this frequency.

But wait, let me think again. The time evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H = gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are E = ± gamma B ħ / 2.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ). So, in the basis of |+y> and |−y>, the state evolves with phases exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) and exp(-i E_- t / ħ ), respectively.

The time-dependent state is a superposition of these. To find <S_z>, let's compute it.

Express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2)

So, the time-evolved state |psi(t)> is [ exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2) ) ].

Simplify this:

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

1/sqrt(2) [ exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + |−z>) + exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - |−z>) ) ]

Combine like terms:

= 1/sqrt(2) [ ( exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) + exp(i gamma B t/2 ) ) |+z> + ( exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) - exp(i gamma B t/2 ) ) |−z> ]

We can compute the coefficients using Euler's formula. Let's compute each part.

exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ
exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ

So,

= 1/sqrt(2) [ 2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |−z> ]

Factor out 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2):

= sqrt(2) [ cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |−z> ]

So, the state at time t is |psi(t)> = sqrt(2) [ cos(omega t/2) |+z> + i sin(omega t/2) |−z> ] where omega = gamma B.

Now, to find <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |−z>.

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |sqrt(2)|^2 [ cos^2(omega t/2) (ħ/2) + sin^2(omega t/2) ( - ħ/2 ) ]

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Wait, S_z acting on |+z> gives (ħ/2)|+z>, and on |−z> gives (-ħ/2)|−z>.

So the expectation value is:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ sqrt(2) ( cos(omega t/2 ) < +z | + i sin(omega t/2 ) < -z | ) ] * S_z * [ sqrt(2) ( cos(omega t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(omega t/2 ) |−z> ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

Let me compute the inner products. The state is a superposition of |+z> and |−z> with coefficients A cos(theta) and i A sin(theta), where A = sqrt(2), and theta = gamma B t/2.

So,

< S_z > = |A cos(theta)|^2 (ħ/2) + |A i sin(theta)|^2 (- ħ/2 )

Because when you have a state a |+z> + b |−z>, the expectation of S_z is |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2).

So, |a|^2 = |A cos(theta)|^2 = A^2 cos^2(theta) = 2 cos²(theta)
Similarly, |b|^2 = |A i sin(theta)|^2 = A² sin²(theta) = 2 sin²(theta)

So,

< S_z > = 2 cos²(theta) (ħ/2) + 2 sin²(theta) (- ħ/2 )

Simplify:

= (2 * ħ/2) (cos²(theta) - sin²(theta)) )
= ħ ( cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) )
= ħ cos(2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta ) = cos²(theta) - sin²(theta).

So, <S_z> = ħ cos( 2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, <S_z> = ħ cos( gamma B t )

The time dependence is sinusoidal with frequency omega = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The expectation value is oscillating as cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z.

So, mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * [ ħ cos(gamma B t) ]

Wait, because <S_z> = ħ cos(gamma B t), so <mu_z> = gamma * ħ cos(gamma B t).

Wait no, wait. S_z has units of ħ. Because for spin 1/2, S_z is ± ħ/2.

So, the average of S_z is (ħ/2) [ 2 cos²(theta) - 1 ] ?

Wait no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.

Earlier, I found that <S_z> = ħ cos( gamma B t )

Wait, no, that can't be right because the maximum value of S_z is ħ/2. So, if <S_z> is oscillating between something larger than ħ/2, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, right. Let me go back.

Wait, earlier, I had <S_z> = ħ cos(2 theta ), and theta is (gamma B t)/2. So 2 theta is gamma B t.

But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake when computing the expectation value.

Let me redo the calculation.

The state is |psi(t)> = sqrt(2) [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z> ], where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

The expectation value of S_z is:

< S_z > = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [ sin(theta) ]^2 (- ħ/2 )

Because |a|^2 is cos^2(theta), and |b|^2 is sin^2(theta) for the coefficient i sin(theta) (since |i|^2 is 1).

So,

< S_z > = ( cos^2(theta) ) (ħ/2 ) + ( sin^2(theta) ) ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos( 2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

Theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

< S_z > = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The average of mu_z is gamma times the average of S_z.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So, the average mu_z oscillates with amplitude (gamma ħ/2 ) and frequency gamma B.

But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. So the frequency is gamma B.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is gamma*B.

So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$, say $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is turned off and reactivated along $+Y$, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:  
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
   \]
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i\omega_+ t} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\omega_- t} |-y\rangle \right),
   \]
   where $\omega_\pm = \pm \gamma B / 2$ are the energy eigenfrequencies.

3. **Expectation Value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   The magnetic moment $\mu_z$ is proportional to $S_z$, so $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting the time-evolved state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, it is found that:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ arises from the $\cos(\gamma B t)$ term, which has a frequency of $\gamma B$. This matches the Larmor frequency for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. So, mu is proportional to the z-component of the spin. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That makes sense because the lowest energy state is when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off suddenly, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So, the field changes direction from Z to Y.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh right, when the magnetic field changes, the spin state will precess around the new field direction. Since spin is quantized, this precession should lead to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components.

Wait, I remember something called the Larmor frequency. That's related to the precession of magnetic moments in a magnetic field. The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma * B, right? But wait, the initial field was along Z, then turned off, and then the field is along Y. So the direction of the magnetic field changes from Z to Y.

Hmm, but in the first scenario, when the field is along Z, the spin is in an eigenstate of S_z. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would change. Oh, no, wait. The magnetic field is turned off, so the system's Hamiltonian would change. But wait, when the field is turned off, the particle's spin isn't interacting with a magnetic field anymore. Then, it's turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, because the magnetic field is along Y.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the torque is mu cross B. But the Hamiltonian for the spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. So in this case, when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.

So the system's Hamiltonian after the field change is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z.

The initial state, when the field was along Z, was an eigenstate of S_z, either up or down. Let's say it was up, so S_z is ħ/2. But when the Hamiltonian changes to H = gamma B S_y (with a negative sign, but the sign might not matter for the frequency), the state is no longer an eigenstate. So the system would evolve in time with this new Hamiltonian.

The time evolution of the expectation value of S_z would come from the time-dependent solution. The oscillation frequency should be determined by the energy difference between the states, which relates to the Larmor frequency.

Wait, the energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along Y would be E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2), because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so H would be proportional to those.

So the energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. The frequency omega is delta E / hbar, so omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value... Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, the system is in a state that's a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution would cause the expectation value to oscillate. The frequency is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. So the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = - (gamma B ħ)/2. So the difference is gamma B ħ. So omega = (E_+ - E_-) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along Y has energy levels E = ± (gamma B ħ/2). So the transition frequency between these states is (E_+ - E_-) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency should be gamma B. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

But wait, the original field was along Z, but after the field is turned off and on along Y, what's the initial state? Let's say the initial state was |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. When the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. The state |+z> can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y.

Eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>. So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). So when the Hamiltonian is H = omega_0 S_y, where omega_0 = gamma B, the time evolution would cause the state to precess around Y.

The time evolution of the state would be |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>. Let's compute H. Since H = gamma B S_y, and S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = (gamma B ħ /2) sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ /2) *1 and E_- = (gamma B ħ /2)* (-1). So the time evolution for a state |+y> would be exp(-i E_+ t / ħ), and similarly for |−y>.

Our initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). So the time-evolved state is (exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/ħ) |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

E_+ = gamma B ħ/2, so E_+ t/ħ = (gamma B/2) t. E_- is -gamma B ħ/2, so E_- t/ħ = - (gamma B/2) t.

So the state becomes [exp(-i gamma B t /2 ) |+y> + exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, we can express this back in terms of the S_z basis to find the expectation value of S_z.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <S_z> as a function of time.

Expressing S_z in terms of |+z> and |−z>, but perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

We know that <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But maybe a better approach is to recall that for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field along some direction, the expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally with time. The frequency of this oscillation is given by the energy splitting divided by ħ, which is the Larmor frequency.

Wait, for a magnetic field along Y, the spin precesses around Y. The expectation value of S_z would oscillate as the spin vector rotates around Y. The angular frequency of this precession is the same as the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. The Larmor frequency is usually omega = gamma B, which is the same as the energy difference divided by ħ. So, the time dependence of the expectation values is at this frequency.

But wait, let me think again. The time evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H = gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are E = ± gamma B ħ / 2.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ). So, in the basis of |+y> and |−y>, the state evolves with phases exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) and exp(-i E_- t / ħ ), respectively.

The time-dependent state is a superposition of these. To find <S_z>, let's compute it.

Express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2)

So, the time-evolved state |psi(t)> is [ exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2) ) ].

Simplify this:

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

1/sqrt(2) [ exp(-i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + |−z>) + exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> - |−z>) ) ]

Combine like terms:

= 1/sqrt(2) [ ( exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) + exp(i gamma B t/2 ) ) |+z> + ( exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) - exp(i gamma B t/2 ) ) |−z> ]

We can compute the coefficients using Euler's formula. Let's compute each part.

exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ
exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ

So,

= 1/sqrt(2) [ 2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |−z> ]

Factor out 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2):

= sqrt(2) [ cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |−z> ]

So, the state at time t is |psi(t)> = sqrt(2) [ cos(omega t/2) |+z> + i sin(omega t/2) |−z> ] where omega = gamma B.

Now, to find <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |−z>.

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = |sqrt(2)|^2 [ cos^2(omega t/2) (ħ/2) + sin^2(omega t/2) ( - ħ/2 ) ]

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Wait, S_z acting on |+z> gives (ħ/2)|+z>, and on |−z> gives (-ħ/2)|−z>.

So the expectation value is:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ sqrt(2) ( cos(omega t/2 ) < +z | + i sin(omega t/2 ) < -z | ) ] * S_z * [ sqrt(2) ( cos(omega t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(omega t/2 ) |−z> ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

Let me compute the inner products. The state is a superposition of |+z> and |−z> with coefficients A cos(theta) and i A sin(theta), where A = sqrt(2), and theta = gamma B t/2.

So,

< S_z > = |A cos(theta)|^2 (ħ/2) + |A i sin(theta)|^2 (- ħ/2 )

Because when you have a state a |+z> + b |−z>, the expectation of S_z is |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2).

So, |a|^2 = |A cos(theta)|^2 = A^2 cos^2(theta) = 2 cos²(theta)
Similarly, |b|^2 = |A i sin(theta)|^2 = A² sin²(theta) = 2 sin²(theta)

So,

< S_z > = 2 cos²(theta) (ħ/2) + 2 sin²(theta) (- ħ/2 )

Simplify:

= (2 * ħ/2) (cos²(theta) - sin²(theta)) )
= ħ ( cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) )
= ħ cos(2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta ) = cos²(theta) - sin²(theta).

So, <S_z> = ħ cos( 2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, <S_z> = ħ cos( gamma B t )

The time dependence is sinusoidal with frequency omega = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The expectation value is oscillating as cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z.

So, mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * [ ħ cos(gamma B t) ]

Wait, because <S_z> = ħ cos(gamma B t), so <mu_z> = gamma * ħ cos(gamma B t).

Wait no, wait. S_z has units of ħ. Because for spin 1/2, S_z is ± ħ/2.

So, the average of S_z is (ħ/2) [ 2 cos²(theta) - 1 ] ?

Wait no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.

Earlier, I found that <S_z> = ħ cos( gamma B t )

Wait, no, that can't be right because the maximum value of S_z is ħ/2. So, if <S_z> is oscillating between something larger than ħ/2, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, right. Let me go back.

Wait, earlier, I had <S_z> = ħ cos(2 theta ), and theta is (gamma B t)/2. So 2 theta is gamma B t.

But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake when computing the expectation value.

Let me redo the calculation.

The state is |psi(t)> = sqrt(2) [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z> ], where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

The expectation value of S_z is:

< S_z > = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [ sin(theta) ]^2 (- ħ/2 )

Because |a|^2 is cos^2(theta), and |b|^2 is sin^2(theta) for the coefficient i sin(theta) (since |i|^2 is 1).

So,

< S_z > = ( cos^2(theta) ) (ħ/2 ) + ( sin^2(theta) ) ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos( 2 theta )

Because cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

Theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

< S_z > = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The average of mu_z is gamma times the average of S_z.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So, the average mu_z oscillates with amplitude (gamma ħ/2 ) and frequency gamma B.

But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. So the frequency is gamma B.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is gamma*B.

So the correct answer should be B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$, say $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is turned off and reactivated along $+Y$, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are superpositions of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:  
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
   \]
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i\omega_+ t} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\omega_- t} |-y\rangle \right),
   \]
   where $\omega_\pm = \pm \gamma B / 2$ are the energy eigenfrequencies.

3. **Expectation Value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   The magnetic moment $\mu_z$ is proportional to $S_z$, so $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting the time-evolved state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, it is found that:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ arises from the $\cos(\gamma B t)$ term, which has a frequency of $\gamma B$. This matches the Larmor frequency for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
