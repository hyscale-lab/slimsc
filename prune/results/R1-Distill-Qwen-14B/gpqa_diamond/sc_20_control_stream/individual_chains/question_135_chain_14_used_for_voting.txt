Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I remember bosons are force carriers, like photons or W and Z bosons. The question gives me a Lagrangian term and some info about the mass of the boson X. I need to find out what particles X can decay into, right?

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ψ_f(y))(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. The general form of Yukawa interactions is something like λ φ ψ ψ, where φ is a scalar field (boson) and ψ are fermions. So here, X is the boson field interacting with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the energy released has to be enough to create the decay products. The rest mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the lightest possible fermion pair it can decay into.

Wait, but what fermions are in the interaction? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, so which fermions are they? The problem says "fermions" in general, but maybe it's about the standard model fermions. Oh, and the term is f f(y), but maybe that's part of the field notation. Not sure, perhaps the fermions are quarks and leptons.

In the Standard Model, fermions have different masses. Let me think about the masses of the known particles. The top quark is really heavy, about 173 GeV. But the X here is only 6 GeV. So decay products can't have any fermion with a mass higher than 3 GeV, because twice that would be 6 GeV.

Wait, that's not exactly right. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV because each is half of 6.

Wait no, because when a particle at rest decays, the total energy of the decay products is the mass of the parent. So for a boson X with mass M, the decay products must have a combined mass less than M. But since fermions are being created as a pair (like f and f-bar), the sum would be 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of each fermion. So 2m_f ≤ M.

So for each fermion, m_f ≤ M/2 = 3 GeV.

So let's list the possible fermions:

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Leptons: electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos.

Wait, but the interaction is with ψ_f. Are the fermions in the Lagrangian charged fermions? Because the Yukawa term usually involves charged fermions. If X is neutral, then it can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermions are charged. Or maybe it's neutral, so the fermions must carry charge, but the X is neutral, so the decay products must be a pair that can annihilate or create.

Wait, but the exact details of the interaction aren't necessary for this problem. The main point is kinematic limits.

So the fermions that X can decay into must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each.

Let me think about the masses:

Up quark: around 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV)
Down quark: around 4-5 MeV (0.004-0.005 GeV)
Strange quark: around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV
Bottom quark: around 4.5 GeV
Top quark: 173 GeV.

So for X's mass of 6 GeV, 2m_f ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

Charm quark is 1.5 GeV → okay.

But bottom is 4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → so no, can't decay into b quarks. So X can't decay into b b-bar because each would require 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV.

Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy.

So possible quarks are u, d, s, c. Because their masses are each less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but what about their rest masses? Let me think. Up and down are very light, so their rest masses are much below 3 GeV. So when X decays into u and anti-u, that's possible. Same for d, s, c.

But wait, can the decay into a pair of up quarks? I mean, is 2m_u ≤6 GeV? Yes, because m_u is about 2 MeV, so 0.004 GeV, 2 times that is 0.008 GeV, which is much less than 6.

Same for all the others.

So for quarks, possible decay channels are uū, dī, sī, cī.

Now, what about leptons? Let's look at their masses.

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Neutrinos are almost massless, but probably negligible.

So, for leptons, each lepton must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, which is true for all except tau. Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. Wait, but 1.78 GeV is less than 3 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait no, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV? No, 3.56 is less than 6. Because 3.56 is about 3.5, which is less than 6. Oh wait, wait, the total mass of the pair must be less than or equal to X's mass, which is 6 GeV.

So 2m_tau = 2*1.78 ≈3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6, so tau pairs are allowed.

But wait, what about muon pairs? Muon mass is ~0.105 GeV. 2*0.105 is 0.21 GeV, which is way below 6. So that's allowed.

Same for electrons: 2*0.0005 is negligible, so allowed.

So for leptons, possible decay channels are e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but what about neutrinos? The problem's Lagrangian includes ψ_f. Neutrinos are leptons too, but in the Standard Model, they are neutral. So can X decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs?

Wait, the X field is a boson. If X is neutral, then maybe it can decay into neutrinos. But neutrinos have very tiny masses, so 2m_nu is negligible. So that would be possible, but the options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps it's not considered here.

Wait, the options only include charged lepton pairs. So looking at the options, option A includes b, which is too heavy, so A is out. Option B includes c, but wait, in option B, the decay includes c and others.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-
But b is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9>6, so X can't decay into b b̄. So option A is not possible because it includes b, which is too heavy.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-
c has mass ~1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6. So yes, c is allowed. So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-
t is 173 GeV, which is way too heavy. So option C includes t, which is impossible. So C is out.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-
Again, b is too heavy, so D is out.

So the only possible option is B, which includes c, but not b or t. So which options are correct?

Wait, but the interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the fermions in the interaction are only certain types?

Wait, perhaps the fermions ψ_f are only charged leptons or only quarks? Hmm, but the problem gives the Lagrangian as involving ψ_f, which could be any fermion. So the interaction is with all fermions that are included in the term. But the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions," so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pairs that are allowed kinematically.

But the options don't include any neutrino pairs, so perhaps the question is only considering charged fermions. Or perhaps the interactions are only with charged fermions, but that's not directly indicated.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is written as \bar{ψ} X ψ. So that would imply that ψ is a Dirac fermion. So both quarks and charged leptons are Dirac fermions, while neutrinos are also Dirac or Majorana. But in the SM, neutrinos are usually taken as left-handed, but I'm not sure about their mass terms.

But regardless, the problem's options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps the question is considering only charged fermions.

So back to the decays. For X to decay into a fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So possible fermions:

Charged quarks: u, d, s, c.

Charged leptons: e, μ, τ.

Now, for each of these, what is 2m?

u: ~0.004 GeV → 0.008 GeV. Sum is 0.008 GeV. So allowed.

d: ~0.005 GeV → sum 0.01 GeV.

s: ~0.1 GeV → sum 0.2 GeV.

c: ~1.5 GeV → sum 3 GeV.

e: ~0.001 GeV → sum ~0.002.

μ: ~0.105 GeV → sum ~0.21.

τ: ~1.78 GeV → sum ~3.56 GeV.

All of these are ≤6 GeV, so all allowed.

So possible decay channels include all the pairs of u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Wait, but the X is a boson. So it can decay into any of these pairs as long as their combined mass is ≤6 GeV.

So the possible decays are:

uū, dī, sī, cī, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

So looking at the options, option B lists X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term is of Yukawa type, indicating that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The key constraint is that the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 > 6 \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Neutrinos: Their masses are negligible, but they are not included in the options.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these decays are allowed, as their combined masses are \( \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Accepted**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**, which includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \).
