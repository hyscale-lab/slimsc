Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, each of the given compounds needs to be checked for such centers.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So the structure has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but in biphenyls, the arrangement around the single bond can lead to different isomers if there's a possibility of rotation preventing identical mirror images. Oh wait, but biphenyls can have atropisomers if the rings are substituted in a way that rotation is hindered. So if the substituents are in positions that make the two rings non-superimposable, then it's a case for stereoisomerism. So in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Hmm, 6 is opposite to 1, so maybe the arrangement leads to atropisomerism. So this compound can have optical isomers because it can have enantiomers due to the hindered rotation. So it would exhibit optical activity.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Structure: The acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH, but as an ester, it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no: Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (second carbon) has: CH2(OH), connected to CH2COOCH3? Let me see: The carbon with the OH would be connected to what? Let's see: the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. But as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH(OH) connected to two CH2 groups and the ester group. Wait, no, wait. Let me number the propanoate: first carbon is the COO- group, then the second is the OH, and third is CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. It's HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OMe. So it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, the second carbon is CH2(OH), connected to the first (CH2-) and third (CH2COO-) groups. Wait, maybe I should draw it:

Structure: 

O
||
OCH3
|
COOCH3
|
CH2-
|
CH(OH)-

Wait, I might be getting tangled up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon (second carbon) is CH(OH), connected to two CH2 groups and the COOCH3 group. Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate part is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second) is CH2(OH), connected to two CH2 groups and the ester group. Wait, no, the structure would be:

The ester is formed by the acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2(OH)—wait, no, that can't be right. Each carbon in the chain: first is COOCH3, second is CH2OH, third is CH2? Wait, no, wait: propanoate is three carbons. So the carbons are 1 (COOCH3), 2 (OH), 3 (CH3). Wait, no, 1 is COOCH3, 2 is CH2OH, and 3 is CH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2OH. Wait, that's a CH2 group, so the central carbon has two CH2 groups attached, which would be same. So the central carbon is CH2OH attached to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3 group. So that carbon has four substituents: two CH2 groups (same), COOCH3, and OH. Wait, but if two substituents are same (like two CH2 groups), then the central carbon can't be a chiral center because it's only attached to three different groups plus a same one. So in that case, the molecule wouldn't have a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents. Let me reevaluate. Let's imagine the structure: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2OH. Wait, no, it's the second carbon which is CH2OH. So the groups attached to the second carbon are: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups (from either side). Wait, but that can't be because the second carbon is CH2OH. Let me think: the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH2OH
Carbon 3: CH2-

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me number the chain: 1 (COOCH3), 2 (OH), 3 (CH3). So the structure would be:

O
||
OCH3
|
COOCH3
|
CH2OH
|
CH2CH3?

No, that can't be right. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as glycolic acid's ester. Wait, no, glycolic acid is 2-hydroxyacetic acid. Propanoate is three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2OH. So the groups attached to that carbon would be: two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons), an OH group, and a CH2COOCH3 group? No, wait, perhaps the central carbon is CH2OH, connected to the first carbon (CH2COOCH3) and the third carbon (CH2 something). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the substituents on the central carbon. The central carbon (second) is connected to:

- One OH group
- One CH2COOCH3 group (from the first carbon)
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, the third carbon is CH2. So perhaps the central carbon has:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups? But then, two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. So no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another angle: perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the propanoate ester is such that the hydroxyl is on a carbon that is connected to four different groups. For example, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the second carbon (the one with OH) is bonded to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- CH (from the third carbon?)

Wait, perhaps in that case, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- Two H's? No, wait, no, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and two H's? No, that can't be because each carbon in a chain must have four bonds. So in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the middle carbon (second) is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- Two H's? No, wait, no. That would imply it's CH2(OH). Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the presence of a chiral center. If the second carbon has four different substituents, then it's chiral. Let's see:

- CH3 (left side)
- COOCH3 (right side)
- OH (on the same carbon)
- And one more substituent, which would be a hydrogen? Wait, wait, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the second carbon is CH(OH). So it's connected to CH3 on one side, COOCH3 on the other, OH, and one hydrogen. So the four substituents would be: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different. So that carbon is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center, which means it can exhibit optical isomerism. Oh wait, so this changes my earlier conclusion. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center and hence can show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial thought. Let me confirm: in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (second) has:

- CH3 (from first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from third)
- OH
- H.

So four different substituents. So yes, that's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have optical isomers. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, does this compound have any chiral centers? Well, the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl group. The carbon in the ketone is sp2 hybridized, so it can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four substituents. Alternatively, does the molecule have any other chiral centers? Let's see: all the carbons are either in the benzene rings (which are symmetric) or the carbonyl. So the molecule is symmetrical around the central carbon. So no chiral centers. Hence, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester of fumaric acid with methanol. Structure: O
           ||
OCH3-C-CH2-COOCH3
           ||
           CH2?

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. But wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is actually HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H, but with the double bond between the two central carbons. When esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH3O)₂C-CH=CH-CO₂CH3? No, wait, dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester, so it's CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no. Let me think again: fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it trans. So the structure is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → but as fumaric acid, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So it's HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH but with a double bond → HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH → no, wait, actually, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond → no, wait, I think fumaric acid has the structure HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, no, that's not right. Wait, but fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is:

O
||
O
|
C=CH
|
O
O
||
O

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-(CH₂)-CH₂-C=O, but with the middle as a double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would be O=C-(CH₂)-CH₂-C=O, but each of the COOH groups esterified with methanol. Wait, no. Actually, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂CH₂-CO₂H, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's HO₂C-CH₂CH₂-CO₂H → but with a double bond, it's HO₂C-CH₂CH₂-CO₂H → No, no. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a trans double bond. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂: so HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified, it becomes (CH3O)₂C-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Wait, no, for dimethyl fumarate, each -COOH is esterified as -COOCH3. So the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, no, the structure would be CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂? No, because each -COOH is esterified. So the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but that's not possible because each CH₂ can only have two substituents. Wait, no. Let me think again: Fumaric acid is:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → but with a double bond, it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is:

O
||
O
|
C=CH
|
O
O
||
O

So the central two carbons are double-bonded, each attached to a COOH group. When esterified with methanol, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure becomes:

O
||
OCH3
|
C=CH
|
OCH3
O
||
OCH3

Wait, no. Each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So the two COOCH3 groups are on either end of the double bond. Now, considering stereoisomerism: since the double bond is in the middle, the groups on either side can be arranged in different ways. But wait, in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides (trans configuration) because it's the E isomer. So when esterified, the di-ester would retain that configuration. So dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Now, can this lead to stereoisomerism? Well, in the case of a double bond, if there are two different groups on each carbon, it can lead to cis and trans isomerism. But in this case, each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached? Wait no, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 from the other side? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The di-ester would be OCH3-O-C-OCH3 attached to each end. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-OCH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, perhaps each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? That can't be correct because each carbon of the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups, which would make it a symmetrical structure. Wait, no, because each CH in the double bond has two substituents. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as O=C-(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-OCH3, but with the double bond. Wait, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, let me think about the structure as dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. So the structure is:

O
||
OCH3
|
C=CH
|
OCH3
O
||
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)OCH3 but with a double bond between the two CH₂. So it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)OCH3 with a double bond. Wait, that's not making sense. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of whether dimethyl fumarate has any stereogenic elements.

In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure of fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, which has two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So when esterified, dimethyl fumarate will have two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this create a situation where the molecule can have stereoisomers?

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So on each double-bonded carbon, the substituents are COOCH3 and another COOCH3, along with the two CH3 groups? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbons of the double bond each have two identical substituents. Let me think: each double-bonded carbon in dimethyl fumarate is attached to a COOCH3 group and two CH3 groups. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has COOCH3 and another substituent. Wait, perhaps each is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? Hmm, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the possibility of cis and trans isomerism.

Wait, since the double bond is between two carbons each attached to two COOCH3 groups, would that allow for cis and trans isomerism? Wait, if both substituents on each carbon are the same, then there's no possibility for cis or trans. So if each carbon of the double bond has two identical substituents, like two COOCH3 groups, then any rotation around the double bond would not lead to different structures. But wait, in reality, each carbon in the double bond would have a COOCH3 group and another substituent, like a CH2 group or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the structure. Let me draw it:

The structure of fumaric acid is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups → so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, that's not right. Wait, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so it's HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → but with a double bond, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is:

O
||
O
|
C-CH=CH-C
|
O
O
||
O

Wait, but that's not correct. The correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So in the di-ester form (dimethyl fumarate), each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group (from CH₂). Wait, no, let me think: Each CH in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
OCH3
|
C=C
|
OCH3
O
||
OCH3

No, that's not correct because each C in the double bond would have two substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether the molecule can have geometric isomerism. If the molecule has a double bond with two different groups on each carbon, it can exhibit cis and trans isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. But in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each has two identical groups, making the molecule symmetric, so no geometric isomerism. Wait, but wait, if each C has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, then it's possible. No, because in dimethyl fumarate, each C of the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each C has two of the same substituent, meaning no possibility for cis or trans isomerism. But wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe each C has a COOCH3 and another substituent, like a CH2 group. If that's the case, then the double bond would have different groups on each C, leading to cis and trans isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

If each C in the double bond has a COOCH3 and another CH2 group, then each C has two different substituents. For example, each C has a COOCH3 and a CH2 connected to another group. If that's the case, then the double bond would have two different substituents on each C, allowing for cis and trans isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate would exhibit geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. Therefore, it can show optical isomerism because of the possibility of enantiomers arising from the arrangement around the double bond.

Wait, but wait. Optical isomerism is about whether the molecule can rotate plane-polarized light, which requires the presence of a chiral center or a non-superimposable mirror image. In the case of a double bond with geometric isomerism (cis and trans), the molecule can have enantiomers if the arrangement around the double bond leads to a chiral structure.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents on each C of the double bond are such that when you have the trans configuration, the molecule is chiral. Let me think: For a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. So in the case of the trans isomer of dimethyl fumarate, would it have a plane of symmetry? If both substituents on each C are same, then it's symmetrical. For example, if each C has two COOCH3 groups, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral. But if each C has different substituents, then the trans isomer may not be chiral either because it could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so the trans isomer is not chiral. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: in the case of fumaric acid (the diacid), it exists in the trans (E) configuration. The di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would have the same trans configuration. Now, does this trans configuration result in a chiral molecule? Because for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on each C of the double bond are same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are different, it might not have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each C of the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So the structure is symmetric, meaning that the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Thus, the molecule is not chiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate would not show optical activity.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are not the same. Let me think again: fumaric acid's structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is OCH3-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-C-OCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So each C in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each C has two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no chiral centers and no geometric isomerism leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me find another way. Another way to check for optical isomerism is to determine if the molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. If a compound has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, if it has a double bond with E/Z isomerism but no plane of symmetry, it can lead to enantiomers.

So for each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Atropisomerism is possible because the biphenyl rings can have substituents that prevent free rotation. So this compound can have enantiomers, hence optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: As discussed, the second carbon is a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers and symmetric structure, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: The structure is symmetric with each C of the double bond having two identical COOCH3 groups. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but earlier analysis of compound 4 led me to confusion. Let me recheck. If dimethyl fumarate has a structure where each C of the double bond has two identical substituents (like two COOCH3 groups), then the molecule would be symmetrical. So it's not chiral and cannot have optical isomerism. Therefore, compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.

So the correct compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. Wait, but wait, in dimethyl fumarate, I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: If the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, then each C of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So this would be a symmetrical molecule, hence not chiral. So no optical isomerism. But wait, another possibility: if the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3, which is not possible because each C can only have four bonds. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2(COOCH3))2C=C. No, that's not right. Hmm, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct conclusion is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism because it's symmetrical.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A) 1, 2 and 4 → if 4 doesn't show isomerism, this is wrong.

Option B) 3 and 4 → 3 doesn't, 4 maybe doesn't, so no.

Option C) 2 and 3 → 2 does, 3 doesn't, so incorrect.

Option D) 1 and 2 → both show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 may not show isomerism, but I'm not certain. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate's structure. Suppose the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each C in the double bond has a CH2 group and two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, that's not possible because each C can have only four bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but that would imply each C has two COOCH3 groups and two H's, making it symmetric. So in that case, the molecule is symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

Thus, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier thought about compound 4: some sources say that fumarate can form enantiomers. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong. Let me think: If the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, then each C in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So it's a symmetric molecule, so no. But if the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)(something else), then it might have stereoisomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look up dimethyl fumarate's structure. Alternatively, if I recall correctly, fumaric acid is an E-dioic acid, which upon esterification leads to a trans double bond. But in dimethyl fumarate, if the molecule is symmetric, perhaps it's not chiral. But if the substituents on each C are different, then it can be chiral.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans di-ester, and if each C has two identical substituents, then the molecule is not chiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, each C is attached to two COOCH3 groups, making it symmetrical, hence no optical isomerism.

So, the only compounds showing optical isomerism are 1 and 2, which corresponds to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a carbon atom (or another element) bonded to four distinct groups, or a lack of symmetry that prevents superimposing the molecule on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents create steric hindrance, preventing free rotation around the single bond. This results in atropisomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four distinct groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, H, and OH. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exist as enantiomers. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two benzene rings are connected by a ketone group. The central carbon is part of a planar carbonyl group and is not bonded to four distinct groups. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, and its di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, retains the trans (E) configuration. The structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical COOCH₃ groups, making the molecule symmetrical. Since there is a plane of symmetry, the molecule is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
