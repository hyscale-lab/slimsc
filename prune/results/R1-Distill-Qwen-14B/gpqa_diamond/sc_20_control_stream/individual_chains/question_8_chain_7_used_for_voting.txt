Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance genes and their interactions. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

So the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, and G3, and they're involved in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. The results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild type.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. The options involve things like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis. Hmm, right, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B can only be seen in the presence of a certain allele of A, or something like that.

Let me write down the data:

- Wild type resistance: 100%
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g2: 0%
- g1g3:10%
- g2g3:0%

I think the first thing to note is that when a single mutant is more susceptible than wild type, that gene might be contributing positively to resistance. So, if knocking out G2 causes 0% resistance, that suggests G2 is critical. Similarly, G3 knockout gives 50% resistance, G1 knockout gives 75% (so less resistance than wild type). 

Wait, but wait: 75% of control means that the mutant's resistance is 75% of the wild type's. So wild type is 100%, g1 is 75%, which is worse than wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, meaning G1 is contributing positively to resistance. Same for G3: 50% of control, so worse, so G3 is also contributing positively. G2 knockout is 0%—completely susceptible. So G2 is essential for resistance.

Now the double mutants: 

g1g2: 0%
g1g3:10%
g2g3:0%

Wait, so when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is 0%—same as g2 alone. For g1g3, it's 10%, which is even worse than g3 alone (50%). And g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

Hmm. So let me think about what this implies about the gene interactions.

We know that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. Since G2 knockout is completely susceptible, maybe G2 is a transcription factor. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable the pathway, leading to no resistance.

So the options suggest that G2 is often the transcription factor. Looking at the options, option A says G1 is the transcription factor, but that seems less likely because the g2 mutant is 0% resistance, which is more severe than g1, which is 75%. If G2 were just downstream, maybe knocking it out would disable the whole pathway. So G2 is probably the transcription factor.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have G2 as a transcription factor. So A is probably not correct.

Now, let's consider the double mutants.

Looking at g1g2: 0% which is same as g2 alone. So when both G1 and G2 are mutant, the phenotype is same as when G2 is mutant. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of a non-functional G2 is masking the effect of G1. So when G2 is non-functional, G1's effect doesn't matter—knocking out G1 in a G2- background doesn't change the resistance, it's still 0%. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So same reasoning: G2 is epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either of their single mutants (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining G1 and G3 knockouts leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and perhaps their functions are additive. Maybe they are in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. Or perhaps they work in the same pathway but are not redundant.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and knocking both out leads to a worse phenotype than each single mutant, that could mean they are part of a redundant system. Like, if they are part of the same pathway, and each contributes a bit, then knocking both out would make it much worse. Alternatively, if they are in separate pathways, but both contribute to the same overall process, knocking both out would compound the effect.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single. So the double mutant would be worse than both. For example, if G1 and G3 are two components of the same system that can work in parallel, then losing both would be worse than losing either one.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That could fit because their double mutant is worse than either single. But what else?

Another point: looking at the options, some mention pleiotropy, which refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So, the key points are:

1. G2 is a transcription factor (as per the options B, C, D).

2. G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the double mutants with G1 or G3 don't show worse phenotypes than g2 alone. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

3. G1 and G3's double mutant is worse than either single, suggesting perhaps they are in the same pathway, or their functions are additive or redundant.

Looking at the options:

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter doesn't seem to fit. Also, if G3 were epistatic to G1, then the g1g3 double would not be worse than g3 alone. Wait, in reality, the g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G3 were epistatic to G1, then g1g3 would be same as g3. But here it's worse, so that can't be. So option B is probably incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy here would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but I'm not sure. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 double, the phenotype would be same as G1 mutant. But g1 is 75% and g1g3 is 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit. So option C is probably wrong.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. Gene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either alone. That matches the data (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, double is 10%). So that's good.

Now, about the epistasis part. The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype is worse than either, which suggests that both contribute positively. So if G1 were epistatic over G3, perhaps in a pathway where G1 is upstream. So knocking out both would have an additive effect, but the double would still be worse. I'm a bit confused about how the epistatic relationships work here.

Wait, epistasis is about the relationship between two genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in A determines whether B's phenotype is expressed.

In the case of G1 and G3, since both contribute to resistance, perhaps they are in a linear pathway. Suppose G1 is upstream of G3. Then, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function because it's downstream. Wait, but in this case, the G1 mutant has 75% resistance, which is better than G3's 50%, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps both are in the same pathway, but their products contribute to the same function. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype, which would be the case for gene redundancy.

Wait, what's the difference between pleiotropy and gene redundancy? Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, such that knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype.

So looking back at the options:

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either. That fits with the data.

And the epistatic part: the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But how does that fit?

In the double mutants, when G2 is present, the G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So if G1 is upstream, then in the absence of G2 (which is a TF), the pathway is blocked. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as we saw earlier.

Wait, but the options for D state G1 is epistatic over G3. So in the double mutants, the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in our data, the g1g3 double is worse than either. So if G1 were epistatic to G3, then the double mutant should have the same as the more severe of the two. Since G1 is 75% and G3 is 50% (worse), if G1 is epistatic, then the double would be 50% (like G3). But in reality, it's 10%, which is worse. So that contradicts.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Epistasis is about the order in the pathway. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, it means that Gene A acts downstream of B. So if A is nonfunctional, then the pathway stops at A, regardless of B. So the phenotype would be the same as a knockout of A, even if B is also knocked out.

In our case, the double mutants involving G2 are all 0%, same as G2 single. So G2 must be downstream of G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G1 and G3.

So G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But what about the interaction between G1 and G3? Since their double mutant is worse than either, they're probably in the same pathway. So knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than knocking one out. This suggests that each contributes some function that can compensate for the other. So they might be redundant.

So in the case where G1 and G3 are redundant, each can perform the other's function. So knocking out one means the other can take over, but knocking both out means no function—so worse phenotype.

So G1 and G3 are redundant. That fits with option D, which says gene redundancy.

Now, the question is the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3. If they are redundant, then each can mask the effect of the other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. So the epistatic relationship isn't the same as a linear pathway.

Wait, but the option D states that G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be determined by G1. But in reality, the double is worse than either, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look back at the options.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, what does that mean for the double mutant? Let's think about it.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a functional G1 will mask the effect of G3. So in the double mutant (both knocked out), the phenotype would be the same as G1 mutant. But in the data, the double mutant (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that doesn't fit. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of G3 would determine the phenotype. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G3. But g3 is 50%, and the double is 10%. So no, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the double is worse than either suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to the same process. So each contributes part of the function. So without both, the function is severely compromised.

So perhaps they are not in a linear pathway, but in parallel. In such a case, each contributes a part of the resistance, and knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

But how does that affect epistasis? If they're in parallel, neither is epistatic to the other, because their functions are independent. So the double mutant would be additive.

But the options don't mention that. So perhaps the correct option is D, where G1 and G3 are redundant, despite the epistatic part not fitting.

Wait, another angle: when you have gene redundancy, the loss of either gene doesn't cause a problem because the other can compensate. So the single mutants have a mild phenotype, and the double mutant is much worse.

In our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and the double is 10%. So the double is worse than either, which is consistent with redundancy.

So option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That makes sense. Now, which gene is epistatic to the other.

Wait, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but in this scenario, since they are redundant, perhaps their order doesn't matter. Because whether you have one or the other, either can take over. So maybe it's not the right way to describe their relationship. Maybe option D is incorrect in that part.

But looking at the other options, let's check option A. It says G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but G2's single mutant is 0%, which is the worst. So G2 is epistatic to G1 because when G2 is knocked out, the double mutant with G1 doesn't change the phenotype. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

But option A says G1 is the TF. But that can't be, because the G2 knockout is worse, so G2 is more critical. So unless G1 is upstream of G2, which would mean G2 is downstream, making G2 epistatic to G1. So that makes sense.

Wait, if G1 is a TF upstream of G2, which is also a TF, but then G2 is more critical. But in the data, G1 is not as severe as G2. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial statement says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So if G2 is the TF, which makes sense because its knockout is the most severe, then G2 is acting upstream of other genes.

So in the option D, G2 is the TF. That aligns with the data.

So in option D, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's presence doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as g1. But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is A. Let me check.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but G2 as a single mutant is 0%, so if G2 is epistatic to G1, that makes sense. Because in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2's effect is masking G1's.

But if G1 is a TF, why is the G1 single mutant (75%) not more severe than the wild type? Because a TF usually activates downstream genes. If G1 is a TF and knocked out, then downstream genes (like maybe G2?) would not be expressed. But that's not what the data shows because g2 is 0%, g1 is 75%.

Wait, that would suggest that G1 is upstream of G2. Because if G1 is a TF for G2, then knocking out G1 would reduce G2's expression, leading to less resistance. But the data for g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0%. That's confusing.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if G1 is a TF for G2, then g1 would have lower G2 levels, so g1 would be more susceptible than wild type, which it is (75% vs 100%). But if G2 is also a TF, then g1 would be as bad as or worse than g2. But in reality, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So this suggests that G2 is downstream of G1.

Hmm, so if G1 is a TF for G2, then knocking out G1 would reduce G2's function, but perhaps G2 has other inputs or is partially active. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for other genes, and G1 is a TF for G2. So without G1, G2 isn't properly expressed, making the resistance worse. But in the data, g1's resistance is 75%, which is worse than wild type but better than g2's 0%. So perhaps G2 is more critical.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to reconstruct the possible pathway.

Assuming G2 is a transcription factor, which is necessary for the resistance pathway. So G2 activates other genes, perhaps G1 and G3.

If G2 is the main TF, then without G2, nothing downstream can be activated, leading to 0% resistance.

G1 and G3 could be downstream targets of G2. So if G2 is active, it induces G1 and G3, which together contribute to resistance.

In the single mutants:

- g2: 0% (no G2, so no downstream genes activated)
- g1: 75% (G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, contributing 75% resistance)
- g3:50% (G2 is active, G1 is expressed, contributing 50%)
- g1g3: 10% (both downstream genes knocked out; perhaps some residual function remains, but not much)

In this scenario, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in parallel pathways that additively contribute to resistance.

So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the residual resistance is very low (10%), worse than either alone.

In this model, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because its knockout masks their effects. So any double mutant involving G2 would have 0% resistance.

Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, which is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype, indicating redundancy or additive function.

Now, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but in the data, G1's single mutant is 75%, G3's is 50%, and their double is 10%. So they are in the same pathway, but redundant. So their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype than either. So the option says gene redundancy, which fits.

But the epistatic part: the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in reality, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't align with G1 being epistatic, as that would predict the double to be same as the more severe single. So perhaps the option is wrong, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A. Let me look.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But according to our analysis, G2 is the TF, not G1. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter doesn't fit. Also, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would be same as g3, which is 50%. But the data shows 10%, so that's not right.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, if G1 is epistatic, the double would be same as G1, which is 75%. But data shows 10%.

Hmm, perhaps the options don't perfectly fit, but the best fit is D.

Wait, another thought: gene redundancy implies that the two genes can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would be worse than either. That's the case here (10% vs 75% and 50%). So gene redundancy fits.

The epistatic part: in the pathway, if G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same downstream pathway, then perhaps the pathway is:

G2 activates both G1 and G3, which both contribute to resistance.

In this case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because their functions are downstream. So any double mutant with G2 will have no resistance.

Between G1 and G3, their roles are additive. So their combined knockout is worse than either.

But the options don't mention additive; they mention redundancy or other terms.

So among the options, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That's the closest fit.

The epistatic part in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in reality, since they are redundant, neither is epistatic. But perhaps the option is trying to convey that G1 is upstream or more important, but that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: epistatic relationships. G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the other mutations don't change the phenotype.

Now, the double mutants without G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) all have 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both.

Regarding G1 and G3, their double mutant is worse than either, implying that they function in the same pathway and their effects are additive. So they're in the same pathway, supporting each other.

So, their interaction isn't one of redundancy; rather, they each contribute to the same process.

So perhaps the interaction is additive, meaning their combined loss is worse than either. So they are in the same pathway but not redundant.

Looking back at the options, none of them mention additive, but option D says gene redundancy, which is a form of additive.

So considering all this, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are either redundant or additive, leading to a more severe phenotype when both are knocked out.

The only option that says G2 is TF is B, C, D. Among these, D says G1 and G3 are redundant. So it's the best fit.

Therefore, the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The experiment investigates the roles of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild type (100% resistance). The key findings are:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild type).  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (worse than wild type).  

   This indicates that all three genes contribute positively to resistance, with G2 being the most critical.

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  

   The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have the same resistance as g2, indicating that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute additively or redundantly to resistance.

### Analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.  
  This is inconsistent with the data because G2 is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), strongly suggesting that G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Additionally, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which does not align with pleiotropy.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1.  
  While G2 being the transcription factor aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Furthermore, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, contradicting the idea that G3 is epistatic to G1.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  The claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data. If G1 were epistatic to G3, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant (g3: 50%). However, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out this option.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  This option aligns with the data in two ways:  
  - G2 is the transcription factor, as it is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2).  
  - The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, consistent with gene redundancy, where G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance.  

  However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data. If G1 were epistatic to G3, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant (g3: 50%). Since the double mutant is worse than either single mutant, neither gene is epistatic to the other. Despite this inconsistency, this option is the best fit overall.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute redundantly to resistance. While the claim about G1 being epistatic to G3 is not fully consistent with the data, this option is the most accurate overall. 

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance genes and their interactions. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

So the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, and G3, and they're involved in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. The results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild type.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. The options involve things like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis. Hmm, right, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B can only be seen in the presence of a certain allele of A, or something like that.

Let me write down the data:

- Wild type resistance: 100%
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g2: 0%
- g1g3:10%
- g2g3:0%

I think the first thing to note is that when a single mutant is more susceptible than wild type, that gene might be contributing positively to resistance. So, if knocking out G2 causes 0% resistance, that suggests G2 is critical. Similarly, G3 knockout gives 50% resistance, G1 knockout gives 75% (so less resistance than wild type). 

Wait, but wait: 75% of control means that the mutant's resistance is 75% of the wild type's. So wild type is 100%, g1 is 75%, which is worse than wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, meaning G1 is contributing positively to resistance. Same for G3: 50% of control, so worse, so G3 is also contributing positively. G2 knockout is 0%—completely susceptible. So G2 is essential for resistance.

Now the double mutants: 

g1g2: 0%
g1g3:10%
g2g3:0%

Wait, so when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is 0%—same as g2 alone. For g1g3, it's 10%, which is even worse than g3 alone (50%). And g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

Hmm. So let me think about what this implies about the gene interactions.

We know that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. Since G2 knockout is completely susceptible, maybe G2 is a transcription factor. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable the pathway, leading to no resistance.

So the options suggest that G2 is often the transcription factor. Looking at the options, option A says G1 is the transcription factor, but that seems less likely because the g2 mutant is 0% resistance, which is more severe than g1, which is 75%. If G2 were just downstream, maybe knocking it out would disable the whole pathway. So G2 is probably the transcription factor.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have G2 as a transcription factor. So A is probably not correct.

Now, let's consider the double mutants.

Looking at g1g2: 0% which is same as g2 alone. So when both G1 and G2 are mutant, the phenotype is same as when G2 is mutant. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of a non-functional G2 is masking the effect of G1. So when G2 is non-functional, G1's effect doesn't matter—knocking out G1 in a G2- background doesn't change the resistance, it's still 0%. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So same reasoning: G2 is epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either of their single mutants (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So combining G1 and G3 knockouts leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and perhaps their functions are additive. Maybe they are in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. Or perhaps they work in the same pathway but are not redundant.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and knocking both out leads to a worse phenotype than each single mutant, that could mean they are part of a redundant system. Like, if they are part of the same pathway, and each contributes a bit, then knocking both out would make it much worse. Alternatively, if they are in separate pathways, but both contribute to the same overall process, knocking both out would compound the effect.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single. So the double mutant would be worse than both. For example, if G1 and G3 are two components of the same system that can work in parallel, then losing both would be worse than losing either one.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That could fit because their double mutant is worse than either single. But what else?

Another point: looking at the options, some mention pleiotropy, which refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So, the key points are:

1. G2 is a transcription factor (as per the options B, C, D).

2. G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the double mutants with G1 or G3 don't show worse phenotypes than g2 alone. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

3. G1 and G3's double mutant is worse than either single, suggesting perhaps they are in the same pathway, or their functions are additive or redundant.

Looking at the options:

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter doesn't seem to fit. Also, if G3 were epistatic to G1, then the g1g3 double would not be worse than g3 alone. Wait, in reality, the g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G3 were epistatic to G1, then g1g3 would be same as g3. But here it's worse, so that can't be. So option B is probably incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy here would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but I'm not sure. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 double, the phenotype would be same as G1 mutant. But g1 is 75% and g1g3 is 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit. So option C is probably wrong.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. Gene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either alone. That matches the data (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, double is 10%). So that's good.

Now, about the epistasis part. The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype is worse than either, which suggests that both contribute positively. So if G1 were epistatic over G3, perhaps in a pathway where G1 is upstream. So knocking out both would have an additive effect, but the double would still be worse. I'm a bit confused about how the epistatic relationships work here.

Wait, epistasis is about the relationship between two genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in A determines whether B's phenotype is expressed.

In the case of G1 and G3, since both contribute to resistance, perhaps they are in a linear pathway. Suppose G1 is upstream of G3. Then, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function because it's downstream. Wait, but in this case, the G1 mutant has 75% resistance, which is better than G3's 50%, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps both are in the same pathway, but their products contribute to the same function. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype, which would be the case for gene redundancy.

Wait, what's the difference between pleiotropy and gene redundancy? Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, such that knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype.

So looking back at the options:

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either. That fits with the data.

And the epistatic part: the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But how does that fit?

In the double mutants, when G2 is present, the G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So if G1 is upstream, then in the absence of G2 (which is a TF), the pathway is blocked. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as we saw earlier.

Wait, but the options for D state G1 is epistatic over G3. So in the double mutants, the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in our data, the g1g3 double is worse than either. So if G1 were epistatic to G3, then the double mutant should have the same as the more severe of the two. Since G1 is 75% and G3 is 50% (worse), if G1 is epistatic, then the double would be 50% (like G3). But in reality, it's 10%, which is worse. So that contradicts.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Epistasis is about the order in the pathway. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, it means that Gene A acts downstream of B. So if A is nonfunctional, then the pathway stops at A, regardless of B. So the phenotype would be the same as a knockout of A, even if B is also knocked out.

In our case, the double mutants involving G2 are all 0%, same as G2 single. So G2 must be downstream of G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G1 and G3.

So G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But what about the interaction between G1 and G3? Since their double mutant is worse than either, they're probably in the same pathway. So knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than knocking one out. This suggests that each contributes some function that can compensate for the other. So they might be redundant.

So in the case where G1 and G3 are redundant, each can perform the other's function. So knocking out one means the other can take over, but knocking both out means no function—so worse phenotype.

So G1 and G3 are redundant. That fits with option D, which says gene redundancy.

Now, the question is the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3. If they are redundant, then each can mask the effect of the other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. So the epistatic relationship isn't the same as a linear pathway.

Wait, but the option D states that G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be determined by G1. But in reality, the double is worse than either, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look back at the options.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, what does that mean for the double mutant? Let's think about it.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a functional G1 will mask the effect of G3. So in the double mutant (both knocked out), the phenotype would be the same as G1 mutant. But in the data, the double mutant (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that doesn't fit. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of G3 would determine the phenotype. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G3. But g3 is 50%, and the double is 10%. So no, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the double is worse than either suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to the same process. So each contributes part of the function. So without both, the function is severely compromised.

So perhaps they are not in a linear pathway, but in parallel. In such a case, each contributes a part of the resistance, and knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

But how does that affect epistasis? If they're in parallel, neither is epistatic to the other, because their functions are independent. So the double mutant would be additive.

But the options don't mention that. So perhaps the correct option is D, where G1 and G3 are redundant, despite the epistatic part not fitting.

Wait, another angle: when you have gene redundancy, the loss of either gene doesn't cause a problem because the other can compensate. So the single mutants have a mild phenotype, and the double mutant is much worse.

In our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and the double is 10%. So the double is worse than either, which is consistent with redundancy.

So option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That makes sense. Now, which gene is epistatic to the other.

Wait, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but in this scenario, since they are redundant, perhaps their order doesn't matter. Because whether you have one or the other, either can take over. So maybe it's not the right way to describe their relationship. Maybe option D is incorrect in that part.

But looking at the other options, let's check option A. It says G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but G2's single mutant is 0%, which is the worst. So G2 is epistatic to G1 because when G2 is knocked out, the double mutant with G1 doesn't change the phenotype. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

But option A says G1 is the TF. But that can't be, because the G2 knockout is worse, so G2 is more critical. So unless G1 is upstream of G2, which would mean G2 is downstream, making G2 epistatic to G1. So that makes sense.

Wait, if G1 is a TF upstream of G2, which is also a TF, but then G2 is more critical. But in the data, G1 is not as severe as G2. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial statement says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So if G2 is the TF, which makes sense because its knockout is the most severe, then G2 is acting upstream of other genes.

So in the option D, G2 is the TF. That aligns with the data.

So in option D, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's presence doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as g1. But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is A. Let me check.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but G2 as a single mutant is 0%, so if G2 is epistatic to G1, that makes sense. Because in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2's effect is masking G1's.

But if G1 is a TF, why is the G1 single mutant (75%) not more severe than the wild type? Because a TF usually activates downstream genes. If G1 is a TF and knocked out, then downstream genes (like maybe G2?) would not be expressed. But that's not what the data shows because g2 is 0%, g1 is 75%.

Wait, that would suggest that G1 is upstream of G2. Because if G1 is a TF for G2, then knocking out G1 would reduce G2's expression, leading to less resistance. But the data for g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0%. That's confusing.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if G1 is a TF for G2, then g1 would have lower G2 levels, so g1 would be more susceptible than wild type, which it is (75% vs 100%). But if G2 is also a TF, then g1 would be as bad as or worse than g2. But in reality, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So this suggests that G2 is downstream of G1.

Hmm, so if G1 is a TF for G2, then knocking out G1 would reduce G2's function, but perhaps G2 has other inputs or is partially active. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for other genes, and G1 is a TF for G2. So without G1, G2 isn't properly expressed, making the resistance worse. But in the data, g1's resistance is 75%, which is worse than wild type but better than g2's 0%. So perhaps G2 is more critical.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to reconstruct the possible pathway.

Assuming G2 is a transcription factor, which is necessary for the resistance pathway. So G2 activates other genes, perhaps G1 and G3.

If G2 is the main TF, then without G2, nothing downstream can be activated, leading to 0% resistance.

G1 and G3 could be downstream targets of G2. So if G2 is active, it induces G1 and G3, which together contribute to resistance.

In the single mutants:

- g2: 0% (no G2, so no downstream genes activated)
- g1: 75% (G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, contributing 75% resistance)
- g3:50% (G2 is active, G1 is expressed, contributing 50%)
- g1g3: 10% (both downstream genes knocked out; perhaps some residual function remains, but not much)

In this scenario, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in parallel pathways that additively contribute to resistance.

So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the residual resistance is very low (10%), worse than either alone.

In this model, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because its knockout masks their effects. So any double mutant involving G2 would have 0% resistance.

Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, which is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype, indicating redundancy or additive function.

Now, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but in the data, G1's single mutant is 75%, G3's is 50%, and their double is 10%. So they are in the same pathway, but redundant. So their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype than either. So the option says gene redundancy, which fits.

But the epistatic part: the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in reality, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't align with G1 being epistatic, as that would predict the double to be same as the more severe single. So perhaps the option is wrong, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A. Let me look.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But according to our analysis, G2 is the TF, not G1. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter doesn't fit. Also, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would be same as g3, which is 50%. But the data shows 10%, so that's not right.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, if G1 is epistatic, the double would be same as G1, which is 75%. But data shows 10%.

Hmm, perhaps the options don't perfectly fit, but the best fit is D.

Wait, another thought: gene redundancy implies that the two genes can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would be worse than either. That's the case here (10% vs 75% and 50%). So gene redundancy fits.

The epistatic part: in the pathway, if G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same downstream pathway, then perhaps the pathway is:

G2 activates both G1 and G3, which both contribute to resistance.

In this case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because their functions are downstream. So any double mutant with G2 will have no resistance.

Between G1 and G3, their roles are additive. So their combined knockout is worse than either.

But the options don't mention additive; they mention redundancy or other terms.

So among the options, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That's the closest fit.

The epistatic part in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in reality, since they are redundant, neither is epistatic. But perhaps the option is trying to convey that G1 is upstream or more important, but that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: epistatic relationships. G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the other mutations don't change the phenotype.

Now, the double mutants without G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) all have 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both.

Regarding G1 and G3, their double mutant is worse than either, implying that they function in the same pathway and their effects are additive. So they're in the same pathway, supporting each other.

So, their interaction isn't one of redundancy; rather, they each contribute to the same process.

So perhaps the interaction is additive, meaning their combined loss is worse than either. So they are in the same pathway but not redundant.

Looking back at the options, none of them mention additive, but option D says gene redundancy, which is a form of additive.

So considering all this, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are either redundant or additive, leading to a more severe phenotype when both are knocked out.

The only option that says G2 is TF is B, C, D. Among these, D says G1 and G3 are redundant. So it's the best fit.

Therefore, the answer is D.


The experiment investigates the roles of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild type (100% resistance). The key findings are:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (worse than wild type).  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (worse than wild type).  

   This indicates that all three genes contribute positively to resistance, with G2 being the most critical.

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  

   The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have the same resistance as g2, indicating that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute additively or redundantly to resistance.

### Analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.  
  This is inconsistent with the data because G2 is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2), strongly suggesting that G2, not G1, is the transcription factor. Additionally, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which does not align with pleiotropy.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1.  
  While G2 being the transcription factor aligns with the data, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Furthermore, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, contradicting the idea that G3 is epistatic to G1.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  The claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data. If G1 were epistatic to G3, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant (g3: 50%). However, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out this option.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.  
  This option aligns with the data in two ways:  
  - G2 is the transcription factor, as it is the most critical gene (0% resistance in g2).  
  - The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, consistent with gene redundancy, where G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance.  

  However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data. If G1 were epistatic to G3, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant (g3: 50%). Since the double mutant is worse than either single mutant, neither gene is epistatic to the other. Despite this inconsistency, this option is the best fit overall.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute redundantly to resistance. While the claim about G1 being epistatic to G3 is not fully consistent with the data, this option is the most accurate overall. 

ANSWER: D
