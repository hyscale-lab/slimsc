Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about the probability of a single atom decaying after some time has passed. Hmm.

Alright, the setup: We have an atom that's supposed to decay with a certain probability. The problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So, the initial probability is 32% over 100 minutes. So the probability it decays in 100 minutes is 0.32. But wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in radioactive decay, the probability is usually modeled with an exponential decay function. So maybe I should think in terms of the decay constant.

I remember that the decay probability (or the fraction that decays) over time t is given by 1 minus e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Or wait, no, that's the fraction that has decayed by time t. So the survival probability is e^(-λt), and the probability of decaying by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

But wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's 32% chance that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. So, 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So we can solve for λ.

Let me write that down: 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. So e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. Therefore, λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68), wait, what's that? Let me think. ln(1)=0. ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. Oh wait, 0.68 is close to 0.7, so ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667. Let me get more precise. Let me compute it: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So the decay constant λ is about 0.0038566 min^-1.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but does that mean the next 150 minutes after the initial time, or the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes? Because the way the question is phrased says, "so far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed." So the time elapsed is 50 minutes. So the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start. But wait, no, the next 150 minutes is from the current time, which is 50 minutes in. So the time from now is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

Wait, but no, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So that's the period from time t=50 to t=200. So we need the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200.

But wait, in radioactive decay, the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So if the decay hasn't happened in 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval.

Wait, that's right. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150). Because the memoryless property says that the remaining lifetime is the same as a new atom. So the fact that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes doesn't change the probability of decaying in the next 150.

So, wait, but the initial 100 minutes gives a 32% chance. So perhaps another approach is to compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes, considering that 50 minutes have already gone by without decay.

Alternatively, I can compute the total time as 200 minutes. Let's see. The probability that the atom decays by 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 200). But wait, the probability that it decays after 50 minutes but before 200 minutes is equal to the probability it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability it decayed by 50 minutes. So that's [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Wait, but wait, the question says, after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed. So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [probability it decays between 50 and 200] divided by the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes.

Wait, no. Because in conditional probability, the probability is P(A|B) where A is the event that it decays in the next 150 minutes, and B is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since B implies that the atom hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, and A is a subset of that (since if it decays after 50, then B is true). So P(A and B) is just P(A given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is equal to the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it hasn't decayed by 50. Because the memoryless property, this is just the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting fresh. So, P(decays in 150 minutes) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, no. Because the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from now. So it's the same as the general probability of decaying in a time T, regardless of when you start. So, the answer would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, in the initial condition, we know that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So let's compute λ using that.

We have 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = (ln(1.4698)) /100. Wait, no, wait: ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.47). Let me compute ln(0.68) again. Oh wait, earlier I thought ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 /100 ≈ 0.0038566 min^-1.

So, the value of λ is approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the next step is to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So that's a time period of 150 minutes.

So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Plugging in λ:

1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150)

Compute 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's calculate 0.57849.

Using a calculator approach:

The natural exponent function:

We can approximate e^-0.57849.

Let me compute 0.57849:

It's between 0.57 and 0.58.

e^-0.57 ≈ 0.565; e^-0.58 ≈ 0.560. Let me think of a better way.

Alternatively, using the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0.5:

But maybe it's easier to compute ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, so e^-0.5798 ≈ 0.56. So 0.57849 is very close to that. So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56.

Wait, but more accurately, let's think:

We know that:

ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798.

So, x = 0.57849 is a bit less than 0.5798. So e^-x = e^(0.5798 - 0.0013) ≈ e^0.5798 * e^-0.0013.

e^0.5798 ≈ 1/(e^(-0.5798)) = 1/0.56 ≈ 1.7857.

Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me use a calculator-like approximation.

Alternatively, let's compute e^-0.57849:

We can write 0.57849 as approximately 0.579 - 0.00051.

So, e^-0.579 * e^0.00051.

e^0.00051 ≈ 1 + 0.00051 = 1.00051.

e^-0.579 ≈ 0.56 (since ln(0.56)= -0.5798, which I mentioned earlier). So 0.56 * 1.00051 ≈ 0.56028.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because e^-x is the same as 1/(e^x). So, if e^-0.579 ≈ 0.56, then e^(0.579) ≈ 1/0.56 ≈ 1.7857.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator. But since I can't, I'll proceed with an approximation.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, or 44%. So the probability is about 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute λ again.

Earlier, we had 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ)=0.68.

So λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 → ln(1.47) is approximately 0.38566. So λ is 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, for 150 minutes: λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ ?

Wait, let's compute e^-0.57849 using a better approximation.

We can write this as:

We know that e^-0.57849 = 1 / e^{0.57849}.

We can compute e^0.57849.

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211.

0.57849 is 0.5 + 0.07849.

So e^0.57849 = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849^2)/2 + (0.07849^3)/6.

Compute each term:

0.07849^2 ≈ 0.00616.

0.07849^3 ≈ 0.000483.

So:

1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849

plus 0.00616/2 = 0.00308 → 1.08157

plus 0.000483/6 ≈ 0.0000805 → 1.08165.

So e^0.07849 ≈ approximately 1.08165.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08 ≈ Let's compute that.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

Adding them gives approximately 1.7806.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.7806.

Therefore, e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.7806 ≈ 0.5608.

So 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, approximately 43.92%, which is about 44%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%, which corresponds to option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability of an atom over time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(\text{decay in } t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(\text{decay in 100 minutes}) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32 \implies e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). Thus, the probability is:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations, \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56 \). Therefore:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) 44%**

Now, the next step is to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So that's a time period of 150 minutes.

So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Plugging in λ:

1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150)

Compute 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

Wait, but more accurately, let's think:

We know that:

ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798.

So, x = 0.57849 is a bit less than 0.5798. So e^-x = e^(0.5798 - 0.0013) ≈ e^0.5798 * e^-0.0013.

e^0.5798 ≈ 1/(e^(-0.5798)) = 1/0.56 ≈ 1.7857.

Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me use a calculator-like approximation.

Alternatively, let's compute e^-0.57849:

We can write 0.57849 as approximately 0.579 - 0.00051.

So, e^-0.579 * e^0.00051.

e^0.00051 ≈ 1 + 0.00051 = 1.00051.

e^-0.579 ≈ 0.56 (since ln(0.56)= -0.5798, which I mentioned earlier). So 0.56 * 1.00051 ≈ 0.56028.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because e^-x is the same as 1/(e^x). So, if e^-0.579 ≈ 0.56, then e^(0.579) ≈ 1/0.56 ≈ 1.7857.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator. But since I can't, I'll proceed with an approximation.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, or 44%. So the probability is about 44%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute λ again.

Earlier, we had 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ)=0.68.

So λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 → ln(1.47) is approximately 0.38566. So λ is 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, for 150 minutes: λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ ?

Wait, let's compute e^-0.57849 using a better approximation.

We can write this as:

We know that e^-0.57849 = 1 / e^{0.57849}.

We can compute e^0.57849.

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211.

0.57849 is 0.5 + 0.07849.

So e^0.57849 = e^0.5 * e^0.07849.

e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849^2)/2 + (0.07849^3)/6.

Compute each term:

0.07849^2 ≈ 0.00616.

0.07849^3 ≈ 0.000483.

So:

1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849

plus 0.00616/2 = 0.00308 → 1.08157

plus 0.000483/6 ≈ 0.0000805 → 1.08165.

So e^0.07849 ≈ approximately 1.08165.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08 ≈ Let's compute that.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

Adding them gives approximately 1.7806.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.7806.

Therefore, e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.7806 ≈ 0.5608.

So 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, approximately 43.92%, which is about 44%.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%, which corresponds to option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability of an atom over time \( t \) is given by:

\[

\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(\text{decay in 100 minutes}) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32 \implies e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). Thus, the probability is:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations, \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56 \). Therefore:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) 44%**
