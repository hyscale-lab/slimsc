Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants plays a crucial role in renormalizability.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ, which is the coefficient of this interaction term. 

First, I should figure out the mass dimensions of each field and term involved. Let's list what I know:

- The Dirac field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2. That's because the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has dimension 4. So the kinetic term for ψ is something like iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which gives each ψ a dimension of 3/2.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from electromagnetism, I think. Since F is the field tensor for a gauge field, like the photon, which has a mass dimension of 1. Because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, each A has dimension 1. So F should have dimension 2? Wait, no, wait. Because each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F, which is ∂A, has dimension 1+1=2.

Wait, but wait. The field strength tensor is part of the Lagrangian. The Maxwell term is F^2, which is dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless. So the term F_{μν} F^{μν} has dimension 4. Since F has dimension 2, squaring it gives 4. So that makes sense.

Now, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so σ itself must be dimensionless too.

Putting it all together: The Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. Then σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3. F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the entire term is κ multiplied by 3 (from ψ̄ σ ψ) times 2 (from F). Wait, no, wait: I think I need to multiply the dimensions of each component. Let me correct that.

The term is: (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ) multiplied by F^{μν}.

So the dimensions would be [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F^{μν}].

Wait, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F has dimension 2. So the product is 3 * 2 = 5. So the term [κ ψ̄ σ ψ F] has dimension [κ] + 5. 

But wait, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. Because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over spacetime, it must be dimensionless (since action is dimensionless, and the integral is over 4 dimensions, each with dimension 1). So the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

So the entire term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. So [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would make option A or C possible, as they have [κ]_M = -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability is determined by the mass dimension of the coupling constant. A theory is renormalizable if the coupling has a positive or zero mass dimension (i.e., [g]_M ≥ 0). Because then the interaction term can have a finite number of terms after considering possible divergences.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about the renormalizability condition. In terms of the power counting theorem: each interaction term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension ≤ 4 (for 4D theories) because terms with higher dimension would lead to nonrenormalizable interactions. Alternatively, the coupling's mass dimension must be ≥ 0 because the dimension of the term is [g] + sum of fields' dimensions. For the term to have dimension ≤4, [g] should be ≤4 - sum of fields' dimensions. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the general rule is that for a coupling term in the Lagrangian L ∼ g φ^n, the coupling g has dimension [g] = 4 - n [φ], where each φ has its own dimension. The theory is renormalizable if [g] ≥ 0. Because higher dimension couplings (negative) would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

In our case, the interaction term is L ∼ κ (ψψ)(F), which can be thought of as a coupling between two ψs and an F. So the term is O(κ ψψ F).

The dimension of each field:

ψ: 3/2.

F: 2.

So the sum of the fields in the term is (3/2)*2 (because two ψs) + 2 (from F) = 3 +2=5.

The term has dimension [κ] +5 =4 (as before). So κ has dimension -1.

So the coupling's dimension is [κ] = -1.

In terms of renormalizability, if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because the dimension is [g] < 0. Because for each interaction term, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0 to maintain renormalizability. So if [κ]=-1, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together, [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, option C is [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable, which would be correct.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$, as it arises from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has $[A_\mu]_M = 1$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have a total mass dimension of 4, as the Lagrangian density in 4D spacetime has $[\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$. Breaking down the dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Thus, the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a total dimension of:
\[
\left[\bar{\psi}\right]_M + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]_M + \left[\psi\right]_M + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian must have $[\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa]_M \geq 0$. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
