Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR characteristics: in the 1H NMR, there's a single peak at 7 ppm, and in the 13C NMR, two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, I remember that in anhydrides, the carbonyl groups (the O=C-O-C=O parts) will show up as specific signals. The 137 ppm peak is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe the carbonyl carbons. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact ranges. Oh wait, carbonyl carbons in anhydrides usually show up around 165-185 ppm. So the 165 ppm peak is likely one of the carbonyl carbons. Then the 137 ppm must be the bridgehead carbon, the one connecting the two oxygen atoms. Like, the structure where two carbonyls are connected by an oxygen bridge.

The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's probably the protons on the alkene because vinyl protons typically resonate around 5-7 ppm. But wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated to form the anhydride, the alkene becomes part of a six-membered ring? Or maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. Wait, because when a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-diepoxy structure (like cis-alkene) is dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring. Because the formation of an anhydride from a diacid typically involves losing water and connecting two carboxylic acid groups into a cyclic structure.

So the structure would be a five-membered cyclic anhydride, right? So the bridge is formed by the two carbonyl groups and an oxygen. The double bond in the original molecule becomes part of the ring. Wait, no, the double bond is in the diacid. So when dehydrated, perhaps the double bond is retained as a bridge. Or maybe the dehydration forms a ring, so the double bond is inside the ring and becomes part of a conjugated system.

Hmm, but the initial compound is a cis-alkene. So when the anhydride forms, the geometry of the ring will affect the structure.

But moving on. The anhydride is then reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, and it has four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentadiene ring. So the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1 and 3, and each of the carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. Wait, no: 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but wait, that's not possible because cyclopentadiene usually has conjugated double bonds. Oh wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene with a single bond between 2-3. But in the case of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So the structure is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons except maybe the fifth.

Wait, no, the molecule is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the cyclopentadiene is 1,3-diene (so double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4?), but wait, that's not possible in a five-membered ring because that would require four positions. Wait, maybe it's a 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring, meaning the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, but that would require the ring to have five members, with double bonds non-conjugated. Wait, but in reality, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. So the structure would be a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but that would mean the ring has four bonds, so maybe it's 1,2 and 3,4? No, that doesn't make a ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: a cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but that's impossible for a five-membered ring. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1,2 and 3,4, but that would leave the ring with two double bonds that aren't conjugated. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene, like 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring, which would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, but that would actually be a five-membered ring with four carbons involved in double bonds. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just think about the structure as a diene that's going to undergo a Diels-Alder reaction.

So the anhydride is a dienophile because when you have a dienophile like a cyclic anhydride, it can react with a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, so the dienophile is the anhydride, and the diene is the 1,3-cyclopentadiene derivative. So the reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a six-membered ring with the two new sigma bonds.

The products are two: major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The dienophile (the anhydride) has to contribute how many carbons? Let's see: the diene has 5 carbons (cyclopentadiene) plus four methyl groups, so 5 +4 =9 carbons? Wait, no, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So it's a cyclopentadiene (5-membered ring with two double bonds) with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So the structure would be:

Positions 1,2 have a methyl each, positions 3,4 have a methyl each, and position 5 is not substituted. So the diene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4? Or perhaps 1,3-diene? Maybe I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the exact structure isn't critical for the NMR part.

The Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The dienophile is the anhydride, which would contribute two carbons (the carbonyl groups) or maybe more. Wait, the anhydride is from a dicarboxylic acid. Let me think about the structure. If it's a cyclic anhydride formed from a cis-dicarboxylic acid, the structure is likely a five-membered ring: O-C-O linked to two carbonyl groups.

Wait, when a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene dehydrates, it forms a cyclic anhydride. So the structure would be a five-membered ring, with the two carbonyl groups (O=C-O-C=O) connected by an oxygen bridge. The oxygen is part of the ring. The two carbonyl carbons would be at 165 ppm and the adjacent carbons (like the bridgehead) would be around 137 ppm.

So the dienophile is this five-membered cyclic anhydride. When it reacts with the diene (the tetramethylcyclopentadiene), it forms a Diels-Alder adduct. But wait, a Diels-Alder typically forms a six-membered ring, but the dienophile is a five-membered ring. Hmm, maybe the dienophile is a substituted dienophile, like an anhydride with electron-withdrawing groups, making it a good dienophile.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) and the dienophile (the anhydride) combine to form a six-membered ring. The endo rule might say that the more substituted product is the major one, but I'm not sure.

The products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formulas. The dienophile (anhydride) would have a formula based on the dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid was something like HOOC-(CH2)m-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride, so the formula would be (if the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond) something like (O=C-O-C=O) connected in a ring. But perhaps the exact formula isn't necessary right now.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the formula is C9H12. The anhydride, which is derived from a dicarboxylic acid, likely has formula C4H2O3 (since each COOH is C2H4O2, and losing H2O when forming the anhydride would give C4H2O3). So when the dienophile (C4H2O3) reacts with the diene (C9H12), the product would be C13H14O3. Wait, but the product is C13H16O3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is larger. Let me think: the dienophile is the anhydride, which comes from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Let's say the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, so HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH would have four carbons. The anhydride would be O=C-O-C=O, but connected via the two middle carbons, perhaps. Wait, perhaps the acid has a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So when dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride with five members: O=C-O connected to two CH2 groups, but perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the molecular formula isn't the key point.

Moving on, both products have the same molecular formula, so the difference must be in the stereochemistry or the position of substituents. The major and minor products result from the Diels-Alder reaction, which can form two diastereomers, perhaps.

The question then talks about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak (indicating spatial proximity of protons) in its NOESY, while the minor doesn't. So, in the major product, two protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak. The minor product doesn't have this, meaning those protons are not near each other.

The question is asking which two resonances (protons) are connected by this cross-peak in the major product. The options are A to D, each pairing different types of protons.

Looking at the options:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 and 2H singlet at ~3.5.

So the cross-peak is between these two sets of protons.

Now, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state leads to the major product. The endo rule suggests that the more substituted (and thus more stable) product is formed. In the structure, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be positioned in a way that allows for maximum orbital overlap and perhaps some secondary orbital interactions.

In the adduct, the substituents from the dienophile would be on the same face of the six-membered ring. So, perhaps the protons from the diene that are on the same face would be near each other in the product.

Wait, but the NOESY cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are in close proximity in space. So perhaps in the major product, two protons that are on adjacent carbons but trans to each other are close, or maybe two protons that are on the same face are near.

Alternatively, think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The diene contributes four carbons (the cyclopentadiene has four carbons with methyl groups?), and the dienophile contributes two carbons from the anhydride. So the six-membered ring would have substituents from both.

Wait, perhaps the diene in the Diels-Alder is the 1,3-cyclopentadiene derivative, and the dienophile is the anhydride. So the adduct will have the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) and the substituents from the dienophile (the carbonyl groups).

In the product, the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the substituents from the diene.

Wait, but this might lead to specific spatial arrangements. For example, the methyl groups from the diene would be positioned in a certain way relative to the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

In the major product, perhaps some methyl groups are close to each other, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY. Conversely, the minor product may have a different arrangement where those protons are not near each other.

Looking at the options, option B is a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. A singlet for 6H suggests perhaps three equivalent methyl groups or maybe two equivalent groups each contributing three H. Wait, the diene has four methyl groups, so perhaps some are equivalent in the product.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So each of the four positions on the cyclopentadiene has a methyl. When it reacts, some of these methyl groups become substituents on the six-membered ring.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo transition state would place the substituents (like the O=C-O from the anhydride) on the same face as the substituents from the diene. So the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile.

So, in the adduct, the substituents from the diene (methyl groups) would be on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile. Therefore, some of these methyl groups would be close in space.

Now, considering the NOESY cross-peak: which two sets of protons would be close? Let me imagine the structure.

Suppose the adduct has two methyl groups that are adjacent or on the same face, leading to their protons being in proximity. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from the dienophile (the oxygen atoms) are close to some protons in the diene-derived part.

Wait, but the protons in the dienophile are not part of the diene; the dienophile is the electron-deficient species, like the anhydride. So in the adduct, the dienophile contributes two carbons (the ones from the anhydride), and the diene contributes four.

The adduct would have two new sigma bonds: the diene's ends (carbons 1 and 4) would connect to the dienophile's ends (the carbonyl carbons).

Wait, perhaps the endo rule leads to the substituents on the dienophile being on the same face as the substituents on the diene. So the methyl groups on the diene would be near the substituents on the dienophile.

But the substituents on the dienophile are the carbonyl groups. So, perhaps some of the diene's methyl groups are in proximity to the carbonyl oxygens.

But in the NMR, the question is about which two protons are cross-peaking. So, the cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space.

Looking at the options, perhaps the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm are methyl groups attached to the ring, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are protons adjacent to the oxygen (like in an ether or an ester group). Or maybe the 2H are those on the bridgehead of the anhydride part.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the oxygen bridge would become part of the six-membered ring. So the two carbonyls from the anhydride would now be part of the ring, leading to substituents like ester groups or ketones. Wait, no, the anhydride becomes part of the ring, so the oxygens would be within the ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl groups become part of the six-membered ring, so the ring has two ketone groups. Or maybe the ring has ester groups, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the dienophile (anhydride) contributes two carbonyl carbons, which become part of the six-membered ring. So in the product, the ring would have two carbonyl groups attached. But in anhydride, the structure is O=C-O-C=O. So when it reacts, each carbonyl carbon (C=O) would form a bond with a carbon from the diene. Thus, each of these carbons would have a substituent in the adduct.

So, in the adduct, the positions where the dienophile's carbons are attached would have carbonyl groups. So the substituents on the ring from the dienophile would be carbonyl groups, and the substituents from the diene would be the methyl groups.

Now, in the major product, the methyl groups from the diene would be arranged such that some are close to the carbonyl groups. But how does this relate to the NMR signals?

The 1H NMR of the major product has certain signals. The 2H at 3.5 ppm could be protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps they're part of an axial or equatorial position on a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the product of a Diels-Alder is a six-membered ring, which is typically a bicyclic structure if the dienophile is cyclic. Wait, the dienophile is a cyclic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring. When it reacts, the product would have a bridge? Or perhaps a fused ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure, but I'm not certain.

Assuming it's a simple six-membered ring, the dienophile's carbons are at positions 1 and 4 (if the diene is positions 1-4). So, perhaps in the adduct, the substituents from the dienophile (the carbonyl groups) are at positions 1 and 4, and the substituents from the diene are at positions 2 and 5 (or something similar).

But this might not be the right approach. Let me think about the NOESY cross-peak. The cross-peak in the major product suggests that two protons are near each other in space. So, in the structure, these two protons must be on adjacent carbons or on the same face of the ring.

Looking at the options, option B says a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So, perhaps the 6H are methyl groups, maybe attached to the cyclohexane ring, and the 2H are near the carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be from a methylene group (like -CH2-) adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen. Or perhaps they are part of an epoxide or another functional group.

Wait, the dienophile is an anhydride, so when it reacts, the oxygen bridge becomes part of the six-membered ring. So the product would have oxygen atoms in the ring. Therefore, the six-membered ring would have two ketone groups or ester groups, but more likely, the oxygens would be part of the ring as ether linkages or as carbonyl groups.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the coupling in the NOESY. So, the major product has a cross-peak between two sets of protons. Let's say one set is a methyl group, and the other is a methylene group.

Looking at the options, option B is a 6H singlet (probably three equivalent methyl groups) and a 2H singlet (maybe a -CH2- group). If these two are close in space, it's because they're on adjacent carbons or on the same face.

Wait, the diene is tetramethyl, so four methyl groups. But in the product, perhaps two of them are near each other or near the substituents from the dienophile.

Alternatively, the 6H singlet could be from two equivalent methyl groups (each with 3H), perhaps attached to adjacent carbons. But that would make 6H, but would that be a singlet? If they're equivalent in the structure, yes.

Wait, perhaps the 2H singlet at 3.5 is from a -OCH2- group. But an OCH2 would typically split into a quartet due to neighboring protons, unless it's in a symmetric environment. Hmm, but in the options, it's a singlet, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, the 2H at 3.5 ppm could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an axial position on a cyclohexane ring, making it a singlet if it's not split by neighboring protons.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the six-membered ring would have substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The substituents from the diene (methyl groups) would be on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's oxygens). So, perhaps the major product has methyl groups that are on the same side as the oxygen substituents.

In the structure, some methyl groups might be near the oxygen atoms, leading to the possibility of NOE interactions. But the 6H singlet suggests multiple equivalent methyl groups, perhaps all in similar environments.

Wait, but in the diene, there are four methyl groups. After the Diels-Alder reaction, some of these would end up adjacent in the product. For example, if two methyl groups from the diene are on adjacent carbons in the product, their methyl protons would be close, but they would be part of the same multiplet, not necessarily cross-peaking in NOESY.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups that are all equivalent due to symmetry. But wait, the diene has four methyl groups, which complicates that. Maybe two methyl groups are equivalent, giving a 6H singlet, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups attached to the same carbon, but that would be a quaternary carbon with three methyl groups, contributing 9H. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two methyl groups (each contributing 3H) attached to adjacent carbons, but in a symmetric environment, making them equivalent. Then, the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as part of a bridge or a substituent.

But how does this relate to the cross-peak? If the 6H singlet is from methyl groups attached to a carbon adjacent to the 2H singlet, then those protons would be in close proximity, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

So, the cross-peak would connect the methyl protons (6H) and the methylene protons (2H), meaning these two groups are close in space.

Looking at the options, option B is a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. The 6H being methyl groups (singlet, so no splitting) and the 2H being a singlet somewhere else.

So, in the major product, the cross-peak would be between the methyl groups and the methylene groups near oxygen. But why would that happen?

In the Diels-Alder product, the methyl groups from the diene would be positioned around the ring. If the 2H singlet is part of a bridge or adjacent to the oxygen substituent, then the methyl groups nearby would have their protons in proximity.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2H are part of the bridgehead in the cyclic structure, and the methyl groups are near that bridge.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: think about the diastereomers. The major product has a certain configuration where the substituents are on the same face, leading to a cross-peak. The minor product would have substituents on opposite faces, so no cross-peak.

So, in the major product, perhaps a methyl group is on the same face as the 2H group, leading to a NOE effect. In the minor product, these groups are on opposite faces, so no cross-peak.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A: 6H singlet (maybe three methyl groups) at 1 ppm and 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm. That doesn't seem to fit with the 2H I was thinking earlier.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. So, methyl groups and a methylene group.

Option C: Two singlets, 6H and 6H. So, perhaps two sets of methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 and 2H singlet at 3.5. Maybe a single methyl and a methylene.

The question says that the cross-peak is present in the major product but not in the minor. So, which two types of protons would be near each other only in the major?

Perhaps in the major product, the methyl groups are axial and close to the equatorial 2H group, leading to a NOE. In the minor, the methyl groups are equatorial and the 2H are axial, so no proximity.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Another angle: the diene is tetramethyl, so in the product, four methyl groups would be present, but perhaps some are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. C13H16O3: 2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X and N are zero. So (2*13 +2 -16)/2 = (28-16)/2=6. So 6 degrees of unsaturation. Which would include rings and double bonds.

The product is from a Diels-Alder reaction, so it would have a six-membered ring with possibly some substituents.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the six-membered ring is bicyclic? Or just a single ring? If it's a six-membered ring with substituents, perhaps one double bond is retained, but the diene and dienophile combine to form a new ring.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the NOESY. The cross-peak is between two sets of protons that are close in space. So, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons, or near each other in the structure.

In the options, option B has a 6H singlet (probably three methyl groups) and a 2H singlet (maybe a -CH2-O- group). If these are close, it would make sense for a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option D is a 1H doublet and 2H singlet. But why would a single proton be close to a 2H group?

Alternatively, the cross-peak might be between a methyl group and a bridgehead proton.

Wait, the dienophile is a cyclic anhydride, which when reacted, could form a bicyclic structure. So perhaps the product has a bridge, making some protons close.

In that case, a methyl group attached near the bridge would have protons close to the bridgehead protons.

Wait, but the bridgehead protons would typically be a single proton each. So perhaps the bridge has a -CH2- group, and a methyl group is attached nearby.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the 1H NMR shifts. The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm is probably methyl groups attached to a carbon that's near an electron-withdrawing group, like oxygen. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be a -CH2- group attached to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether linkage.

In the major product, the methyl groups are close to this -CH2-O- group, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

So, looking at the options, option B is a 6H singlet at 1.7 and a 2H singlet at 3.5.

Alternatively, if the 6H is from methyl groups attached to a carbon adjacent to the 2H, then this would be the case.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic anhydride (formed from a cis-dicarboxylic acid) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The reaction yields two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key difference between the products is the spatial arrangement of substituents, as indicated by the presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product but not in the minor product. This cross-peak suggests that two sets of protons are in close proximity in the major product.

### Analysis of the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR of the Anhydride**: A single peak at 7 ppm indicates the presence of vinyl protons, which are part of the cyclic anhydride structure.
2. **13C NMR of the Anhydride**: Peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm correspond to the bridgehead carbon and carbonyl carbons, respectively, consistent with a five-membered cyclic anhydride.

### Reaction and Products:
- The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring, incorporating two carbons from the anhydride (dienophile) and four carbons from the cyclopentadiene (diene). The reaction produces two diastereomers: a major product (endo transition state) and a minor product (exo transition state).
- The major product has substituents (methyl groups from the diene and carbonyl groups from the dienophile) on the same face of the ring, leading to spatial proximity of certain protons. The minor product lacks this proximity.

### NOESY Cross-Peak:
- The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product indicates that two sets of protons are spatially close. This is due to the specific stereochemistry of the major product, where certain protons are positioned on the same face of the ring.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.
- **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet likely corresponds to methyl groups, and the 2H singlet could represent a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen atom. These protons are likely in close proximity in the major product due to its stereochemistry.
- **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups, but it does not explain the cross-peak involving a 2H singlet.
- **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This pairing does not match the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet (likely methyl groups) at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet (likely a methylene group adjacent to oxygen) at ~3.5 ppm, consistent with the stereochemistry of the major product.
