Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, the question is about binary star systems and their masses. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods—2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think refers to the orbital period of the two stars around their common center of mass.

Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. In system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass here is the sum of the masses of the two stars in each system.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the masses can be determined using Kepler's laws. Specifically, the radial velocity method relies on the Doppler shift to measure the velocities of the stars as they orbit each other. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. Oh right, because the center of mass is the balance point—so the more massive object moves less.

So the key here is that the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of that star. So if I have two stars, M1 and M2, in a system, their velocities v1 and v2 are related by M1*v1 = M2*v2. Because the center of mass requires that the product of mass and velocity is the same for both.

Moreover, the mass function comes into play when you have binary stars. The mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. But since we have both velocity amplitudes, perhaps we don't need to go into the full mass function but can compare the masses directly.

Wait, but wait. The period is the same for both stars in a binary system, right? Oh yeah, because they orbit each other, so they share the same orbital period. The period given for each system is their orbital period. So both stars in system_1 have an orbital period of 2 years, and both in system_2 have a period of 1 year.

But wait, the problem states that the periods for each system are 2 and 1 years respectively, so each system has its own period. So system_1's period is 2 years, system_2's is 1 year.

Okay, so for each system, we can model it as two stars orbiting their common center of mass. The mass of each star is proportional to the velocity of the other. So in system_1, let's say star A has a velocity amplitude of 10 km/s and star B has 5 km/s. So M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B. So M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. So 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A is 0.5 times M_B. Therefore, the ratio M_A : M_B is 1:2. So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B. Wait, but I think I should express this in terms of their velocities.

Alternatively, since M1*v1 = M2*v2, M1/M2 = v2/v1. So for system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 is half of M2. Thus, the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (1/2 M2) + M2 = (3/2) M2. So the total mass is 1.5 times M2, but wait, that's for each system's individual stars. Wait no, no. No, wait, system_1's total is M1 + M2, and system_2's total is M1' + M2'.

Wait, maybe I need to model each system separately and find their total masses.

Let me think again. For each binary system, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2. From the center of mass condition, M1*v1 = M2*v2.

So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

In system_1: v1 =10 km/s, v2=5.

So M1/M2 =5/10= 1/2. So M1 is half of M2 in system_1. So the masses are in a 1:2 ratio. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (1/2)M2 + M2 = (3/2) M2. Wait, but wait, that's M2 being the mass of the second star in system_1. Hmm, perhaps I should represent the mass ratio better.

Wait, perhaps it's better to denote for system_1: M1 = mass of star A, M2 = mass of star B.

So M1*v1 = M2*v2.

v1 is 10, v2 is 5.

So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 = (1/2) M2.

So the total mass of system_1 is (1/2 M2) + M2 = 3/2 M2.

Wait, but that would be the total for system_1 in terms of M2 in system_1. Similarly, for system_2.

In system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10.

So M1' (star A in system_2) has v1' =15, M2' has v2' =10.

So M1'/M2' = v2' / v1' = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M1' = (2/3) M2'.

So the total mass of system_2 is M1' + M2' = (2/3) M2' + M2' = (5/3) M2'.

Wait, but I'm trying to compare the total masses of system_1 and system_2.

But I don't know M2 for system_1 and M2' for system_2. Hmm. Maybe I can relate them using the orbital periods.

Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula for the orbital period P is related to the total mass of the system and the size of the orbit. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) a³, where a is the separation between the two stars.

Wait, but I think that the formula in terms of velocities is more helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the mass function can be used, but I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, here's another approach. Since the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the respective stars, and the period is the same for each star in the same system, perhaps we can relate the masses across the two systems.

But wait, each system has a different orbital period. So perhaps I need to consider how the masses relate to each other through the periods.

Wait, let me think again. The orbital period P is the same for both stars in a system. The velocity amplitude of each star is related to the mass of the other star, the separation, and the period.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model each system's total mass.

Wait, I remember that the sum of the masses can be found using the formula M1 + M2 = (4π² a³) / (G P²), where a is the separation between the stars, but I don't have the value of a. Hmm. Alternatively, I can express the mass in terms of the velocities and the period.

Wait, perhaps the mass can be tied to the velocities and the period through the orbital mechanics equations.

Let me think: The velocity of each star is given by v = (2π a_i) / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass. a1 + a2 = a, the separation.

But since M1 a1 = M2 a2, because the center of mass is at M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

Then, the velocity v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So v1 = (2π a * M2)/( (M1 + M2) P )

Similarly, v2 = (2π a * M1)/( (M1 + M2) P )

So v1 / v2 = M2 / M1.

Which matches the earlier relation.

But how does this help me find the total mass?

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Let me denote system_1's masses as M1 and M2, and system_2's as M1' and M2'.

For system_1:

M1 = (v2_1 / v1_1) * M2_1

Wait, no, M1/M2 = v2_1 / v1_1.

Wait, earlier I determined that M1 = (v2_1 / v1_1) * M2.

So M1 = (5/10) M2 = (1/2) M2. So M1 + M2 = 3/2 M2.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1' = (v2_2 / v1_2) * M2' = (10/15) M2' = (2/3) M2'

So M1' + M2' = (2/3 + 1) M2' = (5/3) M2'

But I need to relate these total masses to each other. Hmm, but how?

Wait, Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to (M1 + M2) * a^3 / (G), but without knowing a, perhaps I can't directly compare. Alternatively, maybe I can relate the velocities and periods.

Wait, another approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function. The mass function f(M) = (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but in the case where the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on, which is when eclipses occur), sin i is 1. So f(M) = (M2³) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But I'm not sure if that's the way to go, because I don't have the actual velocities' relation to the masses without knowing the inclination or other parameters.

Wait, perhaps another way. The mass of the system can be found by the formula:

M_total = (v1^3 * P) / (2π G) )^(1/3)

Wait, wait, let me think. The formula for the mass function is f(M) = (v1^3 P) / (2π G) ), but that's for a single-lined spectroscopic binary, where only one star's velocity is observed. However, in this problem, both stars' velocities are given, so perhaps I can find the actual masses.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to approach this differently.

In each system, the sum of the two masses would be M_total = M1 + M2.

From the velocity amplitudes:

For system_1, M1 / M2 = v2 / v1 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2.

So M_total_1 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2: M1' / M2' = v2' / v1' =10/15 = 2/3 → M1' = (2/3) M2'.

So M_total_2 = (2/3) M2' + M2' = (5/3) M2'.

Now, I need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.

But to do that, I need to express M2 and M2' in terms that can be compared. Hmm, perhaps using the orbital periods.

Wait, the orbital period is related to the velocities and the masses. Let's think about the orbital period for each system.

The period P is the same for both stars in a binary system. The velocity of each star is v = 2π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass.

But since M1 a1 = M2 a2, and a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the stars), we can write a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

So v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (M2 a) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

Similarly, v2 = 2π a2 / P = 2π (M1 a) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

But from earlier, M1 = 0.5 M2 for system_1, so M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Thus, v1 = 2π (M2 a) / (1.5 M2 P) ) → simplifies to 2π a / (1.5 P) → (2π a)/(1.5 P) = (4π a)/(3 P)

Similarly, v2 = 2π (0.5 M2 a) / (1.5 M2 P ) → 2π (0.5 a) / (1.5 P ) → π a / (1.5 P ) → (2 π a)/(3 P )

Wait, but for system_1, v1 is 10 km/s and v2 is 5 km/s. So v1 = 10, v2=5.

From system_1, v1 = (4 π a )/(3 P ), and v2 = (2 π a )/(3 P )

So the ratio v1/v2 is (4 π a /3 P ) / (2 π a /3 P ) ) = 2. Which matches the given system_1 velocities (10 and 5 → ratio 2).

So that makes sense.

Now, let's express the total mass M_total_1 in terms of a and P.

Wait, from Kepler's third law: (a)^3 / (P^2) = G (M_total_1) / (4 π² )

So M_total_1 = (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G P² )

But from earlier, v1 = (4 π a )/(3 P ), so rearranging:

a = (v1 * 3 P ) / (4 π )

Substitute into M_total_1:

M_total_1 = (4 π² [ (3 v1 P /4 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G P² )

Let me compute this.

First, cube the a term:

(3 v1 P /4 π )^3 = (27 v1^3 P^3 ) / (64 π^3 )

So,

M_total_1 = (4 π² * 27 v1^3 P^3 ) / ( 64 π^3 G P² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² * 27 v1^3 P^3 → numerator.

Denominator: 64 π^3 G P².

So,

= (4 * 27 v1^3 P ) / (64 π G )

Simplify the constants:

4/64 = 1/16 → 27/(16 π G )

So,

M_total_1 = (27 v1^3 P ) / (16 π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

v1' =15, P=1 year.

But wait, the same approach applies. Let me write the formula for M_total_2.

M_total_2 = (27 v1'^3 P' ) / (16 π G )

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which star has v1'? Because in system_2, the two velocities are 15 and 10. So for system_2, the velocity amplitudes are v1'=15 and v2'=10.

But earlier, for each system, I considered v1 as the velocity of the first star and v2 as the second. So for system_2, using the same approach.

But since in our earlier derivation, we used v1 for the velocity, perhaps for system_2, I should use v1'=15 as the primary velocity. But wait, earlier in system_1, v1 was 10, which was the larger velocity.

Wait, the formula I derived earlier for M_total is based on using v1, which is the velocity of the first star. But in the system, which velocity should I use?

Wait, perhaps I should use the same approach. Let me think again.

In the derivation, I used v1 = velocity of star 1, which is the more massive star's velocity? Or the less massive? No, wait, in system_1, the star with velocity 10 is less massive than the star with velocity 5.

Wait, no, because M1 is inversely proportional to v1. So in system_1, M1 is 0.5 M2, so M2 is more massive. So v2 is 5 km/s, which is smaller, which means M2 is larger.

So when I derived the formula M_total_1 = (27 v1^3 P )/(16 π G ), that would be using the primary velocity, which in this case is v1=10, which is the velocity of the less massive star.

Wait, but does the formula hold regardless of which velocity I use? Let me think. Because in the derivation, I used v1, the velocity of the first star, which can be either component. So perhaps it doesn't matter which velocity I use as long as I'm consistent within each system.

Wait, but for system_2, I have two velocities: 15 and 10. So which one do I use in the formula?

Hmm, perhaps it doesn't matter because the formula depends on the velocity of one star, and the other is determined via the mass ratio.

Wait, but let me check. Let's say for system_2, I use v1' =15, which is the velocity of one star. Then M_total_2 would be (27 * (15)^3 *1 )/(16 π G )

Similarly, if I had used v2' =10, would that give a different result? Let's see.

Wait, in the previous steps, I used v1 as the velocity of the first star, which is (M2 a )/( (M1 + M2) P ) * 2π.

But perhaps the formula is more correctly expressed using the velocity of the star that is more massive.

Wait, perhaps I should use the larger mass's velocity. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity, so using a smaller velocity might give a different result.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me just proceed with the formula as I derived it.

So, for system_1:

v1=10, P=2 years.

So M_total_1 = (27 * (10)^3 * 2 )/(16 π G )

For system_2:

v1'=15, P'=1 year.

M_total_2 = (27 * (15)^3 * 1 )/(16 π G )

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which velocity do I use? Because the velocities are 15 and 10. If I choose v1'=15, then M_total_2 would be (27 *15^3 *1 )/(16 pi G). But in reality, perhaps the correct approach is to use the velocity of the more massive star, which would be the smaller velocity. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity.

Wait, in system_2, the velocity amplitudes are 15 and10. The more massive star would have the smaller velocity, so 10 km/s. So perhaps I should use v1'=10, not 15.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The mass is inversely proportional to velocity, so the star with v1'=15 has a mass that's smaller than the one with v2'=10.

Because M1' / M2' = v2' / v1' =10/15=2/3 → M1' = (2/3) M2'

So the more massive star is M2' with velocity 10, because M2' is larger than M1'.

So the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So for the formula, perhaps I should use the velocity of the more massive star, which is 10 km/s.

Wait, but earlier, I used the velocity of the first star in the formula. So perhaps I should adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula holds regardless of which velocity I use, as long as I'm consistent within the system.

Wait, perhaps I should not use the velocity of the more massive star but instead use the velocity of the star that is observed.

Wait, but in the problem, both velocities are given for each system. So perhaps the formula should be applied to the sum of the velocities?

No, that doesn't make sense. Each velocity contributes to the mass function, but perhaps to get the total mass, I need to use both.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the formula.

The formula I derived earlier for M_total is:

M_total = (27 * v^3 * P ) / (16 π G )

But wait, that formula was derived by assuming that v is the velocity of one of the stars, and I used the mass ratio to find the total mass. So perhaps I should use the same v for both stars.

Wait, but in a binary system, each star's velocity relates to the other's mass. So the formula for M_total depends on the velocity of either star, but since in the formula v is a variable, perhaps using either velocity would give the same M_total.

Wait, that can't be, because using v1 and v2 would give different results. So perhaps the formula is not correct as I derived it.

Hmm, perhaps a different approach is needed. Let me think about the mass function again.

Wait, the mass function f(M) is defined as f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But in an eclipsing binary, the inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin i =1.

So f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But the mass function can also be expressed in terms of the observed velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

So, f(M1) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Similarly, f(M2) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

But wait, the mass function is the same for both stars, because f(M) depends on the system.

Wait, that's not correct. The mass function is a function of the system, so it's the same for both stars. So f(M) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

Which would only be possible if v1 = v2, which is not the case in the problem.

Wait, that suggests that my approach is incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the mass function is the same for both components, so:

(v1^3 P )/(2 π G ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

But that's only possible if v1 = v2, which isn't the case here. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, no, because the mass function is the same for both components, so:

f(M) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

But in reality, this can't be true unless v1 = v2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Ah, I think I mixed up the definitions. The mass function is defined as (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where M2 is the mass of the companion.

So if I have a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where both velocities are observed, I can relate them.

Wait, perhaps I should use both velocities and the period to find the total mass.

Let me try this approach.

Given that in system_1, velocities are v1 =10, v2=5, and period P=2 years.

From the mass function, which is same for both stars:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Similarly, for the other star:

f(M) = (M1^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

Since f(M) is the same for both, we can set these equal:

(M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

(M1^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

So both expressions equal the same f(M), so they are equal to each other.

So:

(M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

(M1^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

So, dividing the first equation by the second:

(M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )) ) / ( M1^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) ) = (v1^3 P )/(v2^3 P )

The (M1+M2)^2 terms cancel out.

So, (M2^3 / M1^3 ) = (v1^3 / v2^3 )

Taking cube roots on both sides: M2/M1 = v1/v2.

Which brings us back to M2 = (v1/v2) * M1.

Which is consistent with earlier findings.

But this doesn't give us the total mass yet. Perhaps I should express the total mass in terms of the mass function.

Wait, let's denote M_total = M1 + M2.

From the first equation:

(M2^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) ) = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Similarly,

(M1^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) ) = (v2^3 P )/(2 π G )

Adding these two equations:

(M1^3 + M2^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) = (v1^3 + v2^3 ) P/(2 π G )

But M1^3 + M2^3 = (M1 + M2)(M1² - M1 M2 + M2² )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since I'm trying to find the ratio of M_total for system_1 and system_2, perhaps I can set up a ratio between them.

Let me denote for system_1:

M_total_1 = M1 + M2.

From the mass function equation:

(M2^3 ) / (M_total_1^2 ) = (v1^3 P1 )/(2 π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

(M2'^3 ) / (M_total_2^2 ) = (v1'^3 P2 )/(2 π G )

But I'm not sure. Let me try to express M_total_1 and M_total_2 in terms of their respective velocities and periods.

Wait, perhaps I can express M_total_1 as:

M_total_1 = ( (v1^3 P1 )/(2 π G ) )^(1/3) * ( M_total_1^2 / M2^3 )^(1/3) )

Hmm, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express M_total in terms of the velocity and period.

Wait, I think I need to re-express the mass function in terms of the known variables.

The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i =1, f(M) = M2^3 / (M_total^2 )

And f(M) is also equal to (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

So,

M2^3 / M_total^2 = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

So,

M_total^3 = (M2^3 ) * (2 π G )/(v1^3 P )

But M2 = (M_total) * ( M2/(M1 + M2) ) ) = M_total * ( M2 / M_total )

Wait, perhaps I can express M2 in terms of M_total and the mass ratio.

From earlier:

M1/M2 = v2 / v1 → M1 = (v2/v1) M2.

So,

M_total = M1 + M2 = (v2/v1 M2 ) + M2 = M2 ( 1 + v2/v1 ) = M2 ( (v1 + v2 ) / v1 )

So,

M2 = M_total * ( v1 ) / ( v1 + v2 )

Substituting into the mass function equation:

M2^3 / M_total^2 = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

So,

( [ M_total (v1)/(v1 + v2) ]^3 ) / M_total^2 = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Simplify:

M_total^3 * (v1^3 ) / (v1 + v2 )^3 ) / M_total^2 = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

So,

M_total * (v1^3 ) / (v1 + v2 )^3 = (v1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Cancel v1^3 from both sides:

M_total / (v1 + v2 )^3 = P/(2 π G )

So,

M_total = [ P (v1 + v2 )^3 ] / (2 π G )

Ah, this expression might be useful. So the total mass can be calculated as:

M_total = [ P (v1 + v2 )^3 ] / (2 π G )

Wait, does that make sense?

Let me check for system_1: P=2 years, v1=10, v2=5.

So,

M_total_1 = [ 2 * (10 +5)^3 ] / (2 π G )

= [ 2 * 15^3 ] / ( 2 π G )

= (2 * 3375 ) / ( 2 π G )

= 3375 / (π G )

Similarly, for system_2: P=1 year, v1=15, v2=10.

M_total_2 = [1 * (15 +10)^3 ] / (2 π G )

= (25)^3 / (2 π G )

= 15625 / (2 π G )

Now, I need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.

M_total_1 = 3375/(π G )

M_total_2 = 15625/(2 π G )

So,

Ratio = (3375/(π G )) / (15625/(2 π G )) )

The π G terms cancel out.

So,

= (3375 * 2 ) / 15625

= 6750 / 15625

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25= 270, 15625/25=625.

So 270/625.

Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 54/125.

54 ÷ 125 = 0.432.

So approximately 0.432.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option D is ~0.7. Hmm, 0.432 is closer to 0.4 than 0.6.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Compute 3375 *2= 6750.

Divide by 15625.

6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

Yes, so the ratio is approximately 0.432.

So system_1's total mass is about 0.432 times that of system_2. Wait, no, wait! Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432, so system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive, not more. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.432 is less than 1, system_1 is less massive than system_2. So the factor would be approximately 0.432, so system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than 1.

Wait, but looking back, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I should have used the velocities in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I derived is M_total = [ P (v1 + v2 )^3 ] / (2 π G )

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think about the units. Velocity is in km/s, period in years. But the gravitational constant G has units that require the mass to be in solar masses or kilograms, depending on the system.

But perhaps the formula is correct, but the ratio would be based on the way I applied it. 

Wait, but let me check again the calculation for the ratio:

M_total_1 = (2 * (15)^3 )/(2 π G )

M_total_2 = (1 * (25)^3 )/(2 π G )

So,

M_total_1 = (2*3375)/(2 π G ) = 3375/(π G )

M_total_2 = (1*15625)/(2 π G )

So,

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (3375/(π G )) / (15625/(2 π G )) )

= (3375 * 2 ) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

So the ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. So system_1's mass is about 0.4 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question asks, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So the factor would be 0.4. So the answer is approximately 0.4, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Did I correctly apply the formula? Because the formula uses (v1 + v2 ), which is the sum of the velocities. But in reality, the velocities are in opposite directions, so their magnitudes add up.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the sum of the velocities.

Wait, no, because for the purpose of the formula, it's the sum of the velocity amplitudes that matters, not the vector sum. So perhaps the formula is correct.

So, the answer would be approximately 0.4, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and total mass in binary systems. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = \frac{P (v_1 + v_2)^3}{2 \pi G}
\]

where \(P\) is the orbital period, \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant.

### System_1:
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total mass:
\[
M_{\text{total,1}} = \frac{P_1 (v_{1,1} + v_{2,1})^3}{2 \pi G} = \frac{2 (10 + 5)^3}{2 \pi G} = \frac{2 \cdot 15^3}{2 \pi G} = \frac{3375}{\pi G}
\]

### System_2:
- Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total mass:
\[
M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{P_2 (v_{1,2} + v_{2,2})^3}{2 \pi G} = \frac{1 (15 + 10)^3}{2 \pi G} = \frac{1 \cdot 25^3}{2 \pi G} = \frac{15625}{2 \pi G}
\]

### Mass Ratio:
The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{\frac{3375}{\pi G}}{\frac{15625}{2 \pi G}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Interpretation:
The total mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the total mass of system_2. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is **more massive** than system_2, the factor is approximately \(0.4\), corresponding to option A.
