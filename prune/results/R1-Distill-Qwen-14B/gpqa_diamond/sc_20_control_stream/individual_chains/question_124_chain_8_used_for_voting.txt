Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, they’re asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So the main point here is about the relationship between the Lorentz factor and how far a particle travels before decaying. I remember that the decay length has something to do with the Lorentz factor. Decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying, right?

So, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The distance from the center to the inner wall is 30 meters. The problem says that when the Lorentz factor is 20, only one third of the particles make it to the inner wall. So, that implies that the average decay length for these particles is such that only a third reach 30 meters. So, the decay length (L) is such that when L is 30 meters, only a third survive, or perhaps the probability is one third.

Wait, I think I should model this with an exponential decay formula. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance x is given by P = exp(-x / L), where L is the decay length, which itself is gamma times the mean lifetime (c times gamma tau, I think, since L = gamma c tau, but c is speed of light, and tau is proper lifetime). So, the decay probability is exponential.

In the given situation, at gamma =20, the probability that a particle reaches the wall (30m) is 1/3. So, we can write:

1/3 = exp(-30 / L)

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30 / L

Which means:

- ln(3) = -30 / L => ln(3) = 30 / L, so L = 30 / ln(3).

Wait, ln(3) is approximately 1.0986. So L ≈ 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters.

Wait, but wait, I thought that the decay length L is proportional to gamma. Because L = gamma * c tau. So if gamma changes, L changes proportionally.

So, if for gamma1 =20, L1=30/(ln(3)).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute L when gamma is 20.

So, when gamma is 20, the decay length L1 is (gamma)* c tau. But in that case, the probability is 1/3 when x=30m. So using the equation:

P = exp( -x/(gamma c tau) ) = 1/3.

Because x is 30 meters. So,

exp(-30/(20 * c tau)) = 1/3.

Taking natural log:

-30/(20 c tau) = ln(1/3) => 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

So, 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986.

Simplify 30/(20) = 1.5. So, 1.5 / (c tau) = 1.0986.

Thus,

c tau = 1.5 / 1.0986 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Wait, c tau is the proper decay length, right? Because the proper lifetime tau is the lifetime in the rest frame, and c tau would be the distance light travels in that time. So, in the rest frame, the particle's lifetime is tau, and the speed is c, so the maximum distance it could travel before decaying is c tau.

But when the particle is moving at a high speed (relativistic), its lifetime is longer due to time dilation, so the decay length increases.

So, the decay length L is gamma * c tau.

So, for the initial case, gamma=20, L1=20 * c tau.

Wait, but from earlier, we have c tau=1.365 meters. So L1=20 *1.365= 27.3 meters. Which makes sense because when x=30 meters, only a third of the particles reach that point.

So, if the detector is 30 meters in radius, and the decay length is 27.3 meters, that's why only 1/3 reach the wall.

Now, the question is, what gamma is needed so that two-thirds reach the wall. So, when x=30 meters, P=2/3.

So, starting again:

P = exp( -x/(gamma * c tau) ) = 2/3.

Take ln of both sides:

- x/(gamma c tau) = ln(2/3).

So,

x/(gamma c tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

We know x=30 meters, and from before, c tau was found to be approximately 1.365 meters.

Wait, let me plug in the known value of c tau. Because earlier when gamma was 20, c tau was 1.365 meters.

So, substituting into the equation:

30/(gamma * 1.365) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the equation.

We have:

x/(gamma * c tau) = ln(3/2)

Because when P=2/3, the equation is:

exp(-x/(gamma c tau)) = 2/3.

Taking ln:

- x/(gamma c tau) = ln(2/3) → x/(gamma c tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).

So,

gamma = x / (c tau * ln(3/2)).

But we already have c tau from the first part. Earlier, when gamma was 20,

c tau =1.365 meters.

So, plug that in:

gamma = 30 m / (1.365 m * 0.4055).

Let me compute the denominator: 1.365 * 0.4055 ≈ 0.553.

So, gamma ≈ 30 / 0.553 ≈ 54.27.

Hmm, which is approximately 54. So the Lorentz factor needed is around 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. Option B is 68, C is 40, D is 28.

So, the correct answer should be A) 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, decay length, and probability of survival.

The probability that a particle survives decay and travels a distance \( x \) is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{x}{\gamma c \tau}\right),
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( x \) is the distance traveled. The decay length \( L \) is related to \( \gamma \) by \( L = \gamma c \tau \).

### Step 1: Decay length for \( \gamma = 20 \)
From the problem, when \( \gamma = 20 \), only one-third of the particles reach the inner wall of the detector, which is 30 meters away. Thus:

\[
P = \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{\gamma c \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma c \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{30}{\gamma c \tau}.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma c \tau \):

\[
\gamma c \tau = \frac{30}{\ln(3)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \):

\[
\gamma c \tau \approx \frac{30}{1.0986} \approx 27.3 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Thus, for \( \gamma = 20 \), the decay length \( L \) is approximately 27.3 meters.

### Step 2: Relating decay length to \( \gamma \)
The decay length \( L \) is proportional to \( \gamma \), i.e., \( L = \gamma c \tau \). Therefore, if \( \gamma \) changes, \( L \) changes proportionally.

### Step 3: Finding \( \gamma \) for \( P = \frac{2}{3} \)
We now seek the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) such that two-thirds of the particles reach the inner wall (30 meters). Using the survival probability formula:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{x}{\gamma c \tau}\right).
\]

For \( P = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = 30 \, \text{m} \):

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{\gamma c \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma c \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{30}{\gamma c \tau}.
\]

Using \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma c \tau = \frac{30}{0.4055} \approx 74.0 \, \text{meters}.
\]

From Step 1, we know \( \gamma c \tau \approx 27.3 \, \text{meters} \) when \( \gamma = 20 \). Since \( \gamma c \tau \propto \gamma \), we can find the new \( \gamma \) as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{74.0}{27.3} \cdot 20 \approx 54.27.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54. Among the given options, the closest value is:

**A) 54.**
