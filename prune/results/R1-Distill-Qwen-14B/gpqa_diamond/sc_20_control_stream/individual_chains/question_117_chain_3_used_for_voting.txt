Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? And those stereoisomers are due to chiral centers or some other kind of asymmetry in the molecule.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, so the two benzene rings are connected, making a biphenyl structure. Now, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. But if they're arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it could have optical isomers.

In this case, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. Let me visualize this. The biphenyl has two benzene rings attached at position 1. On each ring, at position 2, there's a carboxylate group, and at position 6, a nitro group. So, on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but if the two rings are attached at 1 and 1', and each has substituents at 2 and 6, do these positions mirror each other?

Wait, maybe the arrangement is such that the substituents are in positions that create a plane of symmetry. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, the presence of two identical substituents on each ring could lead to a plane of symmetry. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. Or maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, consider if the substituents are on opposite sides. Wait, but in biphenyls, the positions can rotate around the central bond. So maybe the molecule can have axial substituents that can't be mirrored, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps this compound has two nitro groups and two carboxylate groups. Maybe the arrangement of substituents leads to a chiral center in the biphenyl system. Wait, no, because biphenyl rings themselves don't have chiral centers, but the substituents' arrangement can create chirality if there's no plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me think about the biphenyl structure. If each ring has two substituents at 2 and 6, but the way they're arranged could create a situation where the molecule is not symmetrical. So for example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side, or opposite, but maybe that leads to different configurations. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects through the central bond, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should move on and come back to it.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH, and the ester would replace the -OH from the acid with -OCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, structure is OMe-O-C-O-C(OH)CH3?

Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH in the COOH becomes OMe, so the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center.

Looking at the carbon chain: The central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from CH3-),
- One OH group,
- One COOCH3 group,
- And another CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Ah, wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me draw it.

Propanoic acid: CH3CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH but that's not right. Let's number: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so the chain is CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So it's CH3-CHOH-COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the -OH of the COOH becomes OMe. So the structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the second carbon (the one with the OH). It's connected to:

- A CH3 group,
- A COOCH3 group,
- An OH group,
- And a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let's think: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (top),
- COOCH3 (right),
- And a hydrogen on the bottom? So yes, four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That means it has a chiral center. So this molecule has optical isomerism because it has a chiral center, so it can exhibit enantiomerism. So compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Compound 3: benzophenone. That's a ketone where two benzene rings are attached to a carbonyl group. Structure is Ph-CO-Ph. So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. Wait, does that create a chiral center? No, because the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups and an oxygen double bond. So the substituents on the central carbon are: two phenyl groups (same), one O (double bond, so no rotation), and maybe a hydrogen? No, wait, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and nothing else? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and one single bond to the other O? No, wait, no. The carbonyl group is C=O, so the central carbon in benzophenone is C connected to two Ph groups and one O (double bond), and no other substituent. So, the groups are Ph, Ph, O (double bond), and what else? Wait, no, wait: the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So each Ar is a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups, one oxygen (double bond), and another substituent? No, wait, the carbonyl is Ar-C=O. So the central carbon is connected to two Ar (phenyl) groups and the carbonyl O. Wait, but a carbonyl is a double bond, so it's C=O, so the carbon can't have four substituents. Wait, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the central carbon is connected to two Ar groups, and the O is double bonded. So, the central carbon has two Ar groups and a double bond O. So the substituents are Ar, Ar, O (double bond), and nothing else. So that's three substituents. Wait, no, wait: the carbonyl group is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the central C is connected to two Ar groups, an O (double bond), and then what? Oh, wait, wait: no, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So, the carbonyl is Ar–C(=O)–Ar, which is O=C(Ph)2.

Wait, so the central carbon is the one in the C=O. So the C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So this C has two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and no other substituents. So it's connected to two same groups (Ph), one O (double bond), and that's it. So, the substituents on the central carbon are two same (Ph), and one O (double bond). So no chiral center here because it's attached to two identical groups. So benzophenone doesn't have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, are there any other possibilities? Could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. The two phenyl groups are attached symmetrically on either side of the carbonyl group. So the molecule is planar, and the two phenyl groups are mirror images across the carbonyl. So it's symmetrical. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid has the structure HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When it's converted to dimethyl fumarate, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but wait, no, wait: fumaric acid is (E)-HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So, when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents on each end are COOH. So when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond in the middle. So the structure is trans, meaning the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: no, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Let me think. No, no, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is the E isomer, so the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, sorry, I'm mixing up the structure. So, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, more accurately, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, that's succinic acid. So, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So, when esterified with methanol, each of the two acidic hydrogens (from the COOH groups) would be replaced by OMe. So the structure becomes CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3? No, no, wait. No, wait, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3? That's not correct because the double bond is present. So it should be CH₂(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3, but wait, that's not right in terms of connectivity. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, the correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with double bond between the two CH groups, making it a trans configuration.

So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure where each COOH is replaced by COOCH3. So, it's (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, that would lose the double bond. Wait, no, the double bond is in the center. So fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3? No, because that would imply a single bond. Oh, wait no, I'm getting confused with the structure. Let me think again.

Fumaric acid: structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same carbon chain, connected by a double bond in the middle. So, when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, no, wait, that's four carbons. Wait, so it's:

The structure is:

O
|| 
COOCH3 - CH₂ - CH₂ - COOCH3 ?

No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the actual structure of fumarate is:

O
|| 
COOCH3 - C = C - COOCH3

Because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, becomes CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, wait, no, the correct structure is that each of the two terminal COOH groups is esterified. So, the fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait. Let me think clearly.

Wait, fumaric acid is a diacid with the structure HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the four carbons are arranged as:

HOOC - CH₂ - CH₂ - COOH. No, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so it's a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C2 and C3, and each end has a COOH group.

So, when esterified with two equivalents of methanol, the structure becomes CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be right, because the middle is a double bond. So the correct structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, that would be a single bond. Wait, no, no—since fumaric acid has a double bond between the two CH groups, the ester would have the same double bond. So the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right because the COOCH3 is on the same carbon as the CH₂. Let me try to draw it correctly.

The structure is:

O
|| 
COOCH3 - C = C - COOCH3.

Wait, that's not possible because the central carbons are double-bonded. So each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. So, structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2OCH3? No, perhaps it's better to imagine as:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So:

CH2(COOCH3) - CH2 - COOCH3? No, that's not right with the double bond. Ah, so the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, but that would imply each end of the double bond has a CH2 group with COOCH3. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached.

So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–CH2–COOCH3? No, that's a single bond. I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on a double bond, making it a trans-diesters. So, the molecule would have a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So, in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry? Or would it have a chiral center?

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, both ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, so the molecule would have a trans configuration. The structure would be (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that's not the right way. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. Wait, no, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, I think I'm complicating this. Let me think about whether this compound can have optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from stereoisomerism, which can be due to chiral centers or geometric isomerism (cis/trans) leading to different configurations.

Wait, but wait, is there a possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral? Let's see. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then looking at the molecule, it might have a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the molecule is symmetric, it won't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral. But wait, if the two ester groups are on the same side, that would be cis, but in dimethyl fumarate, it's the trans configuration. So, does the trans configuration have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same. For example, each has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group (maybe), so the molecule might be symmetrical. Alternatively, if each double bond carbon is attached to two identical groups, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each has two different substituents, but perhaps the arrangement makes the molecule symmetrical. Let me think: if the two double-bonded carbons each have a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but arranged in a symmetric way, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but that depends on whether the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, the molecule may be chiral if the arrangement lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So, the substituents on each double bond carbon are opposite each other. So, for each carbon in the double bond, one substituent is COOCH3, and the other is CH2. So, for the first carbon, substituents are COOCH3 and CH2 (which is connected to another CH2 group?), and for the second carbon, substituents are COOCH3 and CH2 as well. Hmm, but perhaps they are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see, any carbon with four different substituents? The carbons in the ester groups are attached to OMe, O, COOCH3, and adjacent carbons. Wait, the carbons in the ester groups are attached to OCH3, O, COOCH3, and the central double bond. Are any of these carbons chiral?

The central carbons are part of the double bond, so they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four single bonds. The carbons in the ester groups are attached as follows: each ester group is O=C-OCH3. The carbon attached to OCH3 is the carbonyl C, which is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to the adjacent C. That's not a chiral center. The other ester carbons (like the CH2 groups) are attached to two identical CH2 groups, perhaps, so they wouldn't be chiral.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, that can't be right because fumarate has four carbons: two from the diacid. So the correct structure is:

The molecule is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, that's five carbons. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
COOCH3 - C = C - COOCH3.

So each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group? No, that's not correct because in fumaric acid, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, it's CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, which would have four carbons in the chain. So the central two are double-bonded.

Wait, but in that case, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group. So each double-bonded C has two different substituents: one is COOCH3, the other is CH₂ (connected to another CH₂ group or something else).

Wait, maybe in this structure, each of the two double-bonded C's has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group. So if the substituents on each C are the same (COOCH3 and CH₂), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

But no, wait. Each double-bonded C is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH₂. If the substituents on each are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So in this case, if each of the two double-bonded Cs has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group, then the molecule would be symmetric, and thus not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-configured, making it symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because I remember that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, and it's used in some reactions where stereochemistry matters. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. If each of the double-bonded carbons has different substituents, then the molecule wouldn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: one double-bonded C has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the other has a COOCH3 and another group. No, in fumarate, both ends are the same, so the substituents on each double-bonded C are same. So, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral.

Wait, I'm so confused. Let me try another approach. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? If not, then perhaps it only has geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but not optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has two identical parts, making it achiral. But wait, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate isn't chiral. Because the configuration is trans, making the molecule symmetrical. So, there's a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making the two halves mirror images. So, no chiral centers, and the molecule is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought that in some cases, even with a plane of symmetry, if the molecule has a stereogenic center, it would be chiral. But in this case, the substituents on each double bond are same, so no chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another aspect. If a compound has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Yes. For example, imagine the double bond as a mirror. If each side is a mirror image, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because I've read that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, and diastereomers have different physical properties, but not necessarily optical isomerism. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the ester groups are on a double bond, but perhaps the molecule itself isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each double bond are not identical. Wait, no, in fumarate, each double bond C has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, the substituents are the same on each double bond C, so the molecule is symmetrical.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about geometric isomerism, but that's different from optical isomerism. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has cis and trans isomers, which are geometric isomers, but whether they exhibit optical isomerism is different.

Wait, but no, geometric isomerism doesn't imply optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from the presence of a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images. So, if the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and is symmetrical, it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, so perhaps dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. But wait, I've read before that dimethyl maleate is a chiral compound because it has a chiral center. Wait, no, dimethyl maleate is (Z)-dimethyl maleate, and I think that the structure may have a chiral center.

Wait, let's compare. Maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it becomes dimethyl maleate: (Z)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, but wait, let's think about the structure again. No, maleic acid is (Z), which would have the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond. When esterified, the structure would have the two COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond.

In that case, the molecule would not be symmetrical, leading to a chiral center. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is a chiral center. Let me imagine:

The structure of dimethyl maleate is (Z)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, wait, that's not correct. The correct structure would be (Z)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, no, the double bond is present. So for maleic acid, it's (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, esterified, becomes (Z)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more accurately written as:

O
||
COOCH3 - C=C - COOCH3

But in the (Z) configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure would look like this:

      O
      ||
COOCH3 - C
        \
         C=C
        /
      COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of the double bond as CH=CH, with each CH attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two central CHs. So:

CH₂(COOCH3) - CH₂
               \
                C=C
               /
              CH₂(COOCH3)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but that's four carbons. So, each end of the double bond is attached to a CH₂(COOCH3) group. So, in that case, each of the two central CHs has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, considering that, each of the central CHs would have a COOCH3, a CH₂ group, and a double bond. So, each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group attached. So, each CH would have two different substituents, making them chiral centers. Wait, no, because the CH is part of a double bond, so it's sp² hybridized, not sp³. So, it can't be a chiral center because chiral centers require four single bonds.

So, in this case, the two double-bonded carbons are each attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH₂ group. Each of these carbons would have three substituents (COOCH3, CH₂, and the double bond), but no, because the double bond is a substituent as well. Wait, in sp² hybridized carbons, each has three substituents plus the double bond.

So, in this scenario, each of the double-bonded carbons in dimethyl maleate is attached to a COOCH3, a CH₂, and the double bond. So, they're not chiral centers because they're sp² hybridized and don't have four different substituents.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule as a whole is not symmetrical, leading to optical isomerism. But if it's symmetrical, then no. So, in dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Whereas in dimethyl maleate, the substituents are on the same side, making the molecule not symmetrical, so perhaps it's chiral.

Wait, but no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about each molecule. If dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. Whereas dimethyl maleate doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism in each of the four given compounds. So, for compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, is it chiral?

If it's the trans isomer, then it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, I thought that the trans isomer of something like 2-pentene is achiral because of the plane of symmetry. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is achiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Wait, another thought: some compounds can have stereocenters even if they have a plane of symmetry. But that's not possible because a plane of symmetry would make the molecule achiral.

So, going back, I think compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, is not chiral, thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recap:

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

I think I should analyze this structure again. The molecule has two benzene rings connected at position 1 and 1'. On each ring, at position 2, there's a carboxylate group, and at position 6, a nitro group. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, how does that affect the symmetry?

Looking at the structure, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each benzene ring is attached at position 1. So, if I have a substituent at 2 on each ring, which is adjacent to position 1. Similarly, substituents at 6 are on the opposite side.

Wait, but in a biphenyl, the substituents can be arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent a mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry. Let me think: if each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or perhaps it's asymmetrical, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps you can have a situation where the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the whole molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I'm not certain about this one. Maybe I'll have to make a decision here.

So, to recap the analysis of each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: ?

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: yes, chiral center → optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone: no chiral center → no optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate: plane of symmetry → no optical isomerism.

So, among the four, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, I don't see an option where only 2 is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → only 2 is correct in my analysis.

B) 3 and 4 → both no.

C) 2 and 3 → I thought 3 doesn't have it.

D) 1 and 2 → I'm not sure about 1.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the two central CHs are attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each of the two CHs in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, the substituents on each double bond are same, leading to a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism.

But if the molecule is symmetrical, then no optical isomerism. So, 4 doesn't have it.

So, in the four options, only 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 2 selected. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 1, 2, and 4 → implies 3 are correct.

Option B: 3 and 4 → no, both no.

Option C: 2 and 3 → no.

Option D: 1 and 2 → perhaps 1 is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake on compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each biphenyl ring has nitro groups at 6 and carboxylates at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring is connected at position 1. The substituents at 2 are on the adjacent positions, and 6 are on the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in a way that the molecule as a whole has no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that their positions on each ring are not mirror images, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about this, but perhaps this molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, if that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2, making option D correct.

But I'm not confident about compound 1. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a symmetrical way, making the molecule not chiral.

Wait, let me think about the positions. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other (since in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1, so across would be position 4, perhaps). Wait, no, in a benzene ring, the positions are numbered such that adjacent positions are 1-2-3-4-5-6. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is the position before 1.

Wait, so if each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting position 1, then the substituents on each ring are in positions that are adjacent to the point of connection. So, each ring has substituents on either side of the connecting position.

But in that case, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are on each ring in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be achiral, thus no optical isomerism.

So, if that's true, then compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So, only compound 2 does.

But then, looking at the options, I don't see any option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, none of the options have only 2 selected. Hmm. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I missed something about compound 1. Let me think again: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions arranged in a way that makes the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a situation where the molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, another approach: the molecule may have two identical substituents on each ring, but arranged in a way that the entire molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create an asymmetric arrangement when considering both rings together.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents creates a situation where the molecule is chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, making option D the correct choice.

But I'm not entirely confident about compound 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other sources of information or recognize that the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2, 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, based on my analysis:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 1: uncertain, but perhaps yes.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: no.

So, if compound 1 has optical isomerism, then the correct option would be D (1 and 2).

But if compound 4 has it, then option A (1,2,4) would be correct.

But earlier analysis suggested that compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm.

I think I need to make a decision here. I'll go with the initial analysis that compound 2 has optical isomerism, and compound 4 doesn't. So, let me check which options include only 2.

Looking at the options, option D includes 1 and 2. So, if 1 also has optical isomerism, then D is correct.

But I'm not certain about compound 1.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possibility of a chiral center in compound 1. If the molecule has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

But a chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. In compound 1, each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The central carbon in the biphenyl structure is attached to two benzene rings, but that's a single bond. So, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, and perhaps other groups.

Wait, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond between C1 and C1'. So, each C1 is attached to the other ring. So, the central bond is a single bond, and each C1 is attached to two other substituents on their respective rings.

So, the substituents on each benzene ring (2 and 6 positions) would have an impact on the symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of two nitro groups and two carboxylate groups in symmetric positions causes the molecule to have a plane of symmetry.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll make an educated guess that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, making option D the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and contains a carbon atom (or another element) bonded to four distinct groups.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. The substituents are arranged symmetrically on the biphenyl structure. The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This creates a chiral center, making the molecule capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-isomer of the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, as the substituents on each double-bonded carbon are identical. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Among the four compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds are chiral, so they do not exhibit optical isomerism.
