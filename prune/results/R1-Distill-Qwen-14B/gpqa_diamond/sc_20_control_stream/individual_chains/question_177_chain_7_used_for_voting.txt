Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. I think this is from Wien's Law. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then both stars must have the same temperature. That's an important point.

The question is about their luminosities. The options are about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So I need to find L1/L2.

I know the formula for the luminosity of a star (assuming it radiates as a black body) is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same T, because their peak wavelengths are the same, the ratio of their luminosities will be (R1² / R2²) times (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T part cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Plugging that into the ratio, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. Looking at the options, option A is 2.25. But wait, the options include 2.23 and others. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh! I think this is about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths. But earlier, the peak wavelengths were measured as the same. So maybe the actual emitted peak wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same.

Wait, how does that affect things? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths get shifted. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted, making its observed peak wavelength shorter. But the measured peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the actual temperatures of the stars are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear to have the same observed wavelength.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the rest frame of each star. Let's see. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the emitted wavelength λ_rest by the Doppler formula. For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is approximately λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (but I think it's actually (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For recessional velocity v, z is approx v/c. But in this case, Star_1 has v_r =0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has v_r =700 km/s. Let's assume that the velocity is in the direction away from us (since it's 700 km/s, but the sign matters). Wait, no, wait: the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s away from us, because radial velocity is positive when moving away. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 would be longer than its emitted peak wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if Star_1's λ_max is λ, then Star_2's emitted λ_max would be λ' such that when Doppler shifted, it also becomes λ.

Oh, that changes things. So the actual temperatures of the stars would be different. Because if their observed λ_max are the same, but Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max must be shorter (since it's moving away, λ increases, so to have the same observed λ, the emitted must be shorter. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards). So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700e3 / c). But we're told that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Star_1's v_r is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 (1 + 700e3 / c).

Wait, but wait. Let me get the exact formula. The Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And for small velocities, z ≈ v_r / c. So for Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. So z = 700e3 m/s / (3e8 m/s) = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333. So 1+z ≈ 1.02333.

So λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1.02333).

But λ_obs2 = λ_obs1, which is the same as λ_emit1 because Star_1 isn't moving. So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / 1.02333.

Wait, but from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T. So λ_emit1 = b / T1, and λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So substituting, λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / 1.02333 → (b/T2) = (b/T1) / 1.02333 → T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

So T2 is higher than T1? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the observed λ is longer. So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c). Since Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive. So λ_obs2 is longer than λ_emit2.

But the problem says that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So λ_emit1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 (1 + v_r/c). So, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c). So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r/c).

But since λ_emit = b / T, then T = b / λ_emit. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, that can't be correct. Wait, let's redo the substitution.

From λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 (1 + v_r/c). Because λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c).

But λ_emit1 = b / T1 and λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c) → T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v_r/c). Hmm, but Star_2 is moving away, which would make its observed wavelength longer, but its actual emitted wavelength is shorter, which implies a higher temperature (since λ_emit is smaller, T is higher).

Wait, but if a star is moving away, we see longer wavelengths, so the star's actual emission is at shorter wavelengths (hence higher T), but when it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So yeah, if Star_2 is moving away, and the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1, then its emitted wavelength is shorter, so higher T.

So T2 = T1 × (1 + v_r/c).

Wait a second, v_r is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v_r/c). v_r = 700,000 m/s. c is about 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333. So 1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333.

So T2 = T1 × 1.023333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but in the initial assumption, I thought that the temperatures are the same because the observed wavelengths are the same. That's where I went wrong. Because the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual (emitted) wavelengths are different due to Doppler shift. So the temperatures are different.

So now, the luminosity depends on both R and T. Let me get the correct ratio.

So L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 =1.5.

T2 = T1 × 1.023333. So T1/T2 = 1 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977.

Wait, but wait: T2 = T1 × (1 + v_r/c). So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c) → T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r/c) ≈ 0.977.

Wait, but in L1/L2, T1 is in the numerator and T2 in the denominator. So (T1^4) / (T2^4) = (T1/T2)^4 = (1/(1.023333))^4.

So let's plug in the numbers.

R_ratio = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T_ratio = (T1 / T2)^4 = (1/(1.023333))^4.

Compute 1.023333^4. Let's compute 1.023333^2 first: 1.023333^2 ≈ around 1.0474 (since 0.02333 is roughly 2.333% → (1.02333)^2 ≈ 1.0474). Then square that: 1.0474^2 ≈ 1.096. So 1/1.096 ≈ 0.912.

Wait, that's an approximation, but perhaps more accurately, let's compute it.

Let me compute 1.023333:

v_r =700,000 m/s.

v_r/c = 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333333...

So 1 + v_r/c = 1.023333333.

Compute (1.023333333)^4.

Let me compute step by step.

First, compute (1.023333333)^2:

1.023333333 * 1.023333333.

Let me compute this:

= (1 + 0.023333333)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.023333333) + (0.023333333)^2

= 1 + 0.046666666 + ~0.000544444

≈ 1.04721111.

Then, (1.04721111)^2.

Again, let's compute:

1.04721111^2 = ?

Well, 1.0472^2.

Let me compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

= (1 + 0.0472)^2.

= 1 + 2 * 0.0472 + (0.0472)^2.

= 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784.

= 1.09662784.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈1.09662784.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (1 / 1.023333)^4 = 1/(1.09662784) ≈ 0.9119.

So L1/L2 = (R_ratio) * (T_ratio) = 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.9119 = let's compute.

2 * 0.9119 = 1.8238.

0.25 * 0.9119 = 0.227975.

Adding together: 1.8238 + 0.227975 = approximately 2.0518.

Wait, that's about 2.05. But none of the options are near 2.05. The options are like 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ratio. Let me re-express.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c) → T1 = T2 / 1.023333333 → T1/T2 = 1/1.023333333 ≈ 0.977.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ ?

Calculating 0.977^4.

0.977^2 = (1 - 0.023)^2 = 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 ≈ 0.954529.

Then square that: (0.954529)^2 ≈ ?

0.9545^2 = (approx 0.9545 * 0.9545 )

Let me compute:

0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.

0.9 * 0.0545 = ~0.04905.

0.0545 * 0.9 = another 0.04905.

0.0545 * 0.0545 ≈ ~0.00297.

Adding these:

0.81 + 0.04905 + 0.04905 = 0.9081, plus 0.00297 → 0.91107.

Wait, wait, no, that approach is incorrect. Because 0.9545 is a single number. Let me compute 0.9545 * 0.9545.

What's 9545 * 9545? Well, perhaps it's easier to compute 9545^2.

But perhaps an approximate method:

(9500 + 45)^2 = 9500² + 2*9500*45 +45².

9500² = (9.5e3)^2 =90.25e6.

2*9500*45 = 2 * 427,500 = 855,000 → 8.55e5.

45² = 2025.

Total: 90,250,000 + 855,000 = 91,105,000 + 2025 = 91,107,025.

So 0.9545^2 is 0.9545 * 0.9545 = (9545/10000)^2 = (91,107,025)/(1e8) ) = 0.91107025.

So (0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.91107.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.91107 = let me compute that.

2 * 0.91107 = 1.82214.

0.25 * 0.91107 = 0.2277675.

Adding together: 1.82214 + 0.2277675 = 2.05, approximately.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. None of the options are close to 2.05. The options given are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for Doppler shift. Let me double-check.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

But for the temperature, using Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So, if Star_2 is moving away with radial velocity v, then its observed λ_obs is λ_emit * (1 + v/c).

But λ_obs for both stars is the same. So:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r/c).

And since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have:

λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r/c).

But λ_emit1 = b / T1.

λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So, substituting:

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v_r/c).

Divide both sides by b:

1/T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v_r/c) )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v_r/c) ≈ 1.023333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

Wait, but that means T2 > T1. So when we compute the luminosity, which depends on T^4, so T2 is larger, so L2 would be larger. But the question is about L1 / L2.

Wait, let me recast the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

R1/R2 =1.5 → (1.5)^2 =2.25.

T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r/c) = 1/(1.023333) ≈0.9771.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9771)^4.

Wait, let me compute 0.9771^4.

Compute 0.977^2 first.

0.977 * 0.977 → approximately 0.954529.

Wait, same as before. Then 0.954529 squared is about 0.91107.

So (0.9771)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.25 *0.91107.

Let me calculate 2.25 *0.91107:

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.01107 = approx 0.02506.

So total ≈2.025 +0.02506= 2.05.

But wait, the options don't include 2.05. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the luminosities considering the Doppler shift. But wait, the luminosity calculation assumes the star's actual parameters, not the observed ones. Because the star emits with its own T and R, regardless of motion. The observed flux would be affected by Doppler, but luminosity is an intrinsic property.

Wait, but in this question, L is computed as if the star is a black body with its own R and T. So the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but the actual R and T are what determine the luminosity.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies. So for each star, they calculate L based on their own R and T.

So, considering that, the problem is:

We have Star_1 and Star_2.

Star_1: R1 =1.5 R2, T1 = T1.

Star_2: R2, T2.

But from the observed λ_max (which is same for both), we have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since Star_1 is not moving).

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 (1 + v_r/c).

So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 (1 + v_r/c).

But λ_emit = b / T. So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c).

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c )^{-1}.

Wait, wait, no. Let's see:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c).

Since λ_emit1 = b/T1, and λ_emit2 =b/T2 → substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c ).

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

→ T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c )

So T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

So T2 is higher than T1.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ T2 * 0.9771.

So when computing L1 and L2:

L1 =4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2=4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

As before.

So R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r/c) ≈ 0.9771.

So (0.9771)^4 ≈0.91107.

So 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈2.05.

But the options are 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Hmm. So why isn't 2.05 among the options? Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is considered for the observed flux, but the luminosity calculation is based on the observed parameters, not the intrinsic ones. No, the question says they computed the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies. So the R and T are their intrinsic values.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, when the star is moving, do we need to consider any Doppler effect on the flux? Or is the flux measured as the star emits, not the observed one?

Hmm, I think the luminosity is an intrinsic property, so the calculation of L depends on R and T of the star itself. The observed flux would be affected by distance and Doppler, but in this problem, the question is about the intrinsic luminosity as computed by the astronomers.

Wait, but the question states that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. But for a star, the maximum emission is in the rest frame. So if the star is moving, the observed maximum would shift, but the star's own maximum is at λ_emit = b/T.

So the astronomers must have accounted for the Doppler shift when determining the stars' temperatures. Because to find T, you can't just take the observed λ_max; you have to correct for any Doppler shift.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if a star is moving toward or away from us, the observed λ_max is not the same as the emitted λ_max. So to get the correct T, you have to correct for the Doppler shift.

So the astronomers would measure the observed λ_max, and knowing the radial velocity, correct for it to find the emitted λ_max, and then compute T using Wien's law.

So in this problem, when the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, that refers to the observed λ_max, not the emitted. Therefore, the emitted λ_max would be different for each star, leading to different T.

So, from the observed λ_max (λ_obs), which is same for both stars, and knowing the radial velocity, the astronomers would compute the emitted λ_max and thus the temperature.

So, for Star_1, v_r1=0 km/s → λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

For Star_2, v_r2=700 km/s → λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 / (1 + 700e3/c).

So, indeed, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, λ_emit = b / T → T = b / λ_emit.

So, for Star_1: T1 = b / λ_emit1.

For Star_2: T2 = b / λ_emit2.

But λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, no, because Star_2 is moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So, λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / ( λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r2/c) ) ) = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = T1 × (1 + 700e3/(3e5)).

Wait, wait, let me compute this correctly. v_r2 is 700 km/s =7e5 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, 7e5 /3e8 =7/(3e3) → 7/3000 ≈0.002333.

So 1 + v_r2/c = 1.002333.

Wait, no, wait. No, 7e5 /3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300)≈0.023333. So 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333.

Ah, right, earlier mistake. So T2 = T1 × 1.023333.

So T2 is higher than T1.

So now, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) × ( (T1/T2)^4 )

= (1.5)^2 × (1/(1.023333))^4.

Which is 2.25 × (approx 0.91107) ≈2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value more accurately.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 precisely.

(1.023333)^2 = 1.023333 *1.023333.

Let me compute this exactly.

1.023333 * 1.023333.

= (1 + 0.023333)^2.

= 1^2 + 2 *1 * 0.023333 + (0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 0.0466666 + (0.00054444).

=1.047210.

Now, compute (1.047210)^2.

=1.047210 *1.047210.

Let me compute this as:

1.047210 ×1.047210.

We can write this as:

(1 + 0.047210) × (1 + 0.047210).

= 1 + 2*(0.047210) + (0.047210)^2.

=1 + 0.09442 + (0.002228).

= 1.096648.

So (1.023333)^4 =1.096648.

So (1/(1.023333))^4 =1/1.096648≈0.9119.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 *0.9119 = let me compute this precisely.

2.25 × 0.9119.

= (2 ×0.9119) + (0.25 ×0.9119).

=1.8238 + 0.227975 =2.051775.

Approximately 2.0518.

But the options are all in the 2.2-2.35 range. So where am I wrong?

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but the luminosity calculation uses the observed parameters, not the intrinsic ones. Wait, no, the question says: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity..." So the luminosity is based on the star's intrinsic R and T, which would be their actual values, not the observed. So perhaps the Doppler shift affects how the astronomers determine T.

Wait, because if the star is moving, the observed spectrum is Doppler shifted, so to get the actual T, you have to correct the observed λ_max by the Doppler shift.

So, if the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but their actual emitted wavelengths are different because of their velocities, then their actual Ts are different.

So, for Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

For Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r2/c).

So, T1 =b / λ_emit1.

T2 =b / λ_emit2 = b * (1 + v_r2/c) / λ_emit1 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = T1 × (1 + v_r2/c) = T1 × 1.023333.

So, the T for Star_2 is higher.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 )/( R2² T2^4 )= ( (1.5)^2 ) × ( (T1)/(T1 ×1.023333) )^4.

= 2.25 × (1/1.023333)^4.

Which is 2.25 × (approx 0.9119) =2.0518.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same for mass. But mass might not directly affect luminosity for main-sequence stars, but in this problem, it's given as a factor, but perhaps it's a red herring. Since the problem is about blackbody luminosity, which depends on R and T, mass isn't directly relevant unless it affects T.

Wait, but in reality, more massive stars are hotter, but perhaps in this problem, it's given that the mass is 1.5 times, but perhaps that's intended to be a distractor, as the problem only requires R and T for luminosity.

So I think the previous approach is correct, but the answer I get (approx 2.05) isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute (1.023333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute (1.023333333)^4 precisely.

Compute 1.023333333^2:

1.023333333 ×1.023333333.

Let me compute digit by digit.

1.023333333 × 1.023333333.

The exact value:

= 1.047210888.

Then, square that:

1.047210888^2.

Compute 1.047210888 × 1.047210888.

Break it down:

1.047210888 ×1.047210888.

= (1 + 0.047210888 ) × (1 + 0.047210888 )

= 1 + 2*(0.047210888) + (0.047210888)^2.

Compute each term:

2*0.047210888 = 0.094421776.

(0.047210888)^2 = 0.047210888 ×0.047210888.

Let me compute this:

0.047210888 ×0.047210888.

= (0.04)^2 + ... Hmm, perhaps it's easier to note that 0.047210888 is approximately 0.047210888.

0.047210888 × 0.047210888 ≈ (47.210888e-3)^2 = (47.210888)^2e-6.

47.210888^2 = approx 2228. (since 47^2=2209, 48^2=2304).

So 47.210888^2 ≈ (47 +0.210888)^2 =47² + 2*47*0.210888 + (0.210888)^2 = 2209 + 2*47*0.210888 + ~0.04447.

2 *47 =94; 94 * 0.210888 ≈ 19.817.

So 2209 +19.817= 2228.817, plus 0.04447 → ~2228.861.

So 47.210888^2 = approx 2228.861 → 2228.861e-6 = 0.002228861.

So putting it all together:

1.047210888^2 ≈ 1 + 0.094421776 + 0.002228861 = 1.096650637.

So (1.023333333)^4 =1.096650637.

So 1/(1.023333333)^4 = 1/1.096650637 ≈0.9119.

So L1/L2=2.25 * 0.9119= ~2.0518.

But the options don't have 2.05.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the Doppler shift. Let me double-check.

Wait, for Star_2, which is moving away, the observed λ is longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

But to find the emitted λ, you would do λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v_r/c).

So λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c).

Which implies that λ_emit1 is longer than λ_emit2, which implies that T1 is lower than T2.

Because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So T1 = b/λ_emit1.

T2 =b/λ_emit2.

So T1 = (b/λ_emit2) * (1 +v_r/c)^{-1} = T2 * (1 +v_r/c)^{-1}.

So T1 = T2 / (1 +v_r/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 +v_r/c).

Ah, wait, no, wait. Let me re-derive this.

λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 +v_r/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 / (1 +v_r/c).

So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 / (1 +v_r/c).

But λ_emit = b/T → T = b/λ_emit.

So T1 = b/λ_emit1 → T1 = b/(λ_emit2/(1 +v_r/c)) ) → T1 = (b * (1 +v_r/c)) / λ_emit2.

But T2 = b/λ_emit2 → T1 = (1 +v_r/c ) * T2.

So T1 = T2 * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, that can't be, because if Star_2 has a higher T, then its emitted λ is shorter. But since Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ is longer. So if λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and Star_2's λ_emit is shorter, then T2 must be higher.

So yes, T1 = T2 * (1 +v_r/c ). No, wait, no. Wait, because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ is longer, but the emitted λ is shorter (so T is higher). So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but according to the equation, T1 = (1 +v_r/c ) * T2. That would imply T1 is larger than T2, which contradicts the expectation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inversion.

Let me make it step by step.

For Star_1: it's not moving, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

For Star_2: moving away with velocity v_r2=700 km/s.

So λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r2/c).

But T is proportional to 1/λ_emit.

So T1 = b/λ_emit1.

T2 = b/λ_emit2 = b * (1 +v_r2/c)/λ_emit1 = (1 +v_r2/c) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 +v_r2/c).

So T2 is higher than T1.

So when we compute L1 and L2:

L1 =4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 =4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2= (R1² T1^4 )/( R2² T2^4 ) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 ).

Since R1=1.5 R2, R1/R2=1.5 → (1.5)^2=2.25.

T1/T2 = 1/(1 +v_r2/c) = 1/(1.023333)≈0.9771.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9771)^4≈0.9119.

Thus, L1/L2=2.25 * 0.9119≈2.05.

But the options don't match that. So perhaps the problem is that I've assumed that the observed λ_max is same, but in reality, when you correct for Doppler shift, the effective T is different.

Wait, perhaps when the astronomers calculate the luminosity, they use the observed T, which is corrected for Doppler shift. So for each star, they compute T from the observed λ_max and their velocity.

Because without correcting for velocity, the observed λ_max would give T_obs = b/λ_obs, but the actual temperature is T_actual = T_obs / (1 +v_r/c), or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how the astronomers determine T. If the star is moving away, the observed peak wavelength is longer, so without knowing the velocity, they would calculate a lower temperature. But since they know the velocity, they can correct for it.

So for Star_2, the observed λ_obs2 is λ_emit2 * (1 +v_r2/c).

So the astronomers, knowing the velocity, compute T2 as b/λ_emit2, which is T2 = T_obs2 / (1 +v_r2/c).

Wait, but how does that fit into the problem? Let me rephrase.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. That is, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same.

But the astronomers would compute the actual T for each star by correcting for their velocities.

So for Star_1:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 → T1= b/λ_emit1.

For Star_2:

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 +v_r2/c) → λ_emit2 = λ_obs2/(1 +v_r2/c).

So T2 = b/λ_emit2 = b * (1 +v_r2/c)/λ_obs2.

But λ_obs1=λ_obs2 → λ_obs2=λ_obs1.

So T2 = (1+v_r2/c) * (b/λ_obs1) )= (1 +v_r2/c) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 +v_r2/c) = T1 *1.023333.

Thus, the actual T of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1.

So the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2= (R1^2 T1^4)/(R2^2 T2^4) = ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (T1)/(T1 *1.023333) )^4 )= 2.25 * (1/1.096648 ) ≈2.25 *0.9119 ≈2.05.

Hmm, but again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, which is what the luminosity calculation is based on. But no, the problem says they compute the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies, which would depend on their intrinsic R and T.

I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the ratio is about 2.05, but the options are around 2.23 to 2.35. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should include the Doppler shift in the calculation of the observed flux, which affects the measured luminosity. But no, the question states that the luminosity is calculated based on the star being a black body, which depends on R and T. The observed flux would be different, but the luminosity is intrinsic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the observed wavelengths are the same, but in reality, the intrinsic λ_max for each star are different. So the corrected temperatures are different, leading to different L.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the luminosity as observed, but the question says they computed the luminosity assuming black body, which is intrinsic.

So I'm confident my approach is correct, but the answer is not among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1.023333333)^4 exactly using a calculator approach.

1.023333333^4.

Compute step by step:

1.023333333^2 = 1.047210888.

Then, 1.047210888^2.

Compute 1.047210888 × 1.047210888:

= (1.047210888)^2.

Let me compute this:

= 1.047210888 × 1.047210888.

I'll compute this as:

= (1 + 0.047210888) × (1 + 0.047210888).

= 1 + 2*(0.047210888) + (0.047210888)^2.

= 1 + 0.094421776 + 0.002228856.

=1.096650632.

So (1.023333333)^4 =1.096650632.

So 1/(1.023333333)^4 = 1/1.096650632 ≈0.9119.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 *0.9119 =2.0518.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is that T2 is lower than T1?

Wait, perhaps I inverted the Doppler shift.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer. So λ_obs2 =λ_emit2 × (1 +v_r2/c).

But if the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, λ_obs1 =λ_obs2.

So, λ_emit1 =λ_obs1.

λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 +v_r2/c) = λ_emit1 / (1 +v_r2/c).

Which means λ_emit2 is shorter than λ_emit1, so T2 is higher than T1.

So, T2 = (1 +v_r2/c ) * T1.

Which brings us back to the same ratio.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's another factor here. Since the stars are moving, their flux would be Doppler shifted. But the problem is about luminosity, not observed flux.

Wait, but perhaps the observed flux is F = L/(4π d²), where d is distance. But if the stars are moving, the observed flux would change. However, the problem doesn't mention distance, so I think this is not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of L is based on the observed flux, but that's not what the question says.

I'm stuck. My calculation leads me to 2.05, but the options don't have that. The only option close to 2.05 is option D) ~2.23, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift. Let me compute 700 km/s over the speed of light correctly.

v_r2 =700,000 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v_r2/c =700e3 /3e8 =7e5 /3e8 =7/(3e3) =7/3000 ≈0.002333.

Wait, wait! Oh no! I think I made a mistake here. I thought 7e5 m/s over 3e8 m/s is 0.023333, but that's wrong.

Wait, 700,000 m/s is 7e5.

3e8 is 3 *1e8 =300,000,000.

700,000 /300,000,000 = 7/(300) =0.02333333.

Wait, no, wait: 7e5 /3e8 =7/(3e3) → 7/3000=0.0023333333.

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute 7e5 /3e8.

7e5 is 700,000.

3e8 is 300,000,000.

700,000 /300,000,000 = 0.0023333333333. So 0.233333333% of c.

Ah! So v_r2/c =0.00233333333.

So 1 + v_r2/c =1.0023333333.

Earlier, I thought it was 0.02333333, but no, it's 0.00233333.

Ah! That's the mistake. I've been using 0.02333333 instead of 0.002333333333.

So that changes everything.

So, redo the calculations with v_r2/c =0.00233333333.

So, 1 + v_r2/c =1.0023333333.

So, T2 = T1 * (1.0023333333).

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (1/1.0023333333)^4.

Compute (1.0023333333)^4.

Compute step by step:

(1.0023333333)^2 = 1.0046666666.

Then, (1.0046666666)^2 = ?

Compute 1.0046666666 × 1.0046666666.

Approximately:

= (1 + 0.0046666666)^2.

=1 + 2*(0.0046666666) + (0.0046666666)^2.

=1 + 0.0093333332 + 0.0000217777.

≈1.0093551109.

So (1.0023333333)^4 ≈1.0093551109.

So 1/(1.0023333333)^4 ≈1/1.0093551109 ≈0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2/R2^2) × (T1^4/T2^4) = (2.25) × (0.9907) ≈2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of the luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)). Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\)) and the Doppler shift formula (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)\)), we relate the emitted wavelengths to the observed wavelengths.

For Star_1 (not moving, \(v_{r1} = 0\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,1}}
\]

For Star_2 (moving away at \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\), we get:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}
\]

The radial velocity is \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s}\), and the speed of light is \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \frac{7 \times 10^5}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.002333
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c} = 1.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4
\]

Using approximations:

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

**Answer: D**
