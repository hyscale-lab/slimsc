Alright, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but let's try to think through it.

Okay, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. And we're supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 KeV (band 2), so flux1 over flux2.

Wait, first, let me recall what the pp-III branch is. I remember the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. There are different branches, like the pp-I, II, III. The pp-III branch produces different particles, right? Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a helium-3 nucleus (He-3) into helium-4 (He-4), a proton (H-1), and a positron. This process emits neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos (ν_e).

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? So the pp-III is a source of neutrinos. So stopping it would reduce the number of neutrinos emitted from that process.

But wait, what about the other branches? The question states that all other reactions remained as they were. So the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, along with whatever else contributes to neutrinos.

Wait, another thought: the pp-III branch is one of the steps in the proton-proton chain. The main proton-proton chain starts with two protons fusing into deuterium, and then another proton fusing to helium-3. Then, the helium-3 can either combine with another helium-3 via the pp-III branch to make He-4, or perhaps via the CNO cycle? Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process altogether, more prominent in heavier stars.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos. The main neutrinos from the Sun come from the pp-III branch, specifically the so-called "pep" (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which is part of the pp-I branch. Or wait, am I mixing this up? Let me think again.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is the He-3 + He-3 -> He-4 + 2 protons + energy, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-I branch is the main one, like two protons fusing to deuterium, then another proton fusing to He-3, and then He-3 fuses with another He-3 via the pp-II or pp-III branch.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The proton-proton chain has several steps. The initial step is two protons (H-1) fusing to deuterium (D), emitting a positron and a neutrino (this is the pep reaction, part of the pp-I branch, I think). Then, the deuterium fuses with another H-1 to form He-3, releasing some energy. The He-3 can then either combine with another He-3 via the pp-III branch to form He-4, a proton, and a positron and neutrino, or perhaps other reactions. Alternatively, the He-3 can interact with a He-4 via the pp-II branch to form something else.

Wait, more accurately, the main pp chain has two main branches: the majority of the reactions go through the pp-I branch, which involves the initial steps, and then the pp-III branch is for the triple-alpha process, but no, wait, that's for heavier elements. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the neutrino production. The question states that the pp-III branch has stopped. So the pp-III branch must be a major source of neutrinos. Without it, the flux of those neutrinos would drop.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the Sun's core due to these fusion reactions. The primary sources are the pep reaction and the main pp chain, which includes the pp-III branch. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino flux from that source would stop, but other sources (like the pep reaction) would continue.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands. So, the energy bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I'm guessing that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have certain energy ranges, and maybe the other sources (like the pep reaction) have different energy ranges.

Wait, the pep reaction (part of the pp-I branch) emits a neutrino with an energy of about 0.3 MeV (300 keV). Then, in the main pp chain, when He-3 combines via pp-III, it emits a neutrino as well, but higher energy perhaps? Or maybe the same? Or maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy than those from the pep reaction.

Wait, I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch (He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + ...) are higher energy than those from the pep reaction. Because the binding energy differences are larger, so more energy is released, leading to higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV range) would be affected more than the lower ones (like 700-800 keV). Because the higher-energy ones are mostly from the pp-III branch, which has stopped.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the flux in band 1 (700-800) over band 2 (800-900). So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, which produces more higher-energy neutrinos, then the flux in band 2 would drop significantly, while band 1 might drop less if its neutrinos come from other sources.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So, the other neutrino sources (like the pep reaction) are still active. So, the neutrinos from the pep reaction (lower energy) are still being produced, but the higher-energy ones (from pp-III) are not.

So, what's the energy distribution? Let's think: the pep reaction neutrinos are around 0.3 MeV (300 keV), so band 1 (700-800) is higher than that. The pp-III branch neutrinos are higher, perhaps around 1.4 MeV (1400 keV), but that's higher than band 2. Wait, no, I'm not certain about the exact energies.

Wait, perhaps the main neutrino emission from the pp-III branch is at higher energies. So, the question is about the ratio of the flux in two bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let's model this.

If the pp-III branch neutrinos contribute more to the higher-energy bands (like 800-900 keV) than the lower ones, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than in band 1.

So, normal situation: band 1 (700-800) has some flux from the pp-III branch, and perhaps some from other sources. Band 2 (800-900) has more from pp-III.

After pp-III stops: the flux in band 2 (which was high) drops, because it was mainly from pp-III. The flux in band 1, which might have had less from pp-III, drops less or maybe doesn't drop much if it's dominated by other sources.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remained as they are. So, the other neutrino sources (like the pep reaction) continue. So, the flux in band 1 and band 2 would depend on whether their neutrinos come from the pp-III branch or other sources.

Assuming that the pp-III branch is a major source of higher-energy neutrinos, then band 2's flux would be much lower than band 1's after the pp-III stops.

Wait, but before the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would be higher than band 1. After stopping, band 2's flux drops, so the ratio (flux1/flux2) would increase.

For example, if before stopping, the flux in band 2 was, say, 10 times that of band 1, then the ratio (band1/band2) would be 0.1. If pp-III stops, and band 2's flux drops to maybe the same as band1's, then the ratio would be 1. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes a significant portion of the higher-energy neutrinos. So, if it stops, the higher-energy flux (band2) would drop a lot compared to the lower-energy (band1).

Wait, another angle: the number of neutrinos emitted in each reaction. The pp-III branch produces a lot of neutrinos. So, before the stop, band2 (800-900) would have a large flux due to pp-III. After the stop, band2's flux drops, but band1's (700-800) might have a smaller contribution from pp-III, so their flux doesn't drop as much.

Thus, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would increase because flux2 decreased more than flux1.

But what's the original flux ratio? Let's think about the typical neutrino energy spectrum. Lower-energy neutrinos (like 300 keV) are from the pep reaction. Higher-energy ones (like 1-10 MeV) are from the main pp chain, maybe the pp-III branch.

Wait, another point: the Sun emits more low-energy neutrinos than high-energy ones because the main source (pep) produces lower-energy ones and is more copious. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos but perhaps is a less voluminous source.

But wait, the pp-III may emit fewer neutrinos but each at higher energy. So, the number of neutrinos from the pp-III would be lower than the pep, but the neutrinos are higher energy.

But in terms of flux in a given energy band, let's say before the pp-III stops, band2 (800-900) is getting neutrinos mostly from pp-III. Band1 (700-800) might have a mix of lower-energy neutrinos from pep and perhaps some from pp-III.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, so band1 (700-800) has only a small fraction from pp-III, and band2 has a larger fraction. So, when pp-III stops, band2 flux drops more than band1.

So, if before, about half of band2's flux was from pp-III, then after stopping, that part would drop to zero. So band2's flux would be halved, while band1's might drop only a little or not at all.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch stopped, and that the rest of the reactions are as before. So, the pep reaction is still active, producing its 300 keV neutrinos, which are lower than 700 keV, so they don't contribute to band1 or band2.

Wait, no, the pep reaction emits neutrinos at about 0.3 MeV (300 keV), which are below band1's lower limit of 700 keV. So, those neutrinos are in lower energy ranges and wouldn't contribute to either band1 or band2.

So, the neutrinos in band1 and band2 must come from the main pp chain, perhaps the pp-III branch. So, if the pp-III branch stops, then all neutrinos above a certain energy are gone.

Wait, but the main source of neutrinos from the Sun is the pep reaction, which is part of the pp-I branch. Then, the pp-III branch is another part of the pp chain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact sources. Let me try to recall. The main source of solar neutrinos is the pep reaction, which is part of the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch is a secondary process that also emits neutrinos, but maybe not as many as the pep reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor source compared to the main pp chain's other steps. Or is it the major source? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

I think the majority of the Sun's neutrinos come from the pep reaction, which is part of the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is another part of the same chain, perhaps contributing a smaller number of neutrinos but at higher energies.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in band2) would drop, but the lower-energy ones (band1) would still be there, albeit perhaps at lower flux if band1 is in a range where some neutrinos come from pp-III.

Wait, but band1 is 700-800 keV. If the pp-III branch produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV (1400 keV), then the neutrinos in band2 (800-900) might have some from the pp-III branch. But the band1 may not. Because 700 keV is lower than 1.4 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch neutrinos are higher than 1 MeV, which is 1000 keV. So, the 800-900 keV band (band2) is just below that, so maybe only a small part of the pp-III neutrinos would fall into band2, perhaps none? Or perhaps I'm getting the energies wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the range of around 1.4 MeV, which is 1400 keV. So, band1 is 700-800 keV, which is lower than that. So, the neutrinos from the pp-III would be in higher energy bands than band2, which is 800-900. So, do pp-III neutrinos contribute to band2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the neutrino energies wrong. Let me think. The pep reaction emits about 0.3 MeV. The main pp chain, perhaps via the pp-III branch, emits higher energy neutrinos, like around 1.4 MeV. So, in that case, the 800-900 keV band is below that. Therefore, the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to band2, but to higher bands.

Wait, but the question only asks about bands 700-800 and 800-900. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, then they don't fall into either band. Therefore, the flux in both bands would be unchanged? But that can't be right because the question implies that the flux ratio changes.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in a lower energy range. Let me think about the actual neutrino energies from the Sun.

Wait, I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos are from the pep reaction, which has an energy around 0.3 MeV. Then, the main pp chain produces higher-energy neutrinos, but perhaps not as many. So, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have energies in the range of 1-10 MeV.

Wait, but 1 MeV is 1000 keV. So, the 800-900 keV band is just below that. So, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be in higher energy bands than 800-900 keV. Therefore, the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to either band1 or band2.

Wait, that can't be, because the question states that the pp-III branch stops, which would affect the neutrino flux. If the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, then bands 1 and 2 would not be affected. But the question is about these two bands, so perhaps I'm missing some other aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the 0.5 MeV range, which would make them part of the 500-800 keV band, which is band1. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, then stopping them would reduce band1's flux more than band2's.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact neutrino energies from the pp-III branch. I might need to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing the majority of the higher-energy neutrinos, which fall into band2 (800-900 keV). So, if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band2 would drop significantly, while band1 might drop less.

Alternatively, the pp-III branch is the only source for the higher-energy neutrinos. So, after stopping, band2's flux would drop to almost zero, while band1's flux remains the same.

In that case, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would become much larger than 1. Because flux2 is almost zero, but flux1 is the same as before.

Wait, but that can't be. Because when pp-III stops, both band1 and band2 would be affected if they have contributions from pp-III. But if band2's flux is entirely from pp-III, then flux2 would drop to zero, making the ratio approach infinity. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the neutrinos. So, maybe the pp-III neutrinos have energies around 1.4 MeV, which is 1400 keV. So, any neutrinos from the pp-III branch would contribute to bands higher than 800-900 keV. Therefore, bands 1 and 2 (700-800 and 800-900 keV) would not be affected by the pp-III stopping.

But then, why does the question say that the flux ratio would change? It must affect the flux in these bands.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the pp-III branch with another process. Maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 0.8 MeV range, which would fall into band1 (700-800) and band2 (800-900) if they're higher.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV. So, let's think: if the pp-III neutrinos are at 0.8 MeV (800 keV), then they would fall into band1 (700-800) when their energy is just below 800, and into band2 if they're above 800.

Wait, but 0.8 MeV is 800 keV. So, a neutrino with exactly 800 keV is at the upper edge of band1 and the lower edge of band2.

But this depends on the exact energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos. If the neutrinos from pp-III have a range of energies, some fall into band1 and some into band2.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos have energies from, say, 0.7 to 0.9 MeV, then they would contribute to both bands. So, if the pp-III branch stops, both bands would lose some flux.

But the question is, which band loses more? If the neutrinos from pp-III are spread between 700 and 900 keV, then the flux in both bands would decrease, but perhaps band2 (800-900) has more neutrinos from pp-III.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then band2's flux would be more affected than band1.

Alternatively, maybe the majority of pp-III neutrinos are in band2, so stopping the branch would reduce band2 flux more than band1.

In that case, the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase. Because if previously, flux2 was higher than flux1, then after the pp-III stops, flux2 decreases more, so the ratio (flux1/flux2) becomes larger.

Assuming that before the pp-III stopped, band2's flux was, say, 10 times band1's, then the ratio would be 0.1. After stopping, if band2's flux drops to the same as band1, the ratio becomes 1.

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band1 and band2 are dominated by different sources. Band1 (700-800) might have its flux from another process (like the pep reaction) that's not affected, while band2 (800-900) is mostly from the pp-III, which stops.

In this case, after the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to nearly zero, while band1's remains the same. So, the ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2) ≈ band1_flux / 0, which is infinity. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the options don't include large numbers except option A (10). So, perhaps the ratio is 10, meaning flux1 is 10 times flux2.

Alternatively, perhaps before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band2 was 10 times that of band1. So, the flux1/flux2 ratio was 0.1. After stopping, if band2's flux drops to zero, flux1/flux2 approaches infinity, but that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, so their contribution is only to band2. Therefore, before stopping, band2's flux was higher. So, the ratio (flux1/flux2) was less than 1, perhaps 0.1. After stopping, the pp-III neutrinos are gone, so band2's flux drops, but band1's flux remains the same.

Wait, but if band1's flux is from other sources (like the pep reaction, which produces lower-energy neutrinos, not in band1), then band1's flux would remain the same, and band2's would drop.

So, if before, band1's flux was F1 and band2's was F2, and F1 = F2 * 0.1, then the ratio was 0.1. After stopping pp-III, band2's flux would drop to its other sources. But wait, are there other sources for band2's neutrinos?

Alternatively, perhaps band2's neutrinos come mostly from the pp-III, and band1's neutrinos come from other sources.

If that's the case, then before the stop, band2's flux was higher than band1's. Let's say F2 = 10 F1. So, the ratio is 0.1. After stopping, band2's flux becomes whatever comes from other sources. If the other sources are negligible, then F2 becomes zero. But that's not realistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1. So, the flux in band2 is dominated by pp-III, but band1 has some other sources.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the possible options.

The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

Assuming that the pp-III branch contributed more to band2 than band1, then when it stops, the flux in band2 would drop more than in band1.

Thus, the ratio (flux1 / flux2) would be higher than before. So, if before the ratio was 0.1, after stopping, if band2's flux drops a lot, the ratio could become 1, or even 10.

Wait, but which option is the case? Let me think about the energy bands.

Suppose pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range. Then, band2's neutrinos are primarily from pp-III. So, if pp-III stops, band2's flux drops.

Band1's neutrinos, 700-800, may come from other sources, maybe the main pp chain at lower energies or perhaps the CNO cycle, but I thought the CNO cycle is more prominent in higher mass stars. The Sun's main process is the proton-proton chain, so it's unlikely.

Assuming that band1's neutrinos are from somewhere else, like the main pp chain at lower energies, but if the pp-III stops, does that affect any of the neutrinos in band1?

Hmm. It's unclear. Another approach is to think about the number of neutrinos emitted in the pp-III process. If the pp-III is a major source of high-energy neutrinos, then the flux in higher energy bands would be more affected.

In that case, since band2 is higher energy, the flux in band2 would drop more, increasing the ratio (flux1/flux2).

If before the pp-III stopped, the ratio was around 0.1 (flux1 is one-tenth of flux2), then after the pp-III stops, flux2 drops, making the ratio larger. For example, if flux2 was 100 and flux1 was 10, ratio 0.1. After pp-III stops, flux2 may drop to 10, same as flux1, making ratio 1.

But that's an assumption. The options include C)1 and D)0.1.

But the question is about the approximate ratio. So, perhaps before pp-III stopped, band2's flux was much higher than band1's. So, the ratio is less than 1. After stopping, if band2's flux drops, the ratio increases.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. So, if the pp-III neutrinos were a major component of band2, then stopping it would mean that band2's flux drops, perhaps to a level dominated by other sources, which might be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for band2, so after stopping, band2's flux is zero, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) approach infinity. But none of the options are like that.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So, any other sources of neutrinos in band2 would still be present.

Wait, perhaps the other sources are negligible. So, without the pp-III, band2's flux would be almost zero, making the ratio very large. Since option A is 10, perhaps the ratio is 10.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source for all neutrinos above a certain energy, including band1 and band2. So, if the pp-III stops, both flux1 and flux2 would drop, but perhaps flux2 drops more as it's higher energy.

But without clear data on the neutrino energies, it's tricky. Another approach: solar neutrino experiments like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) observed that the total neutrino flux is consistent with the solar model, which includes the pp-III branch. The SNO results showed that neutrinos oscillate, but the question says oscillations don't play a role here.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stops, so the neutrino flux from that process is gone. The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then flux in band2 would be primarily from pp-III. So, the flux in band2 would drop, while band1's flux remains the same.

If band1's flux was F1 and band2's was F2, and F2 was 10 times F1, then the ratio (F1/F2) was 0.1. After stopping pp-III, F2 drops to (say) F2' = F2_ppIII + F2_other. If F2_other is negligible compared to F2, then F2' ≈ 0, leading to F1/F2' → infinity. But that's not the case as the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps F2_other is non-zero. So, after stopping, F2 = F2_other, which could be, say, 10% of F2 before. So, if F2 was 100 before, and F1 was 10, ratio 0.1. After stopping, F2 drops to, say, 10 (if F2_other is 10), then F1/F2 becomes 10/10 = 1. So, the ratio would be 1.

Another possibility: if the pp-III neutrinos are the only source in band2, but other sources contribute to band1. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are gone, band2's flux drops to zero, but band1's flux remains the same. So, the ratio would be F1 / 0 → infinity. But that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are spread over both bands. So, if the neutrinos from pp-III have a range that includes band1 and band2, then stopping the pp-III would cause both band1 and band2 to drop, but perhaps band2 more so.

Assuming that the majority of pp-III neutrinos are in band2, then the ratio increases.

In that case, the ratio after stopping would be higher than before. If before it was 0.1, and after it's 1, then the answer would be C)1.

Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are in both bands, but primarily in band2, then the flux in band2 would drop more. So, if before, F2 = 10 F1, and after pp-III stops, F2 becomes F2_other, where F2_other is much less than F2, then F1/F2 would be larger.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative contributions. The pp-III branch is less voluminous than the main pp-I branch. So, the neutrinos from pp-III are fewer but higher energy. So, their flux in higher bands is lower than in lower bands.

So, the neutrino flux decreases with energy. So, higher energy bands have lower flux. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy, their contribution to band2 (800-900) would be less than the contribution from other sources (like pp-I) in band1 (700-800).

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when pp-III stops. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band2, their stopping would cause a big drop in band2's flux.

So, prior to the stop, band2's flux was F2, and band1's was F1. If F2 >> F1, then the ratio is small (like 0.1). After the stop, F2 drops to F2_other, perhaps F2_other is much smaller, so the ratio becomes larger.

If F2_other is negligible, the ratio would be F1 / F2_other, which could be much larger than 1, but that's not an option unless F2_other is about F1, making the ratio 1.

Alternatively, perhaps F2_other is about the same as F1, so the ratio becomes 1.

Hmm. Another angle: the main solar neutrinos are from the pep reaction, which are lower energy. The pp-III neutrinos are a minor source but at higher energy.

So, the flux in band1 (700-800) would be dominated by the pep reaction and perhaps other lower-energy processes. The flux in band2 (800-900) would have a smaller contribution from the pp-III branch.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, then band2's flux (which had any contribution from pp-III) would drop. But if the contribution is small, the overall flux in band2 wouldn't drop much.

In that case, perhaps the ratio (flux1/flux2) doesn't change much, leading to approximately 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band2, so their stoppage would cause a significant drop in band2's flux.

In that case, flux2 would drop more, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) increase. So, if previously flux2 was 10 times flux1, then the ratio was 0.1. After stopping, flux2 becomes 1 times flux1, making the ratio 1.

So, the answer would be C)1.

But the options include 0.1, which would be the original ratio before stopping. But the question asks for the ratio after the pp-III stopped.

So, if after the stop, the ratio becomes 1, the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for band2, so after stopping, band2's flux drops to zero, making the ratio (flux1/0) approach infinity. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the ratio is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute about 10% of the flux in band2. So, if band2's flux was 100, and 10 came from pp-III, then after stopping, band2's flux drops to 90. Band1's flux remains the same. So, if band1's flux was 90, then the ratio would be 90/90 =1.

But I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the fact that the neutrino flux decreases with energy. So, higher energy bands have lower flux. So, band2 has less flux than band1. Thus, the ratio flux1/flux2 would be greater than 1, so the correct answer would have to be A)10 or C)1.

But wait, if the neutrino flux is higher at lower energies, then band1 (lower energy) has higher flux than band2. So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would be greater than 1.

But the question is what is the ratio after the pp-III stops.

If the pp-III neutrinos contribute to both bands, but more to band2, then stopping them would reduce band2's flux more, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) larger.

Wait, but if the neutrino flux naturally decreases with energy, which would mean that band1 has higher flux than band2. So, the ratio flux1/flux2 is greater than 1.

But the options for that are A)10 and C)1.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are a minor component, then the flux in band2 would drop a little, making the ratio perhaps 10.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the correct answer is B)0.01, but that's 10^-2. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band1, and stopping them would reduce band1's flux more.

Wait, if pp-III neutrinos are in band1, then stopping them would cause flux1 to drop more than flux2, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) lower.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in band2 and in higher bands. So, stopping them would cause a drop in band2's flux. If band1's flux was from other sources, then flux1 remains the same, and flux2 drops, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) increase.

If, prior to stopping, flux1/flux2 was 0.1, and after stopping, flux2 drops to 0.1 of its original, then ratio becomes 0.1 / 0.1 = 1.

But this is speculative.

I think I've spent too much time. Based on all this, I'm going to guess that the ratio is 1, so the answer is C.

The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV, band 1, and 800-900 keV, band 2) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a significant source of high-energy neutrinos, and its cessation would primarily affect the flux in higher energy bands.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands**:
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos at higher energies, likely in the range of 800-900 keV, which corresponds to band 2.
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) may receive contributions from other processes, such as the pep reaction or lower-energy components of the proton-proton chain, which are unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is a major contributor to the flux in band 2. Its sudden stoppage would significantly reduce the flux in band 2.
   - Band 1's flux, being less dependent on the pp-III branch, would remain relatively unaffected.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux is likely higher than band 1's due to the contributions from the pp-III branch.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux drops significantly, while band 1's flux remains largely unchanged. This increases the ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2.

4. **Options and Reasoning**:
   - **Option A (10)**: This would imply a large increase in the ratio, which is unlikely unless band 2's flux drops to a negligible value.
   - **Option B (0.01)**: This suggests a much smaller flux in band 1 compared to band 2, which contradicts the expectation that band 1's flux remains relatively stable.
   - **Option C (1)**: This is consistent with the scenario where the flux in band 1 and band 2 become comparable after the pp-III branch stops, as band 2's flux drops significantly.
   - **Option D (0.1)**: This represents the ratio before the pp-III branch stops, where band 2's flux is much higher than band 1's. It does not reflect the new ratio after the stoppage.

### Conclusion:
After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 drops significantly, making the ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2 approximately 1. This aligns with **Option C**.
