Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see what the question says.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). Oh wait, but the problem says Pi(+) is stationary. So, the pion is at rest when it decays. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait a second, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions because momentum has to be conserved. So the total momentum after decay must be zero.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, and in the Standard Model, it's massless or nearly massless. So maybe we can approximate its mass as zero. So the neutrino's energy would be equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), so E = |p| for the neutrino.

Wait, but the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be more than that because it's moving. Let's denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu.

Conservation of energy: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Conservation of momentum: Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this magnitude as p.

So for each particle, their energies are related to their momenta and masses.

For the muon: E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. Wait, but in units where c=1, that's E_mu² = p² + m_mu². So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, E_nu = p.

So substituting into the energy conservation equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that's an equation I can solve for p. Let me let x = p for simplicity.

So sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me rearrange: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x

Compute 105.7 squared: 105.7^2 is approximately 11173.29 (since 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025, 105.7^2 is around 11173). Similarly, 139.6^2 is approximately 19488.16.

So 11173.29 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11173.29 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x

Which is: -8314.87 = -279.2 x

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = 8314.87 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV/c approximately.

Wait, but wait a minute, that's the neutrino's momentum, which is equal to its energy. So E_nu = p ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu → 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, earlier I said E_mu = sqrt(x² + 105.7²). So let me compute that.

x is 29.8. So 29.8^2 is about 888.04. 105.7^2 is 11173.29. So their sum is 12061.33. The square root of that is sqrt(12061.33) ≈ 109.8 MeV, which matches what I had earlier.

So the muon's total energy is about 109.8 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, and since its rest mass is effectively zero, all of that is kinetic energy. So the KE for the muon is 4.1 MeV, and KE for the neutrino is 29.8 MeV.

Wait the question asks for the KE of the product particles. The products are the muon and the neutrino. But the options don't have both numbers matching that. Let me check the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, that's close. So that would be the KE of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation. Because sometimes in particle decays, the neutrino's energy is considered, but perhaps relativistic effects are more involved.

Wait, but perhaps I made an approximation, but let me go through the steps again.

We have:

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)

E_nu = p

E_total = E_mu + E_nu = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So substituting:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me let x = p.

sqrt(x² + 11172.49) + x = 139.6

Wait, 105.7 squared is exactly 105.7 * 105.7.

Let me compute that accurately:

105 * 105 = 11025. Then, 0.7^2 = 0.49. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So, sqrt(x² + 11172.49) + x = 139.6.

Rearranged: sqrt(x² + 11172.49) = 139.6 - x.

Squaring both sides:

x² + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Cancel x² terms:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Wait, 139.6^2 is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. So that's correct.

So 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x → -8315.67 = -279.2 x → x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

279.2 into 8315.67.

First, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

279.2 * 0.78 ≈ 217.536.

So 29.78, approximately. So x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So E_nu = x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

E_mu = 139.6 - x → 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV.

Then, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV.

So the muon's KE is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but what about another approach? Let me think about the Q-value of the reaction.

The Q-value is the total rest mass deficit. So Q = m_pi - m_mu - m_nu. But since m_nu is negligible, Q ≈ m_pi - m_mu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Wait, but that's the total energy released in the decay. So the kinetic energies of the products should add up to this Q-value. So 4.12 + 29.8 ≈ 33.92 MeV, which matches. So that checks out.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. So the correct option is D.

To determine the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)):
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

For the muon, its total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]

For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum (\(p_{\mu}\)) and Energy
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) and \(E_{\nu} = p_{\mu}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = 139.6.
\]

Let \(x = p_{\mu}\). Then:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2,
\]
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x,
\]
\[
-8315.67 = -279.2x,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \(E_{\nu} = p_{\mu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), and the muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
Since the neutrino is massless, its entire energy is kinetic:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see what the question says.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). Oh wait, but the problem says Pi(+) is stationary. So, the pion is at rest when it decays. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait a second, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions because momentum has to be conserved. So the total momentum after decay must be zero.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, and in the Standard Model, it's massless or nearly massless. So maybe we can approximate its mass as zero. So the neutrino's energy would be equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), so E = |p| for the neutrino.

Wait, but the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be more than that because it's moving. Let's denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu.

Conservation of energy: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Conservation of momentum: Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this magnitude as p.

So for each particle, their energies are related to their momenta and masses.

For the muon: E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. Wait, but in units where c=1, that's E_mu² = p² + m_mu². So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, E_nu = p.

So substituting into the energy conservation equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that's an equation I can solve for p. Let me let x = p for simplicity.

So sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me rearrange: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x

Compute 105.7 squared: 105.7^2 is approximately 11173.29 (since 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025, 105.7^2 is around 11173). Similarly, 139.6^2 is approximately 19488.16.

So 11173.29 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11173.29 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x

Which is: -8314.87 = -279.2 x

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = 8314.87 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV/c approximately.

Wait, but wait a minute, that's the neutrino's momentum, which is equal to its energy. So E_nu = p ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu → 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, earlier I said E_mu = sqrt(x² + 105.7²). So let me compute that.

x is 29.8. So 29.8^2 is about 888.04. 105.7^2 is 11173.29. So their sum is 12061.33. The square root of that is sqrt(12061.33) ≈ 109.8 MeV, which matches what I had earlier.

So the muon's total energy is about 109.8 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, and since its rest mass is effectively zero, all of that is kinetic energy. So the KE for the muon is 4.1 MeV, and KE for the neutrino is 29.8 MeV.

Wait the question asks for the KE of the product particles. The products are the muon and the neutrino. But the options don't have both numbers matching that. Let me check the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, that's close. So that would be the KE of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation. Because sometimes in particle decays, the neutrino's energy is considered, but perhaps relativistic effects are more involved.

Wait, but perhaps I made an approximation, but let me go through the steps again.

We have:

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)

E_nu = p

E_total = E_mu + E_nu = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So substituting:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me let x = p.

sqrt(x² + 11172.49) + x = 139.6

Wait, 105.7 squared is exactly 105.7 * 105.7.

Let me compute that accurately:

105 * 105 = 11025. Then, 0.7^2 = 0.49. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So, sqrt(x² + 11172.49) + x = 139.6.

Rearranged: sqrt(x² + 11172.49) = 139.6 - x.

Squaring both sides:

x² + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Cancel x² terms:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Wait, 139.6^2 is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. So that's correct.

So 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x → -8315.67 = -279.2 x → x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

279.2 into 8315.67.

First, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

279.2 * 0.78 ≈ 217.536.

So 29.78, approximately. So x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So E_nu = x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

E_mu = 139.6 - x → 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV.

Then, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV.

So the muon's KE is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but what about another approach? Let me think about the Q-value of the reaction.

The Q-value is the total rest mass deficit. So Q = m_pi - m_mu - m_nu. But since m_nu is negligible, Q ≈ m_pi - m_mu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Wait, but that's the total energy released in the decay. So the kinetic energies of the products should add up to this Q-value. So 4.12 + 29.8 ≈ 33.92 MeV, which matches. So that checks out.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. So the correct option is D.


To determine the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)):
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

For the muon, its total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]

For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum (\(p_{\mu}\)) and Energy
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) and \(E_{\nu} = p_{\mu}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = 139.6.
\]

Let \(x = p_{\mu}\). Then:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2,
\]
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x,
\]
\[
-8315.67 = -279.2x,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \(E_{\nu} = p_{\mu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), and the muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
Since the neutrino is massless, its entire energy is kinetic:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Answer: D
