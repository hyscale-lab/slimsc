Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, here it's 1,3-dibromo, so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. Hmm, wait—adamantane is like a diamondoid structure, so the positions are important.

Wait, in the molecule, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH would more likely lead to a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, no, for elimination, the bromines need to be on adjacent carbons. Oh wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—that's not adjacent. So elimination isn't possible. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution? But with two bromines on non-adjacent carbons.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but with more than two steps. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Or maybe it's an E2 elimination where the two bromides are in positions that allow for the formation of a bridge or something else.

Wait, another angle: the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet or maybe a doublet, but high up, around 4.8. That region is typical for an alcohol (-OH) or an ether, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but 1720 is more like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde (which is higher, around 2820, but that's for aldehyde H, the carbonyl is similar). Alternatively, maybe an ester's carbonyl is around 1740, so 1720 is more likely a ketone.

So product 1 has a carbonyl group. How did that form? The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH... maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but 1 and 3 are two apart. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton and the bromide leaves, but that would form a carbocation. Hmm, but in adamantane derivatives, carbocations are not that common, but perhaps with such a stable structure, it could happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the di-elimination leads to the formation of an epoxide? No, that would require adjacent bromines. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction on each Br, but with two leaving groups, but that would form an oxide or something else. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, but in such a high temperature, maybe elimination is more favorable.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol? Because two -OH groups would form from substitution. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The IR shows an absorption at 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Perhaps this is an acetate group, but wait, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe that's from oxidation. But where would the oxygen come from? KOH is not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, elimination of HBr twice to form a double bond, but that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm not quite sure. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base is causing the formation of an epoxide, but again, that requires adjacent leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br being removed as HBr, leading to a conjugated diene? But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm for 2H could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, maybe it's an ether. But the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. For instance, if the elimination leads to the loss of two HBr molecules and the formation of a ring with a double bond that then tautomerizes or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a decomposition. So, considering the structure of adamantane, which is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a chair-like arrangement. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps when heated with KOH, it dehydrohalogenates twice, losing two HBr molecules and forming a bridgehead double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination isn't a bridgehead double bond but something else. Maybe the two bromides are in positions that allow for the formation of a conjugated diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH induces a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Each Br is replaced by an -OH group, leading to a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. If the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for an SN2 mechanism on each Br, but with two leaving groups, perhaps it forms a gem-diolate or something else. But then that would require a good leaving group and a suitable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a carbocation, which then could form a more stable structure. But adamantyl carbocations are quite stable, I think. So maybe each Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a carbocation. But with two Brs, does that lead to a conjugated diene or something else?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product. The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. So, perhaps the product is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a ketone via elimination of two HBr molecules. For example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond, but that wouldn't create a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Another thought: maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic esters and requires an ester group to begin with, which we don't have.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination, where two HBr molecules are lost, and the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, but in this case, they are on 1 and 3. Hmm, perhaps the structure allows for a conjugated elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. But how?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon. So, 1 and 3 would be two bridgehead carbons, perhaps on adjacent positions.

If KOH is present, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, if the two Brs are on bridgeheads, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Hmm. Maybe the product is an alkyne? But that would require dehydrohalogenation twice, but that's not typical with KOH.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. But I'm not sure how that would happen here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a lactone. But that requires an ester or acid group to begin with.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. If two HBr are eliminated, but each elimination forms a ketone group. But how? That would require some kind of oxidation, which KOH doesn't do.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't give a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether. But that would have an oxygen in the structure.

Wait, another angle: the product has 2H in the NMR at 4.79 ppm. Let's think about what that could be. A methylene group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

Wait, wait a minute. The initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group. But how? Let's think about that.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. Perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an O⁻. But with two substitution reactions, perhaps leading to a structure with two oxygen atoms. But then what would that look like?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an epoxide. But for that, the two Brs need to be on adjacent carbons. Since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the product structure. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's think of groups that give a singlet. Maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O, in a symmetric environment.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a vicinal diol (two adjacent OH groups). But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a diol but something else. Let's think about the IR again: 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl. So, the product must have a carbonyl group.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where one Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but the other Br remains. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. So each Br could be replaced by an O⁻, which would then form an oxide. But would that form a carbonyl?

Wait, if two Br atoms are replaced by O⁻, perhaps leading to an oxide bridge. But then the structure would change, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that's for coupling aryl halides with metals, which doesn't apply here.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol that's oxidized, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless there's an elimination that forms an alcohol with a carbonyl elsewhere. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures. The 1H NMR of product 1 has 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm. That's a lot of protons in a multiplet. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons in each ring, so the splitting might come from that.

Wait, let me think about the product 1 again. The IR suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the adamantane structure. But I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating with KOH leads to the formation of a quinone structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. But how? Typically, eliminating HBr would form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, unless it's a vicinal dihalide that upon elimination forms a carbonyl. Oh wait, wait! If you have a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent bromines), elimination would form a double bond. But if you have a geminal dihalide (same carbon), elimination would form a carbonyl group. But in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which isn't a geminal dihalide.

Hmm. So I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me proceed to the next part and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but since adamantane isn't an aromatic compound, that's probably not it. Alternatively, it could be used in some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it could form an acylium ion or something similar. But product 1 probably has a ketone group, so perhaps in product 2, the ketone is converted into an enol ether or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is formed by some kind of cyclization. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but again, adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not certain.

Moving on, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond for this to occur.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond, which is cleaved by ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, putting it all together:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with a ketone group) via KOH.

Product 1 → product 2 (with a double bond) via Al(OiPr)3.

Product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis and workup) with carbonyl groups.

So, the first step must be forming a ketone, and the second step forms an alkene adjacent to the ketone. Then ozonolysis would cleave that alkene into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone? No, that doesn't make sense because the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and forming two ketones would require eliminating two HBr. But that's possible if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two carbons that were attached to Br form double bonds. But if the two Brs are on non-adjacent carbons, how would that form a double bond? Unless it's a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to two double bonds. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a single double bond. But if the starting material has Br on 1 and 3, perhaps the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, but I thought that was not allowed. Unless the structure allows for it somehow.

I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move ahead and think about product 2 and the ozonolysis.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, let's say it's a substituted alkene, perhaps between carbons that were part of the adamantane structure.

When ozonolysis is performed on an alkene, it cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. The specific product depends on the substituents on each end of the double bond.

So, the coupling pattern in product 3 would depend on the structure of product 2's double bond.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to sketch possible structures.

Suppose product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. Let's say it's (something)keto-adamantane.

Then, product 2 is formed when product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3. Perhaps this induces some kind of elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the ketone, leading to an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, product 2 would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). Then, ozonolysis of the double bond would cleave it, forming two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would break the double bond into R-CO and R'-CO.

But wait, in an enone, the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So ozonolysis would break that into R-CO and R'-CO groups.

Wait, but in the case of an enone, the structure is R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R', but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups: R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' → R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' with double bond between the CH₂ groups, making it R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' → no, wait, the correct structure would be R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' if the double bond is between the two CH₂. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of an example: cyclohexenone is a cyclic enone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but when ozonolysis is done on an enone, let's think of 2-pentene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl compounds. For example, pent-2-ene would become two formaldehyde molecules. But that's a simple example.

If product 2 is an enone, say, cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones. But I'm not sure how that would look in this specific case.

But wait, the problem states that after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Assuming that product 3 has carbonyl groups, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl, such as an alpha proton. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

In an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (alpha) are typically split by adjacent protons. For example, if there's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, the protons on the CH₂ would couple with each other and any others nearby.

Wait, let's think more carefully. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a carbonyl group with a neighboring CH₂ group. The protons on the CH₂ would be split by any neighboring groups.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis forms a diketone, perhaps the protons adjacent to the carbonyls are in a certain environment.

Wait, perhaps the original product 2 has a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH₂ groups. For example, if product 2 is an enone like CH₂=CH-CO-R, ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups: O=C-CH₂-O and O=C-CH₂-O (but that's a simplistic view, I think).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the coupling in product 3. The most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Suppose there are two adjacent protons on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl group. Those protons would be split by each other and possibly by any neighboring groups.

Wait, in a typical acyclic ketone, the alpha protons (on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl) are split by the neighboring group. For example, in acetone, the (CH3)2CO, the CH3 protons are split into a septet due to coupling with the other CH3. But in this case, perhaps it's a CH2 group.

So, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', the ozonolysis would break the double bond. But wait, that's if the double bond was between the two CH2 groups. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone, such as R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond between the CH2s. Ozonolysis would cleave this into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, ozonolysis of an internal double bond would break the molecule into two fragments, each ending with a carbonyl group. So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', with the double bond between the CH2 and CH2, ozonolysis would break it into R-CO- and R'-CO.

But wait, considering the actual structure of product 2, perhaps it's a bridged enone, like a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis would generate two ketone groups in product 3.

Now, focusing on the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of a CH2 group. Each proton in CH2 would couple with the other and perhaps with any adjacent protons.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, the two protons on CH2 would be equivalent and split each other into a triplet. Wait, no, because each proton is coupled with the other, so each would be a doublet. Because each H has one neighboring H (the other in the same CH2), so each would be a doublet. But wait, in reality, for a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the coupling between the two Hs would lead to a singlet if they're equivalent. Wait, no, because in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent, so their coupling would result in a singlet.

Wait, no, wait. If the two Hs are on the same carbon (like CH2), each H is coupled to the other. So each would see one neighboring H. The splitting would be a doublet for each. But since they are equivalent, the peak would appear as a singlet. Unless there's another coupling, like to adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, the protons on the first CH2 would couple with the protons on the second CH2. So, each H would be coupled with two Hs (the two on the next CH2), resulting in a triplet.

Wait, let me think again. If the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, where each CH2 is adjacent, then the protons on the first CH2 would be next to the second CH2's two Hs. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet for each group of Hs. But since the two Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent, their coupling would lead to a triplet for each. However, if the two CH2 groups are identical, then each set of Hs would produce a triplet.

But wait, in this scenario, each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H is adjacent to two Hs on the next carbon. So each H would have a coupling constant with those two, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, the coupling between Hs on adjacent carbons (like CH2-CH2) is usually small ( geminal coupling is larger, vicinal is smaller but present). So the splitting would be a triplet for each CH2 group.

But if the Hs are all in the same environment, perhaps it's a singlet. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a simple example: ethylene glycol. No, that's not right. Let's take propane-1,3-diol. The central CH2 group's Hs would be split by the two neighboring CH2 groups, but in that case, each H would be split into a triplet.

Alternatively, consider the NMR of acetone: the methyl groups' Hs are split into a septet due to coupling with the other methyl group's Hs. But that's a geminal coupling, which is larger.

Wait, back to the problem. The most deshielded H in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl. Suppose it's part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups would each have their Hs coupling with the adjacent CH2's Hs. Each CH2 would have two Hs, each coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each proton would have a coupling with two others, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, but wait: if each H on the first CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the next CH2, then each H would be a triplet. So the NMR would show a triplet for each group. But since both CH2 groups are identical, perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, but also adjacent to another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So if the H is on a CH2 next to the carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H would be a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a more complex splitting, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: if the H is coupled with two different groups, each contributing their own splitting, the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

Wait, but in the scenario I thought before, each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So option A, triplet.

But wait, another angle: after ozonolysis, product 3 could have a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. So each H would be split by two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So the answer would be triplet, option A.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

If product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's Hs would be split by the adjacent CH2's Hs. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Yes, that makes sense. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and leading to product 3 after ozonolysis. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, forming product 1.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen).  
   - Based on the data, product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used to catalyze eliminations or cyclizations.  
   - This step likely forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone (enone) by eliminating a proton and forming a double bond adjacent to the ketone group.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide to form product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming two carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is therefore a diketone, with carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was cleaved.

4. **¹H NMR of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to one of the carbonyl groups.  
   - If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons on this CH₂ group will couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - Each proton on the CH₂ group will exhibit a triplet coupling pattern due to the two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.

5. **Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is a triplet, as each proton on the CH₂ group is split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.

ANSWER: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, here it's 1,3-dibromo, so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. Hmm, wait—adamantane is like a diamondoid structure, so the positions are important.

Wait, in the molecule, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH would more likely lead to a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, no, for elimination, the bromines need to be on adjacent carbons. Oh wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—that's not adjacent. So elimination isn't possible. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution? But with two bromines on non-adjacent carbons.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but with more than two steps. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Or maybe it's an E2 elimination where the two bromides are in positions that allow for the formation of a bridge or something else.

Wait, another angle: the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet or maybe a doublet, but high up, around 4.8. That region is typical for an alcohol (-OH) or an ether, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but 1720 is more like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde (which is higher, around 2820, but that's for aldehyde H, the carbonyl is similar). Alternatively, maybe an ester's carbonyl is around 1740, so 1720 is more likely a ketone.

So product 1 has a carbonyl group. How did that form? The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH... maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but 1 and 3 are two apart. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton and the bromide leaves, but that would form a carbocation. Hmm, but in adamantane derivatives, carbocations are not that common, but perhaps with such a stable structure, it could happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the di-elimination leads to the formation of an epoxide? No, that would require adjacent bromines. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction on each Br, but with two leaving groups, but that would form an oxide or something else. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, but in such a high temperature, maybe elimination is more favorable.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol? Because two -OH groups would form from substitution. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The IR shows an absorption at 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Perhaps this is an acetate group, but wait, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe that's from oxidation. But where would the oxygen come from? KOH is not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, elimination of HBr twice to form a double bond, but that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm not quite sure. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base is causing the formation of an epoxide, but again, that requires adjacent leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br being removed as HBr, leading to a conjugated diene? But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm for 2H could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, maybe it's an ether. But the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. For instance, if the elimination leads to the loss of two HBr molecules and the formation of a ring with a double bond that then tautomerizes or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a decomposition. So, considering the structure of adamantane, which is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a chair-like arrangement. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps when heated with KOH, it dehydrohalogenates twice, losing two HBr molecules and forming a bridgehead double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination isn't a bridgehead double bond but something else. Maybe the two bromides are in positions that allow for the formation of a conjugated diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH induces a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Each Br is replaced by an -OH group, leading to a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. If the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for an SN2 mechanism on each Br, but with two leaving groups, perhaps it forms a gem-diolate or something else. But then that would require a good leaving group and a suitable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a carbocation, which then could form a more stable structure. But adamantyl carbocations are quite stable, I think. So maybe each Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a carbocation. But with two Brs, does that lead to a conjugated diene or something else?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product. The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. So, perhaps the product is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a ketone via elimination of two HBr molecules. For example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond, but that wouldn't create a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Another thought: maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic esters and requires an ester group to begin with, which we don't have.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination, where two HBr molecules are lost, and the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, but in this case, they are on 1 and 3. Hmm, perhaps the structure allows for a conjugated elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. But how?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon. So, 1 and 3 would be two bridgehead carbons, perhaps on adjacent positions.

If KOH is present, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, if the two Brs are on bridgeheads, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Hmm. Maybe the product is an alkyne? But that would require dehydrohalogenation twice, but that's not typical with KOH.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. But I'm not sure how that would happen here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a lactone. But that requires an ester or acid group to begin with.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. If two HBr are eliminated, but each elimination forms a ketone group. But how? That would require some kind of oxidation, which KOH doesn't do.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't give a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether. But that would have an oxygen in the structure.

Wait, another angle: the product has 2H in the NMR at 4.79 ppm. Let's think about what that could be. A methylene group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

Wait, wait a minute. The initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group. But how? Let's think about that.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. Perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an O⁻. But with two substitution reactions, perhaps leading to a structure with two oxygen atoms. But then what would that look like?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an epoxide. But for that, the two Brs need to be on adjacent carbons. Since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the product structure. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's think of groups that give a singlet. Maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O, in a symmetric environment.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a vicinal diol (two adjacent OH groups). But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a diol but something else. Let's think about the IR again: 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl. So, the product must have a carbonyl group.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where one Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but the other Br remains. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. So each Br could be replaced by an O⁻, which would then form an oxide. But would that form a carbonyl?

Wait, if two Br atoms are replaced by O⁻, perhaps leading to an oxide bridge. But then the structure would change, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that's for coupling aryl halides with metals, which doesn't apply here.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol that's oxidized, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless there's an elimination that forms an alcohol with a carbonyl elsewhere. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures. The 1H NMR of product 1 has 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm. That's a lot of protons in a multiplet. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons in each ring, so the splitting might come from that.

Wait, let me think about the product 1 again. The IR suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the adamantane structure. But I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating with KOH leads to the formation of a quinone structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. But how? Typically, eliminating HBr would form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, unless it's a vicinal dihalide that upon elimination forms a carbonyl. Oh wait, wait! If you have a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent bromines), elimination would form a double bond. But if you have a geminal dihalide (same carbon), elimination would form a carbonyl group. But in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which isn't a geminal dihalide.

Hmm. So I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me proceed to the next part and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but since adamantane isn't an aromatic compound, that's probably not it. Alternatively, it could be used in some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it could form an acylium ion or something similar. But product 1 probably has a ketone group, so perhaps in product 2, the ketone is converted into an enol ether or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is formed by some kind of cyclization. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but again, adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not certain.

Moving on, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond for this to occur.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond, which is cleaved by ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, putting it all together:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with a ketone group) via KOH.

Product 1 → product 2 (with a double bond) via Al(OiPr)3.

Product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis and workup) with carbonyl groups.

So, the first step must be forming a ketone, and the second step forms an alkene adjacent to the ketone. Then ozonolysis would cleave that alkene into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone? No, that doesn't make sense because the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and forming two ketones would require eliminating two HBr. But that's possible if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two carbons that were attached to Br form double bonds. But if the two Brs are on non-adjacent carbons, how would that form a double bond? Unless it's a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to two double bonds. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a single double bond. But if the starting material has Br on 1 and 3, perhaps the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, but I thought that was not allowed. Unless the structure allows for it somehow.

I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move ahead and think about product 2 and the ozonolysis.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, let's say it's a substituted alkene, perhaps between carbons that were part of the adamantane structure.

When ozonolysis is performed on an alkene, it cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. The specific product depends on the substituents on each end of the double bond.

So, the coupling pattern in product 3 would depend on the structure of product 2's double bond.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to sketch possible structures.

Suppose product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. Let's say it's (something)keto-adamantane.

Then, product 2 is formed when product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3. Perhaps this induces some kind of elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the ketone, leading to an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, product 2 would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). Then, ozonolysis of the double bond would cleave it, forming two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would break the double bond into R-CO and R'-CO.

But wait, in an enone, the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So ozonolysis would break that into R-CO and R'-CO groups.

Wait, but in the case of an enone, the structure is R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R', but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups: R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' → R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' with double bond between the CH₂ groups, making it R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' → no, wait, the correct structure would be R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-R' if the double bond is between the two CH₂. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of an example: cyclohexenone is a cyclic enone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but when ozonolysis is done on an enone, let's think of 2-pentene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl compounds. For example, pent-2-ene would become two formaldehyde molecules. But that's a simple example.

If product 2 is an enone, say, cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones. But I'm not sure how that would look in this specific case.

But wait, the problem states that after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Assuming that product 3 has carbonyl groups, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl, such as an alpha proton. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

In an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (alpha) are typically split by adjacent protons. For example, if there's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, the protons on the CH₂ would couple with each other and any others nearby.

Wait, let's think more carefully. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a carbonyl group with a neighboring CH₂ group. The protons on the CH₂ would be split by any neighboring groups.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis forms a diketone, perhaps the protons adjacent to the carbonyls are in a certain environment.

Wait, perhaps the original product 2 has a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH₂ groups. For example, if product 2 is an enone like CH₂=CH-CO-R, ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups: O=C-CH₂-O and O=C-CH₂-O (but that's a simplistic view, I think).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the coupling in product 3. The most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Suppose there are two adjacent protons on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl group. Those protons would be split by each other and possibly by any neighboring groups.

Wait, in a typical acyclic ketone, the alpha protons (on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl) are split by the neighboring group. For example, in acetone, the (CH3)2CO, the CH3 protons are split into a septet due to coupling with the other CH3. But in this case, perhaps it's a CH2 group.

So, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', the ozonolysis would break the double bond. But wait, that's if the double bond was between the two CH2 groups. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone, such as R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond between the CH2s. Ozonolysis would cleave this into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, ozonolysis of an internal double bond would break the molecule into two fragments, each ending with a carbonyl group. So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', with the double bond between the CH2 and CH2, ozonolysis would break it into R-CO- and R'-CO.

But wait, considering the actual structure of product 2, perhaps it's a bridged enone, like a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis would generate two ketone groups in product 3.

Now, focusing on the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of a CH2 group. Each proton in CH2 would couple with the other and perhaps with any adjacent protons.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, the two protons on CH2 would be equivalent and split each other into a triplet. Wait, no, because each proton is coupled with the other, so each would be a doublet. Because each H has one neighboring H (the other in the same CH2), so each would be a doublet. But wait, in reality, for a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the coupling between the two Hs would lead to a singlet if they're equivalent. Wait, no, because in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent, so their coupling would result in a singlet.

Wait, no, wait. If the two Hs are on the same carbon (like CH2), each H is coupled to the other. So each would see one neighboring H. The splitting would be a doublet for each. But since they are equivalent, the peak would appear as a singlet. Unless there's another coupling, like to adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, the protons on the first CH2 would couple with the protons on the second CH2. So, each H would be coupled with two Hs (the two on the next CH2), resulting in a triplet.

Wait, let me think again. If the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, where each CH2 is adjacent, then the protons on the first CH2 would be next to the second CH2's two Hs. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet for each group of Hs. But since the two Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent, their coupling would lead to a triplet for each. However, if the two CH2 groups are identical, then each set of Hs would produce a triplet.

But wait, in this scenario, each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H is adjacent to two Hs on the next carbon. So each H would have a coupling constant with those two, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, the coupling between Hs on adjacent carbons (like CH2-CH2) is usually small ( geminal coupling is larger, vicinal is smaller but present). So the splitting would be a triplet for each CH2 group.

But if the Hs are all in the same environment, perhaps it's a singlet. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a simple example: ethylene glycol. No, that's not right. Let's take propane-1,3-diol. The central CH2 group's Hs would be split by the two neighboring CH2 groups, but in that case, each H would be split into a triplet.

Alternatively, consider the NMR of acetone: the methyl groups' Hs are split into a septet due to coupling with the other methyl group's Hs. But that's a geminal coupling, which is larger.

Wait, back to the problem. The most deshielded H in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl. Suppose it's part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups would each have their Hs coupling with the adjacent CH2's Hs. Each CH2 would have two Hs, each coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each proton would have a coupling with two others, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, but wait: if each H on the first CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the next CH2, then each H would be a triplet. So the NMR would show a triplet for each group. But since both CH2 groups are identical, perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, but also adjacent to another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So if the H is on a CH2 next to the carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H would be a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a more complex splitting, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: if the H is coupled with two different groups, each contributing their own splitting, the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

Wait, but in the scenario I thought before, each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So option A, triplet.

But wait, another angle: after ozonolysis, product 3 could have a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. So each H would be split by two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So the answer would be triplet, option A.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

If product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's Hs would be split by the adjacent CH2's Hs. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Yes, that makes sense. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and leading to product 3 after ozonolysis. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, forming product 1.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen).  
   - Based on the data, product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used to catalyze eliminations or cyclizations.  
   - This step likely forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone (enone) by eliminating a proton and forming a double bond adjacent to the ketone group.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide to form product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming two carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is therefore a diketone, with carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was cleaved.

4. **¹H NMR of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to one of the carbonyl groups.  
   - If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons on this CH₂ group will couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - Each proton on the CH₂ group will exhibit a triplet coupling pattern due to the two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.

5. **Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is a triplet, as each proton on the CH₂ group is split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.

ANSWER: A
