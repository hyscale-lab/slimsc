Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and they want to figure out what it is using some spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the spectral info to one of them.

Let me start by looking at the data provided. 

The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, 158 is two units higher than 156. That makes me think about possible adducts or maybe a chlorine isotope. Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35, but there's also a natural abundance of about 75% for Cl-35 and 25% for Cl-37. So, the M peak here might be the Cl-35 version, and the M+2 would be Cl-37. So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl atom. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That sounds like it has a Cl, a hydroxyl, and a benzaldehyde group.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That would be a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position.

C) Phenyl chloroformate. That's like an OCl group attached, perhaps as an ester or something.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl in the ortho position relative to the COOH group.

Now, the molecular weight given is 156. Let me calculate the molecular weights of these options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl (35.5) gives 12*7 + 1*6 + 16*2 + 35.5 = 84 +6 +32 +35.5 = 157.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a problem. Because 157.5 would round to about 158, but the peak is at 156. So maybe this isn't correct. Or maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, let me recalculate. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2: 7*12=84, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total is 84+6+32=122. Adding Cl (35.5) makes 157.5. So the molecular ion should be at around 158. But the given is 156 as the base peak. Hmm, that's a problem. So option B might not be the correct one.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, same molecular formula, same molecular weight. So same issue. Both B and D have the same molecular formula, so their molecular weight would be the same. So if the molecular weight is 157.5, but the peak is at 156, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion is not at M but at M+. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the other data to see which options fit better.

Let's look at the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, especially in carboxylic acids or alcohols. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is around the carbonyl region. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, but if it's an acid, the O-H would be very strong and broad. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde would show a peak around that area. Wait, let's think:

- Aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but the IR here shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl (C=O). So maybe it's a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group. So the IR would show a strong aldehyde C=O (around 1720 maybe?), and an O-H stretch, which would be broad. But the aldehyde's O-H is from the aldehyde group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzaldehyde is an aldehyde, so the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm in NMR. But wait, the IR's O-H would be from the hydroxyl group in the structure. So this compound has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group. So the IR would show both.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid, so the O-H stretch would be very broad, and the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Maybe that's a bit conflicting.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That would be something like Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl would be strong and maybe around 1720. The O-H stretch? Wait, chloroformate is an ester; does it have an O-H? No, because chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Ph. Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate is ClCOOPh, right? So the functional groups are Cl, carbonyl (ester), and an O from the ester. So the IR would show the ester carbonyl (maybe around 1720), and if there's an O-H, but wait, in this compound, the ester doesn't have an O-H. Unless it's under certain conditions, but in the solid state, maybe not. So the IR in the question has a broad peak, which suggests an O-H. So if option C doesn't have O-H, then the broad peak might not fit. Hmm.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, same reasoning. So the same issue of molecular weight applies.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, but for B and D, the molecular ion would be at 157.5, which is approximately 158. So why is the base peak at 156?

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the molecular formula. Let me re-calculate each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula is C7H5ClO2.

Carbon:7, Hydrogen:5, Cl:1, O:2.

Molecular weight: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (2*16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So about 156.5. So the molecular ion would be around 156 or 157. But the molecular ion is at 156, and M+2 at 158 (which would be 156 + 2 = 158). So that fits with a molecular weight of 156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, and M+2 at 158, which matches the Cl isotope pattern. So this could fit.

So option A would have a molecular weight of approximately 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156, and M+2 (Cl-37) at 158. So that matches the mass spec.

Now, looking at the IR. Option A has a hydroxyl group and a benzaldehyde group. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is likely the O-H stretch of the hydroxyl. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably the aldehyde C=O. But wait, aldehydes typically have C=O around 1720 cm^-1, yes. Or wait, sometimes they're a bit lower. Alternatively, could it be a ketone? But in this case, the compound is an aldehyde. So the IR would fit.

Looking at the NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

In aromatic regions, the protons are typically in the 7-8 ppm range. The 11 ppm is a singlet, which is likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but in some cases, maybe it's a phenolic O-H? No, phenolic O-H would be broad, but here it's a singlet, so maybe not. Wait, but in the structure of A, it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the aldehyde proton is at the para position relative to the hydroxyl, but I'm not sure about the exact shifts.

Wait, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which is a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but sometimes in certain environments, they can be upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in this case, it's a singlet. So perhaps it's an aldehyde proton.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B and D are carboxylic acids. Let's think about their NMR.

If the compound is a benzoic acid, then the COOH proton would typically be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR data, the singlet at 11 ppm is a single proton. Wait, but for a COOH, it's usually a broad peak, but in the data given, it's a singlet. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the singlet is from an aldehyde proton.

So for option A, the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The aldehyde proton would be on the benzene ring. In such a case, the aldehyde proton is a singlet because there are no neighboring protons (since it's attached to the ring). So in the NMR, it would appear as a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But here it's at 11 ppm. Hmm, a bit high, but maybe possible. Alternatively, maybe the 11 ppm is the hydroxyl proton.

Wait, but aromatic aldehydes have a proton on the carbonyl group, which is a singlet. So in the NMR, that should be a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But what about the 11 ppm? Maybe there's another proton. Wait, the structure of option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have the aldehyde group at position 2, the hydroxyl at position 2 as well? No, wait, position 2 is where the aldehyde is. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. Let me visualize the structure. The benzaldehyde has the aldehyde group at position 1 (the first carbon). Then, the hydroxyl is at position 2, and Cl at position 3.

Wait, but benzaldehyde is o-hydroxybenzaldehyde in this case. Wait, but in any case, the aldehyde proton would be on the aldehyde group, which is a singlet. So the 11 ppm is a bit high, but perhaps it's a phenolic O-H. Wait, the hydroxyl proton in phenol is usually broader and around 5 ppm, but when deprotonated or in certain environments, maybe it's higher. But in the NMR, it's a singlet at 11 ppm, which I associate more with an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's the carboxylic acid proton. Let's think about that.

If the compound is a benzoic acid (like options B and D), then the carboxylic acid proton would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in the given NMR data, the peak at 11 ppm is a singlet, which might not fit because the COOH proton is usually broad, not a singlet.

Wait, but in the case of a solid or something, maybe it's exchanged and shows as a singlet. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the aldehyde.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR.

The 1H NMR data has three sets:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.72 (d, 2H)

The 8.02 and 7.72 are doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, as each pair of protons is equivalent and split into doublets. So perhaps two substituents in the para positions, making the aromatic protons appear as two doublets.

Wait, but the number of protons: the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about this.

In option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The substituents are at positions 2 (hydroxyl), 3 (Cl), and 1 (aldehyde). So the benzene ring would have substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3? That would mean the structure is more ortho, meta. Wait, benzaldehyde is at position 1, hydroxyl at 2, Cl at 3. So the substituents are adjacent (ortho) to each other. So the remaining positions are 4,5,6. Wait, no. Let me number it properly.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's imagine the benzene ring. The aldehyde is at position 1. Then the hydroxy is at position 2 (ortho to aldehyde). The Cl is at position 3 (meta to aldehyde). So the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the ring has three substituents.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would be on positions 4,5,6. But wait, position 4 is across from Cl (position 3), position 5 is across from OH (position 2), and position 6 is across from CHO (position 1). Wait, maybe not, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like para substituents. Let's think about option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the substituents are para to each other, leaving the other positions (2,3,5,6) with protons.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would be on positions 2,3,5,6. But in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are in two sets: those ortho to substituents and those meta. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons on the ring are in two pairs: the two ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6), which are equivalent, and the two meta (positions 3 and5), which are equivalent. So in the NMR, these would appear as two doublets. Because each proton in the ortho positions would be adjacent to the COOH group, causing splitting.

Wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho, and those at 3 and 5 would be meta. The H at position 4 is Cl, so no proton.

So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the structure is Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. So the substituents are Cl at 4, COOH at 1. So the aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6.

Wait, but in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and the protons at 3 and5 would be meta to COOH.

In the NMR, the ortho protons would typically be deshielded and appear downfield. The meta protons would be less deshielded.

In the given NMR data, there's a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H).

So in the case of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. The ortho protons (2 and6) would be more deshielded, so higher ppm. Let's say around 8.0 ppm, and the meta protons (3 and5) around 7.7 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

So the 8.02 (d, 2H) would be the ortho protons, and 7.72 (d, 2H) the meta.

And then there's the singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the COOH proton. But wait, in the NMR, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in this data, it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe in the solid state, or perhaps the sample is not fully dissolved, leading to a sharp peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton.

Wait, but for benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. The singlet at 11 ppm might fit if it's a sharp peak. But that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe the 11 ppm is from another group.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a chloroformate (option C), then the structure would be O=C(OCl)Ph. But in that case, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as a quartet or something else, depending on substitution. Also, chloroformate's carbonyl is around 1720, which matches the IR. But where would the O-H be? Wait, chloroformate doesn't have an O-H group, so the IR's broad peak wouldn't fit.

So, perhaps option C is less likely because the IR shows a broad peak, suggesting an O-H, which chloroformate doesn't have.

So, back to options A and B. Let's check their IR and NMR.

Option A: has OH and CHO groups. IR shows broad O-H and strong C=O. So that fits.

In the NMR, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet, maybe around 9-10 ppm. But the data shows 11 ppm. Maybe this is an error, but perhaps it's correct. The other aromatic protons would be split into doublets. But in option A, the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the remaining protons are at positions 4,5,6.

Wait, position 4 is adjacent to Cl (position3) and across from position1 (CHO). Position5 is adjacent to OH (position2) and across from position4. Position6 is next to position1 (CHO) and position5.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the structure has two substituents on the ring, making the aromatic protons split into two doublets. Let me think about that.

Wait, if the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the substituents are at 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring has three substituents, making the aromatic protons not all equivalent. So, perhaps the ring has two sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the protons in positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry, and protons in 5 and something else? Not sure. Maybe in that case, the NMR would show more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents in para positions. Let's consider option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So the COOH is at position1, Cl at position2. So the substituents are at ortho positions. Then the aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6. Hmm, which would be more complex.

But the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So perhaps the molecule has two substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So going back, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. COOH at 1, Cl at 4. So substituents are para. So the aromatic protons at 2,3,5,6. Then, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (ortho to COOH), and positions 3 and5 are equivalent (meta to COOH). So in NMR, they would be two doublets. The 8.02 ppm would be the ortho protons (more deshielded), and 7.72 the meta.

In that case, the NMR fits. Then, the singlet at 11 ppm would be the COOH proton. But as I thought earlier, the COOH proton is usually broad, but in this data, it's a singlet. Maybe it's because the sample is not in solution, or perhaps it's a different environment.

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Then the compound would be an aldehyde with substituents. So option A.

In that case, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet. The aromatic protons would show as two doublets (each 2H), which would suggest that the substituents are in such a way that the remaining protons are in two sets of two, each with coupling.

So in option A, the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the remaining protons are on positions 4,5,6. Wait, that's three protons, but the NMR shows 4 protons (2+2). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, unless the substituents are in such a way that the ring has only two substituents, making the aromatic protons split into two doublets. So perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H5ClO2. Molar mass is 156.5. So the molecular ion would be around 156.5, giving a peak at 156 (base peak) and M+2 (Cl-37) at 158, which matches the data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2 as well. So same molecular formula. So both A and B have the same molecular formula, but different structures.

So the mass spec can't differentiate between A and B, since same molecular weight.

Looking at the IR again. Option A would have an aldehyde C=O (around 1720) and a hydroxyl O-H (broad). Option B would have a carboxylic acid O-H (broad) and a carboxylic acid C=O (around 1700, but the IR shows 1720). So 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Maybe that's more consistent with an aldehyde. So that would suggest option A.

Then, the NMR. For option A, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm, but the data has it at 11 ppm. The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, which would fit if the substituents are in such a way that the remaining protons split into two sets of two. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, making the protons at 2,4,5,6 have two doublets.

Wait, but 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the remaining protons are at 4,5,6. That's three protons. But in the NMR, we have 4 H in the aromatic region summed (2+2). So that doesn't fit. So maybe option A isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in para positions. Let me think again.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So COOH at position1, Cl at position2. So substituents are ortho. Then the aromatic protons are at 3,4,5,6. Protons at 3 and5 would be equivalent (meta to COOH), and protons at4 and6 would be equivalent (para to COOH). Wait, but that would be a more complex splitting, perhaps as doublets of doublets or something else. But in the given data, it's two doublets. So if the substituents are in para, the aromatic protons would be two sets of two.

So considering that, option B has substituents in para, leading to two doublets in NMR. So let me think again about the NMR.

In option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):

- The COOH proton is at around 11 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but COOH protons are usually broad. So why is it a singlet here? Maybe it's not the COOH, but something else.

Wait another thought: maybe the 11 ppm is the Cl on the benzene? No, Cl doesn't have a proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm is an exchangeable proton, like the OH group in the aldehyde. But the OH in an aldehyde is usually not as acidic as a carboxylic acid. Or maybe it's a different environment.

Wait, but if the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to COOH. So in the NMR, the ortho protons (2 and6) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) and the meta (3 and5) would be lower. So in the data, 8.02 and 7.72 make sense.

The 11.0 ppm is the COOH proton, but perhaps in the solid state, it's a singlet. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the IR. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak would be very broad, but the data shows a broad peak. So that fits.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. In the benzoic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700. So 1720 is a bit high, which might suggest an aldehyde.

So the IR data would more fit an aldehyde.

So maybe option A is correct despite the NMR seeming off.

Wait, but in the NMR of option A, the aromatic protons would not split into two doublets of two each. Because substituents are at 1,2,3, leaving three H's on the ring, which would not split into two doublets. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it mentally.

Option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

So the benzene ring has:

- Position 1: CHO (aldehyde)
- Position 2: OH (hydroxyl)
- Position 3: Cl (chlorine)

So the substituents are at 1,2,3. So the remaining positions are 4,5,6. So:

- Position 4: ortho to Cl (position3), meta to CHO (position1)
- Position5: meta to OH (position2)
- Position6: ortho to CHO (position1), meta to Cl (position3)

Wait, this is getting complicated. So the protons on positions 4,5,6 are in different environments. So the NMR would show three sets of protons, not two. Therefore, the NMR data that only shows two sets (each 2H) doesn't fit option A.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe option A is not the correct one.

Looking back, perhaps option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So the substituents are at position 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So, the aromatic protons are at 3,4,5,6.

In such a case, the protons at position3 and5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. The protons at position4 and6 would be para to COOH and meta to Cl.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons split into two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the NMR data's two doublets suggest that the aromatic ring has two pairs of equivalent protons, which would happen in para substitution.

So, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents are para (COOH at1, Cl at4). This would leave protons at 2,3,5,6.

The protons at 2 and6 are ortho to COOH. The protons at3 and5 are meta to COOH.

In such a case, in the NMR, the protons at2 and6 would couple with each other and with any adjacent protons. But in a para-substituted benzene, the ortho protons are equivalent, so their signal would be a doublet (coupled with the meta protons). Similarly, the meta protons would also be equivalent and show as a doublet.

So that matches the NMR data: two doublets, each 2H.

Then, the singlet at 11 ppm could be the COOH proton. But again, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak. Why is it a singlet here?

Wait, perhaps the sample is in the solid state, so the COOH proton is not exchanging and appears as a sharp singlet. Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at1720, which fits more with an aldehyde than a carboxylic acid. Because aldehydes typically have higher wavenumber for C=O.

Wait, let me check typical C=O stretching frequencies:

- Aldehydes: ~1720 cm^-1
- Ketones: ~1715 cm^-1
- Carboxylic acids: ~1700 cm^-1
- Esters: ~1740 cm^-1

So the IR's 1720 cm^-1 suggests an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. So if the IR is correct, then option B (a carboxylic acid) would have a lower wavenumber. So maybe that suggests option A is more likely.

But earlier, the NMR didn't fit for option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of option A.

Another possibility: the compound is an acid, but the molecular ion is at 156. Wait, let me recalculate the molecular weight for option B again.

C7H5ClO2: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl)=35.5, O2=32. So 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So molecular ion at 156.5, so the M+2 is 158.5, which would be 158. So the mass spec data fits.

So with the IR suggesting a C=O around 1720 (aldehyde), but the molecular formula fitting benzoic acid, perhaps I'm conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the IR's 1720 is from an ester or another carbonyl group. Let me think about option C: phenyl chloroformate.

Phenyl chloroformate would have a structure like Cl-CO-O-Ph. The C=O would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the IR data. But the IR also shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Chloroformate doesn't have an O-H group, so why is there a broad peak? Maybe it's an impurity or something else. Hmm, perhaps not.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not fully confident because the NMR's singlet at 11 ppm doesn't fit with a COOH proton.

Alternatively, maybe it's option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So the substituents are at position1 (COOH) and position2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6.

So, in this case, the protons at3 and5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. The protons at4 and6 would be para to COOH and meta to Cl.

In the NMR, would the protons be split into two doublets?

Hmm, perhaps not. Because substituents are in ortho positions, the splitting could be more complex. So maybe the NMR for option D wouldn't show two clean doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the aromatic protons are in two pairs.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, making the remaining protons at 2,4,5,6. Then, perhaps the protons at 2 and6 are equivalent, and 4 and5 are equivalent, leading to two doublets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic ring is para substituted, but with only two substituents. Then the NMR would show two doublets.

Wait, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid: substituents at 1 and4. So the aromatic protons are at 2,3,5,6. So, the protons at2 and6 are ortho, and3 and5 are meta. So in NMR, they would appear as two doublets.

The aldehyde in option A would have substituents at1,2,3, leading to three different sets of aromatic protons, which doesn't fit the NMR data.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, despite the singlet at 11 ppm.

Wait, but the IR's C=O is at 1720, which is higher than a typical carboxylic acid. Maybe the compound is an acyl chloride, but then the molecular weight would be different.

Wait, or perhaps it's a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak isn't from O-H. Let me think: the broad peak from 3500 to 2700 could be an aliphatic O-H stretch, but that's unusual for an aromatic compound. Alternatively, it could be an N-H stretch, but none of the options have N.

Hmm, perhaps the broad peak is from a hydroxyl group, which fits with options A, B, D, but not C.

So, putting it all together, the NMR data suggests two doublets in the aromatic region, which would fit a para-substituted benzene. The IR's C=O at 1720 suggests an aldehyde or ester, but the presence of a broad O-H suggests a carboxylic acid or alcohol.

But the options don't have esters except C, which doesn't have O-H. So perhaps option B is the correct answer, but I'm a bit torn because the IR's C=O is higher than expected for a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an acyl chloride, but none of the options are that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the IR's 1720 is from an ester. But in the options, only option C is an ester (chloroformate). But option C doesn't have an O-H, so the broad peak doesn't fit.

Wait, but the mass spec for option C would be different.

Option C: phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is same as options A and B: 156.5. So molecular ion at 156, M+2 at 158—so that fits.

IR: strong peak at1720 cm^-1 (ester C=O), but no O-H. So the broad peak from 3500-2700 wouldn't fit, since there's no O-H. So option C is unlikely.

Thus, going back, the best fit is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Despite the NMR's COOH proton being a singlet, perhaps the sample's conditions are causing it to appear as such.

So, the IR's C=O being higher than expected, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with some electronic effects or something else. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from a conjugated carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's 1720 cm^-1 is from a C=O in a different environment.

In conclusion, after considering all the data, I think option B is the correct answer.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and the M+2 peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest a molecular weight of approximately 156.5, consistent with the formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**. The M+2 peak indicates the presence of a chlorine atom due to its natural abundance isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37). 

### IR Analysis:
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). This wavenumber is consistent with an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid, though slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: Likely corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is typically a broad peak but can appear as a singlet under certain conditions (e.g., in the solid state).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two sets of equivalent protons.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**, molecular weight ~156.5.  
   - IR: The aldehyde C=O (~1720 cm⁻¹) and hydroxyl O-H (broad) fit.  
   - NMR: The aromatic protons would not split into two doublets (2H each) because the substituents (CHO, OH, Cl) are at positions 1, 2, and 3, leaving three non-equivalent protons. This does not match the NMR data.  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatched NMR.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**, molecular weight ~156.5.  
   - IR: The carboxylic acid O-H (broad) and C=O (~1720 cm⁻¹) fit, though the C=O wavenumber is slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid.  
   - NMR: The aromatic protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH) would appear as two doublets (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, 2H each), consistent with the data. The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the COOH proton.  
   - **Fits all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**, molecular weight ~156.5.  
   - IR: The ester C=O (~1720 cm⁻¹) fits, but there is no O-H group, contradicting the broad peak in the IR spectrum.  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatched IR.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - Molecular formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**, molecular weight ~156.5.  
   - IR: The carboxylic acid O-H (broad) and C=O (~1720 cm⁻¹) fit.  
   - NMR: The substituents (COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2) would result in more complex splitting of the aromatic protons, not two clean doublets.  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatched NMR.

### Conclusion:
Option B, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, is the only compound that fits the molecular weight, IR, and NMR data. The singlet at 11.0 ppm can be attributed to the COOH proton under specific conditions, and the aromatic protons match the para-substituted benzene structure.
