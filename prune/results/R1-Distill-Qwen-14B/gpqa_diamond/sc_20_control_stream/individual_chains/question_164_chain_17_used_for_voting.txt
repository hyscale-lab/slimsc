Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right? They orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. Let me try to think through this.

So, the problem states there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations show they have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal, and their amplitudes are given. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

I remember that in binary systems, the masses of the stars are inversely proportional to their velocities. Because the more massive star would be moving more slowly around the center of mass. So if one star has a higher velocity amplitude, it's less massive, and the other is more massive.

Wait, so if star A has velocity v_A and star B has v_B, then their masses are inversely proportional. So m_A / m_B = v_B / v_A. Because center of mass requires m_A * v_A = m_B * v_B. So yes, mass ratio is inverse of velocity ratio.

But wait, the question is about the total mass of each system. So the total mass of system_1 would be m1 + m2, and system_2 would be M1 + M2, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the second system's stars.

I think I need to find the mass function here. Or maybe use the formula for the mass of the binary system.

Wait, I recall that the mass function relates the observed velocities and the orbital period to the mass of the system. The formula is something like f(m) = (v^3 * P) / (2πG), but wait, that's when you have one star's velocity known. Since in this problem, both stars' velocities are given, maybe I can get the mass ratio and then compute the total mass.

Let me think. In a binary system, the two stars orbit each other. The ratio of their masses is m1/m2 = (velocity2)/(velocity1), because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 (they have to balance around the center of mass). So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half of m2? Wait wait, no, because if m1 is more massive, it would have a smaller velocity. Oh wait, no, wait. Let's see: if star A is more massive, it's moving slower. So if star A has velocity vA, star B has velocity vB. Since m_A * vA = m_B * vB, because the center of mass is stationary.

So m_A / m_B = vB / vA.

So for system_1: vA is 10 km/s (primary eclipse probably the brighter star?) and vB is 5 km/s. So m_A / m_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_A = 0.5 m_B. So the masses are m1 = 0.5 m2. So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. Wait, but wait, I think I might have this backwards. Let me clarify.

Wait, system_1's stars have velocities 10 and 5. So m1 (first star) is 10, m2 is 5? No, no, wait. The mass ratio is m1/m2 = v2 / v1.

Ah, right. So in system_1, star 1 has velocity v1=10, star 2 has v2=5. So m1/m2 = v2 / v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half of m2. So m1=0.5 m2, and the total mass is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly for system_2: the velocities are 15 and 10. So the mass ratio m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So m1 = (2/3) m2. Then the total mass is m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2 ≈ 1.6667 m2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So I need to compute (mass of system_1) / (mass of system_2).

So the mass of system_1 is 1.5 m2, where m2 is the mass of the second star in system_1. Wait, no, perhaps I should relate it to the same variables.

Wait, perhaps I should let system_1's masses be m1 and m2, and system_2's masses be M1 and M2.

So for system_1: m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5 → m1 = 0.5 m2.

So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

For system_2: M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M1 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass for system_2: M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2 ≈ 1.6667 M2.

So the question is, system_1's total mass is 1.5 m2, system_2's is 1.6667 M2.

But how are these related? Wait, I think I'm getting confused because I used m2 and M2 as different variables. Let me rephrase.

Let me denote:

For system_1:

v1 (star 1) = 10 km/s → m1 / m2 = v2 / v1 = 5 /10 = 0.5 → m1 = 0.5 m2.

Total mass, M1_total = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

For system_2:

v1 (star 1) =15, v2=10. So M1 / M2 = v2 /v1 =10/15 = 2/3 → M1 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass, M2_total = M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2 ≈1.6667 M2.

Now, to find the ratio (M1_total)/(M2_total) = (1.5 m2) / (1.6667 M2).

But I think I'm missing something. Oh wait, I think I mixed up variables because the mass in system_1 is m2, and in system_2 it's M2. But I need to relate the actual masses between the two systems. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should find the mass ratio (M1_total / M2_total) in terms of the velocities and periods.

Wait, another approach: the mass function for a binary system is given by f(m) = (v^3 P) / (2πG), but that's when you have the velocity of one star and the period. But here, I have both velocities. So perhaps the total mass is related to the sum of the velocities?

Alternatively, the mass of the system can be determined from the sum of the velocities and the period, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let me think again. The system's total mass can be found if we know the orbital period and the velocities. Because the velocity is related to the orbital circumference. The stars orbit their common center of mass, so the sum of their velocities is the same as the orbital speed multiplied by the number of orbits per unit time. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, the orbital period P is the same for both stars, which is given as the eclipse period. So for system_1, P=2 years, system_2, P=1 year.

The formula I recall for the mass function is f(m) = ( (v^3 P) ) / (2 π G ), where v is the velocity of one star. But since we have two velocities, perhaps we can relate them.

Wait, another formula: the mass of the companion can be found using the fact that M2 = (m1 * v1) / v2. Because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 → M2 = m1 * (v1/v2). But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the ratio of the masses of the two systems.

So, the total mass of each system is the sum of the individual masses. And for each system, the masses are in the ratio of their velocities in reverse.

So for system_1:

masses are m1 = 0.5 m2 (from earlier). So M1_total = m1 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly, system_2:

masses M1 = (2/3) M2. So M2_total = (5/3) M2.

Now, the question is: by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So M1_total / M2_total.

But I can't compute that ratio directly because I don't know how m2 (from system_1) relates to M2 (from system_2). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that the period is related to the masses and the size of the orbit.

In a binary system, the period P is related to the orbital separation a and the masses m1 and m2 by Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² / G (m1 + m2)) ) * a³.

But without knowing a, the separation, it's tricky. But maybe I can find the ratio of the masses without knowing the absolute values.

Wait, another approach. Since we have the periods and the velocity amplitudes, perhaps we can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

The formula for the total mass in a binary system can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

Wait, each star's velocity is v1 and v2. The total velocity K is v1 + v2. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful.

Alternatively, the sum of the velocities (v1 + v2) is equal to (2 π a) / P, where a is the separation between the two stars. Because each star orbits the center of mass, so together, their separation is a, and their velocities are proportional to their distances from the center.

So, v1 = (2 π a1) / P, v2 = (2 π a2) / P. And a1 + a2 = a (the separation).

So, a1 = (v1 * P) / (2 π), a2 = (v2 * P)/(2 π). And a1 + a2 = a = (P (v1 + v2)) / (2 π).

Now, using Kepler's third law for the binary system:

P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G (m1 + m2) )

Rewriting a in terms of velocities:

a = (P (v1 + v2)) / (2 π )

So substituting into Kepler's law:

P² = (4 π² [ (P (v1 + v2)/(2 π) )³ ]) / ( G (m1 + m2) )

Let's simplify this.

P² = [4 π² * (P³ (v1 + v2)^3) ) / (8 π^3) ) ] / ( G (m1 + m2) )

Simplify numerator:

4 π² * P³ (v1 + v2)^3 / (8 π^3 ) → [4/(8)] [ π² / π^3 ] * P³ (v1 + v2)^3 → (0.5) (1/ π) P³ (v1 +v2)^3.

So, P² = [ (0.5 P³ (v1 + v2)^3 ) / ( π G (m1 + m2) ) ) ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

P² * π G (m1 + m2) ) = 0.5 P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 )

Divide both sides by P²:

π G (m1 + m2) ) = 0.5 P (v1 + v2)^3 )

Then,

m1 + m2 = [ 0.5 P (v1 + v2)^3 ) ] / ( π G )

Which can be written as:

(m1 + m2) = [ P (v1 + v2)^3 ] / ( 2 π G )

So, that's the formula for the total mass of the binary system.

So, for system_1 and system_2, their total masses can be calculated as:

M1_total = [ P1 (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 ] / (2 π G )

M2_total = [ P2 (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 ] / (2 π G )

Since both have the same G and the same denominator, the ratio M1_total / M2_total is:

[ P1 (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 ] / [ P2 (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 ]

So, we can compute this ratio.

Let me plug in the numbers.

For system_1:

P1 = 2 years.

v1_1 =10 km/s, v2_1=5 km/s. So v_sum1 =15 km/s.

So numerator for system_1: 2 * (15)^3.

For system_2:

P2=1 year.

v1_2=15, v2_2=10. v_sum2 =25.

Denominator for system_2: 1 * (25)^3.

So the ratio is (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3 )

Compute 15^3: 3375.

25^3: 15625.

So ratio = (2 * 3375) / 15625 = (6750) / 15625.

Compute 6750 /15625.

Let me divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

270 ÷625 = 0.432.

So the ratio M1_total / M2_total is approximately 0.432.

Wait, but wait. The question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2. So system_2 is more massive. But the question is how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. So if the ratio is 0.432, that would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Or, system_2 is about 2.3 times more massive than system_1.

Wait, no, the ratio M1_total / M2_total is 0.432, so M1 = 0.432 * M2. So M1 is about 0.43 times M2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. That is, system_1's mass is how many times that of system_2.

So 0.43 times, which is approximately 0.4, which is option A.

Wait, but wait the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So the answer would be A) 0.4.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Compute 15^3: 15*15=225; 225*15=3375. Correct.

25^3: 25*25=625; 625*25=15625.

So, (2 * 3375) = 6750.

6750 /15625 = ?

Let me compute 15625 × 0.4 = 6250.

6750 is 500 more. 500 is 6250 - 500 = 5750. Wait, sorry, no. Let me compute 0.4 ×15625=6250.

6750 -6250 =500.

500 is 500/15625 = 0.032.

So 0.4 + 0.032 = 0.432. So 0.432, which is approximately 0.43.

So the factor is about 0.43, which is close to option A) ~0.4.

But let me check if I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula I used: M_total = (P (v1 + v2)^3 ) / (2 π G )

So the ratio is [ (P1 (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 ) ] / [ (P2 (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 ) ]

Which is correct because the denominators (2 π G) are same and cancel when taking the ratio.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the ratio is 0.432, which is about 0.4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the period for system_1 is longer (2 years) compared to system_2 (1 year). So if system_1 has a longer period, but perhaps the velocities are lower, how does that affect the mass?

Alternatively, another approach: the ratio M1_total / M2_total is (P1 (v1 +v2)^3 for system1) / (P2 (v1+v2)^3 for system2)

So system_1:

P1=2, (15)^3=3375 → 2 *3375=6750.

System_2: P2=1, (25)^3=15625 → 1*15625=15625.

Ratio: 6750 /15625 = 0.432.

Yes, same as before.

So the factor is approximately 0.4, so system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2. So system_2 is more massive.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is 0.4. So option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between the total mass of a binary system, its orbital period, and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its stars. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = \frac{P (v_1 + v_2)^3}{2 \pi G}
\]

where \(P\) is the orbital period, \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since \(G\) and the denominator \(2 \pi\) are constants, the ratio of the total masses of the two systems can be simplified to:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{P_1 (v_{1,1} + v_{2,1})^3}{P_2 (v_{1,2} + v_{2,2})^3}
\]

### Step 1: System_1
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(v_{\text{sum,1}} = v_{1,1} + v_{2,1} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Contribution to the mass ratio: \(P_1 (v_{\text{sum,1}})^3 = 2 \cdot 15^3 = 2 \cdot 3375 = 6750\)

### Step 2: System_2
- Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(v_{\text{sum,2}} = v_{1,2} + v_{2,2} = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Contribution to the mass ratio: \(P_2 (v_{\text{sum,2}})^3 = 1 \cdot 25^3 = 1 \cdot 15625 = 15625\)

### Step 3: Compute the Mass Ratio
The ratio of the total masses is:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{6750}{15625}
\]

Simplify the ratio:

\[
\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The ratio \(M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 0.432\) indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. Thus, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.4.

### Final Answer
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is closest to **0.4**.

**Answer: A**
