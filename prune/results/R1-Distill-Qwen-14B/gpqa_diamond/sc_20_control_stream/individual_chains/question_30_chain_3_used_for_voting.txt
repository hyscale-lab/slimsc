Okay, so I've got this question about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, I remember that when materials absorb certain wavelengths of light, they emit others, right? The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. And I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I think this has something to do with the energy levels and the electromagnetic spectrum. Oh right! When a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between electrons in different energy levels. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, that emission is due to electrons dropping from a higher energy state to a lower one. But what's the absorbed light?

I remember that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. Because when the electron gets excited, it absorbs energy to jump to a higher level, and then when it drops back, it emits energy as light. So the absorbed energy should be higher than the emitted energy.

So, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me think about the energy of different colors. I know that visible light has various colors, each with different energies. Violet and blue are higher energy, then green, yellow, orange, red. So higher energy means shorter wavelength (like violet) and lower energy means longer wavelength (like red).

So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than 2.3393 eV. Let me see, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow. Oh, wait, the colors go from red (lowest energy) to violet (highest). So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, what's that in terms of color?

I think I remember that 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 nm wavelength. So 2.3393 eV would be 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. Wait, 530 nm is in the green range. But wait, the question says that the dye emits this light. So if the emission is green, then the absorption must be at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green.

Wait, but what's the connection between the absorbed and emitted wavelengths? The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the higher energy level and the lower one. So when the electron is in the higher energy level, it might have been excited by absorbing a photon. Then, when it drops, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference, but maybe not the same as the absorbed one.

Wait, no. Oh, wait, the emission is when the electron drops from an excited state to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between those two states. But how does that relate to the absorbed photon? Because the absorbed photon would have provided the energy to jump from the ground state to the excited state. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The process is: the molecule absorbs a photon (with energy E_abs), which excites an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, the electron relaxes, emitting a photon (E_emit) as it drops to a lower level, but not necessarily the same level. So E_abs is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. E_emit is the difference between the excited state and the next lower state.

Wait, but if the molecule has multiple energy levels, maybe the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed one. Because it's dropping from a higher level to a lower one, but not necessarily all the way back to the ground state. So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

So in this problem, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

So what color corresponds to higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let's calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, maybe it's easier to use the shortcut 1240 eV·nm.

So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. That's around green light. So the emitted light is green. But the absorbed light must be higher energy, so the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. Let's see, which color is that?

The visible spectrum is roughly: red (620-750 nm), orange (590-620), yellow (570-590), green (495-570), blue (450-495), violet (380-450). Oh wait, I think I got the ranges a bit off. Let me think again. The order from longer to shorter wavelength is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.

So 530 nm is green. The absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, so higher energy. So the absorbed light could be blue or violet. Let's look at the options: the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed light is either violet or blue. The question is, which option is correct.

Wait, but the question asks what color is absorbed. So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV (green), which would mean it absorbed light with higher energy. Let's see, what's the energy of violet and blue.

Violet is about 400-440 nm. Let's compute the energy for 400 nm.

E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Blue is around 450 nm, so E is about 1240/450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), then the absorbed energy would be higher than that, so either blue (2.76 eV) or violet (3.1 eV) or something else.

Wait, the options are violet and blue as possible answers. So which one is it?

I think that the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher. So the dye would absorb light with higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So in the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.76 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but the question is, what color is absorbed. So which of the options is the correct one?

Or, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. So when it absorbs light, it's using that energy to get excited, and then it emits a photon. But wait, perhaps this is fluorescence or something else.

Wait, in fluorescence, the material absorbs higher energy light and emits lower energy. So if it emits at 2.3393 eV (green), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like blue or violet.

So which option is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV?

Looking at the colors and their approximate energies:

Red: ~1.65 eV (700 nm)
Orange: ~2 eV (620 nm)
Yellow: ~2.1 eV (570 nm)
Green: ~2.3 eV (530 nm)
Blue: ~2.76 eV (450 nm)
Violet: ~3.1 eV (400 nm)

So both blue and violet have higher energy than green.

So the question is, which of the options is the color absorbed. So the options are A) Red (lower than 2.3393, so not), B) Violet (higher), C) Blue (higher), D) Yellow (lower than 2.3393? Wait, wait yellow is ~2.1 eV, which is lower than 2.3393. So the absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted.

So the options are B and C. So which is correct?

Wait, the question is about the color that's absorbed. So the dye must absorb a higher energy photon than it emits. So 2.3393 eV is emitted. So the absorption is at higher energy than that.

So the possible options are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.76 eV). So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the complementary color. The color that's emitted is green (530 nm), so the absorbed color is the complementary one. Wait, I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, I thought that if a dye emits green, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta (a combination of red and blue). But the options don't include magenta. So perhaps that's not the right approach here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed is either blue or violet.

Let me recall. When a molecule absorbs light, the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state. Then, when it emits, it drops to a lower state, so the emitted photon has energy equal to the difference between the excited state and the lower state.

So in some cases, the emitted photon's energy could be less than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon is higher. So the absorption is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region.

Now, looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.76 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed by the organic compound. So which of these is the correct answer?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a formula or a relation.

Energy and wavelength are inversely proportional (E ∝ 1/λ). So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength, which is violet or blue in this case.

So the options are B and C. But how to choose between them.

Wait another approach: the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is E_abs. The molecule may emit a photon when dropping from the excited state to a lower state, say intermediate state, with energy E_emit = E_excited - E_intermediate.

But in this problem, it's given that the emission is 2.3393 eV. So E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So E_abs = E_excited - E_ground. But without knowing E_ground or E_intermediate, it's hard to get E_abs.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule emits the same energy as the absorbed? No, that's not possible because it's emitting when it relaxes, not necessarily the same energy.

Wait, maybe in some cases, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, but emits a lower energy one. For example, a fluorescent lamp absorbs UV and emits visible light.

So in this case, the dye emits green (2.3393 eV), so it must absorb higher energy. So the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Thus, the options are either B) Violet (3.1 eV) or C) Blue (2.76 eV).

But the question is, which color is absorbed? So the correct answer is either B or C.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I need to think about the position of the emission in the spectrum.

Wait, wait, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region, right? Because the longer the conjugation, the longer the wavelength (lower energy) of the absorbed light.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, more conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. Because the energy gap decreases as the conjugation length increases.

So, for a highly conjugated system, the absorption is in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum.

Wait, but that's about the absorption, not the emission. Hmm, but in this question, the emission is given.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted one. So if the molecule is emitting green (2.3393 eV), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, perhaps blue or violet.

But the conjugated pi system being extensive suggests that the absorption is in the visible, perhaps in the longer wavelength (lower energy) end. So if the conjugation is extensive, maybe the absorption is in the red or blue?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of some examples. For instance, beta-carotene has an extensively conjugated system and absorbs in the blue region, appearing orange because it reflects the complementary color (yellow-green), but emits when excited.

Alternatively, when a molecule with extensive conjugation absorbs light, the excited state is lower in energy than a highly conjugated system. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just rely on the energy calculation. Since the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher. So the possible options are B and C.

But which one? Because the question is which color is absorbed, so the answer must be either B or C.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the emission and some higher state.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy levels, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the color that is absorbed, given that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So that would require knowing what color corresponds to a higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.76 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

So which is the correct answer?

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Since energy and wavelength are inversely proportional, the absorbed photon's wavelength must be shorter than 530 nm (green).

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the absorbed color would have a higher energy, so it's either blue or violet.

But which is it? I think that in such cases, the absorbed photon is in the ultraviolet or blue/violet region.

Wait, but the options don't include ultraviolet. So the answer must be either B or C.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and see where it lies. 1240/2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green, which means it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed color is either violet or blue.

So the options are B and C. But the question is multiple-choice, so I have to choose between them.

Hmm. Let me think about this. Blue light is around 450 nm, which gives about 2.76 eV. Violet is around 400 nm, which is about 3.1 eV.

The question is about the color absorbed. So if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be higher, like blue or violet.

But without more information, how do I choose between B and C?

Wait, another thought: the energy required to make the electron jump is the absorption energy. If the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption must be higher. So, both B and C are higher. But the question is, which color is the absorbed one.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is blue, because it's one of the options. Or is it violet?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the fact that the emitted color is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum, so the absorbed is probably violet or blue. But without knowing, I can't be certain.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference between absorption and emission is the energy gap. So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon has higher energy.

But in the options, blue is 2.76 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So blue is an option. So that would make the absorbed color blue.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the dye emits at 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so blue (2.76) and violet (3.1) are options.

Wait, but I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, another point: when a molecule emits light, it's usually at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed. So if the emission is green, the absorption would be in the blue or violet.

But which one?

Alternatively, perhaps the conjugated system leads to absorption in the blue region. Since the question says it's extensively conjugated, which tends to absorb in the longer wavelengths. Hmm, but that's for absorption in the ground state. Wait, for extended conjugation, the absorption shifts to longer wavelengths (lower energy), like from UV to visible.

Wait, when a molecule has a longer conjugation, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO decreases, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So if the molecule is highly conjugated, it would absorb in the visible range, perhaps in the blue or even green.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule emits green. So the absorption is higher energy than that. So if the molecule's absorption is in the blue or violet, which is higher than green.

Wait, but if the molecule has a large conjugated system, maybe it absorbs in the red or near infrared. But that's for the absorption, not the emission.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe the key is to realize that the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Therefore, the options are B and C. But which one is it?

Wait, the question gives four options, with B being violet and C blue. The emitted light is green, so the absorbed must be higher than that.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the wavelengths for the options.

Option B: Violet ~400 nm → E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue ~450 nm → E ≈ 2.76 eV.

The emitted light is at ~530 nm (2.3393 eV). So the absorbed photon must be at a shorter wavelength, higher energy.

So options B and C are viable.

But how to choose between them? Since both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, maybe the question is trying to get me to know that the absorbed light is complementary to the emitted color. Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue/violet. So perhaps the absorbed color would be in the blue or violet range.

But without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to be precise.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy difference. If the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, and the absorbed is, say, 2.76 eV (blue), that's a difference of about 0.42 eV. That might correspond to a small energy gap, which is possible.

Alternatively, if the absorbed is 3.1 eV (violet), the difference is 0.76 eV. That's also possible.

Wait, but I don't think that's the way to go. Maybe the key is to know that the emitted light's energy is in the green, so the absorbed is in the blue or violet.

Wait, but without more data, how can I decide?

Wait, another thought: the energy levels. The energy gap for absorption may be larger than the emission. So the absorption is at a higher energy, but maybe it's in the blue region.

Alternatively, I think the correct approach is to realize that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed is higher. So the correct answer must be either B or C.

But the options are:

A) Red (lower, so not)

B) Violet (higher)

C) Blue (higher)

D) Yellow (lower)

So the correct options are B and C.

But the question is, which is the correct answer. I think I'm missing some key point here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, which is the complementary color of the emitted. The complementary color of green is magenta. But magenta is not an option. So perhaps the absorbed color is in the blue or violet.

But without more details, it's difficult. Given that, I think the best option is to go with the higher energy color, which is violet.

Wait, but another approach: the visible spectrum's order. Violet is the highest energy, followed by blue, then green, etc.

So the absorbed photon must be violet or blue. Which of these is higher than 2.3393 eV?

Both are, but 3.1 eV (violet) is higher than 2.76 (blue), which is higher than 2.3393.

So between B and C, the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: in the case of a dye, the color absorbed is the one that is not transmitted or reflected. So if the dye emits green, it must be absorbing the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta, so perhaps the closest is blue or violet.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C) Blue, because blue is higher in energy than green.

Wait, another angle: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. So the question is, which color from the options is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Looking at the energy levels of the options:

Red: ~1.65 eV (no)

Violet: ~3.1 eV (yes)

Blue: ~2.76 eV (yes)

Yellow: ~2.1 eV (no)

So the possible answers are B and C.

But how to choose between them. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the energy difference between the absorption and emission can be related to the energy levels. If the molecule absorbs blue light (2.76 eV) and emits green (2.3393 eV), the energy difference is 0.42 eV, which may correspond to some vibrational or rotational energy levels. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, if it absorbed violet light (3.1 eV) and emitted green, the energy difference is 0.76 eV, which is larger. But that's also possible.

But without knowing the exact structure of the dye, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another thought: in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is usually lower than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

In this case, the emitted is green, so the absorbed is either blue or violet.

Hmm, I think the correct answer is B) Violet.

But wait, another way: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is approximately 530 nm. The absorbed photon must have a higher energy. So, options B and C.

But without more info, I can't be sure. I think I'll have to make a choice based on the possible energies. Let me think about the numbers.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV.

The energy of blue is 2.76 eV, which is roughly 2.76 - 2.3393 = 0.42 eV higher. That's a small energy gap.

Violet is 3.1 - 2.3393 = 0.76 eV higher. That's a larger gap.

In fluorescence, the energy difference can vary, but I think the absorbed photon is usually in the same region as the emission, but higher.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the emitted photon as the same as the absorbed. No, that can't be because the emitted is lower energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula E = hc/λ, and think about the possible colors.

But given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed to give the answer as B) Violet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the absorbed and emitted photons. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). The absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon because the energy of the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon results from the relaxation of the molecule to a lower energy state.

The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, meaning higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths. The visible spectrum ranges from red (longer wavelength, lower energy) to violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy). For the given options:

- **Red (A):** Approximately 1.65 eV (700 nm) — lower energy than 2.3393 eV, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.
- **Violet (B):** Approximately 3.1 eV (400 nm) — higher energy than 2.3393 eV, making it a plausible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **Blue (C):** Approximately 2.76 eV (450 nm) — higher energy than 2.3393 eV, also a plausible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **Yellow (D):** Approximately 2.1 eV (570 nm) — lower energy than 2.3393 eV, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.

Both violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.76 eV) have higher energy than the emitted green light (2.3393 eV). However, violet light has a significantly higher energy gap compared to blue light. While both are plausible, the question does not provide additional details to distinguish between them. Based on the reasoning and the higher energy of violet light, the most likely answer is **violet**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this question about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, I remember that when materials absorb certain wavelengths of light, they emit others, right? The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. And I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I think this has something to do with the energy levels and the electromagnetic spectrum. Oh right! When a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between electrons in different energy levels. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, that emission is due to electrons dropping from a higher energy state to a lower one. But what's the absorbed light?

I remember that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. Because when the electron gets excited, it absorbs energy to jump to a higher level, and then when it drops back, it emits energy as light. So the absorbed energy should be higher than the emitted energy.

So, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me think about the energy of different colors. I know that visible light has various colors, each with different energies. Violet and blue are higher energy, then green, yellow, orange, red. So higher energy means shorter wavelength (like violet) and lower energy means longer wavelength (like red).

So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than 2.3393 eV. Let me see, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow. Oh, wait, the colors go from red (lowest energy) to violet (highest). So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, what's that in terms of color?

I think I remember that 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 nm wavelength. So 2.3393 eV would be 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. Wait, 530 nm is in the green range. But wait, the question says that the dye emits this light. So if the emission is green, then the absorption must be at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green.

Wait, but what's the connection between the absorbed and emitted wavelengths? The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the higher energy level and the lower one. So when the electron is in the higher energy level, it might have been excited by absorbing a photon. Then, when it drops, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference, but maybe not the same as the absorbed one.

Wait, no. Oh, wait, the emission is when the electron drops from an excited state to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between those two states. But how does that relate to the absorbed photon? Because the absorbed photon would have provided the energy to jump from the ground state to the excited state. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The process is: the molecule absorbs a photon (with energy E_abs), which excites an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, the electron relaxes, emitting a photon (E_emit) as it drops to a lower level, but not necessarily the same level. So E_abs is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. E_emit is the difference between the excited state and the next lower state.

Wait, but if the molecule has multiple energy levels, maybe the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed one. Because it's dropping from a higher level to a lower one, but not necessarily all the way back to the ground state. So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

So in this problem, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

So what color corresponds to higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Let's calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, maybe it's easier to use the shortcut 1240 eV·nm.

So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. That's around green light. So the emitted light is green. But the absorbed light must be higher energy, so the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. Let's see, which color is that?

The visible spectrum is roughly: red (620-750 nm), orange (590-620), yellow (570-590), green (495-570), blue (450-495), violet (380-450). Oh wait, I think I got the ranges a bit off. Let me think again. The order from longer to shorter wavelength is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.

So 530 nm is green. The absorbed wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, so higher energy. So the absorbed light could be blue or violet. Let's look at the options: the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed light is either violet or blue. The question is, which option is correct.

Wait, but the question asks what color is absorbed. So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV (green), which would mean it absorbed light with higher energy. Let's see, what's the energy of violet and blue.

Violet is about 400-440 nm. Let's compute the energy for 400 nm.

E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Blue is around 450 nm, so E is about 1240/450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), then the absorbed energy would be higher than that, so either blue (2.76 eV) or violet (3.1 eV) or something else.

Wait, the options are violet and blue as possible answers. So which one is it?

I think that the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher. So the dye would absorb light with higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So in the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.76 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but the question is, what color is absorbed. So which of the options is the correct one?

Or, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. So when it absorbs light, it's using that energy to get excited, and then it emits a photon. But wait, perhaps this is fluorescence or something else.

Wait, in fluorescence, the material absorbs higher energy light and emits lower energy. So if it emits at 2.3393 eV (green), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, like blue or violet.

So which option is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV?

Looking at the colors and their approximate energies:

Red: ~1.65 eV (700 nm)
Orange: ~2 eV (620 nm)
Yellow: ~2.1 eV (570 nm)
Green: ~2.3 eV (530 nm)
Blue: ~2.76 eV (450 nm)
Violet: ~3.1 eV (400 nm)

So both blue and violet have higher energy than green.

So the question is, which of the options is the color absorbed. So the options are A) Red (lower than 2.3393, so not), B) Violet (higher), C) Blue (higher), D) Yellow (lower than 2.3393? Wait, wait yellow is ~2.1 eV, which is lower than 2.3393. So the absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted.

So the options are B and C. So which is correct?

Wait, the question is about the color that's absorbed. So the dye must absorb a higher energy photon than it emits. So 2.3393 eV is emitted. So the absorption is at higher energy than that.

So the possible options are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.76 eV). So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the complementary color. The color that's emitted is green (530 nm), so the absorbed color is the complementary one. Wait, I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, I thought that if a dye emits green, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta (a combination of red and blue). But the options don't include magenta. So perhaps that's not the right approach here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed is either blue or violet.

Let me recall. When a molecule absorbs light, the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state. Then, when it emits, it drops to a lower state, so the emitted photon has energy equal to the difference between the excited state and the lower state.

So in some cases, the emitted photon's energy could be less than the absorbed.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon is higher. So the absorption is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region.

Now, looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.76 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed by the organic compound. So which of these is the correct answer?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a formula or a relation.

Energy and wavelength are inversely proportional (E ∝ 1/λ). So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength, which is violet or blue in this case.

So the options are B and C. But how to choose between them.

Wait another approach: the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is E_abs. The molecule may emit a photon when dropping from the excited state to a lower state, say intermediate state, with energy E_emit = E_excited - E_intermediate.

But in this problem, it's given that the emission is 2.3393 eV. So E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So E_abs = E_excited - E_ground. But without knowing E_ground or E_intermediate, it's hard to get E_abs.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule emits the same energy as the absorbed? No, that's not possible because it's emitting when it relaxes, not necessarily the same energy.

Wait, maybe in some cases, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, but emits a lower energy one. For example, a fluorescent lamp absorbs UV and emits visible light.

So in this case, the dye emits green (2.3393 eV), so it must absorb higher energy. So the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Thus, the options are either B) Violet (3.1 eV) or C) Blue (2.76 eV).

But the question is, which color is absorbed? So the correct answer is either B or C.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I need to think about the position of the emission in the spectrum.

Wait, wait, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region, right? Because the longer the conjugation, the longer the wavelength (lower energy) of the absorbed light.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, more conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. Because the energy gap decreases as the conjugation length increases.

So, for a highly conjugated system, the absorption is in the longer wavelength (lower energy) part of the spectrum.

Wait, but that's about the absorption, not the emission. Hmm, but in this question, the emission is given.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the absorbed photon is higher energy than the emitted one. So if the molecule is emitting green (2.3393 eV), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, perhaps blue or violet.

But the conjugated pi system being extensive suggests that the absorption is in the visible, perhaps in the longer wavelength (lower energy) end. So if the conjugation is extensive, maybe the absorption is in the red or blue?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of some examples. For instance, beta-carotene has an extensively conjugated system and absorbs in the blue region, appearing orange because it reflects the complementary color (yellow-green), but emits when excited.

Alternatively, when a molecule with extensive conjugation absorbs light, the excited state is lower in energy than a highly conjugated system. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just rely on the energy calculation. Since the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher. So the possible options are B and C.

But which one? Because the question is which color is absorbed, so the answer must be either B or C.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the emission and some higher state.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy levels, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the color that is absorbed, given that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So that would require knowing what color corresponds to a higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.76 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

So which is the correct answer?

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Since energy and wavelength are inversely proportional, the absorbed photon's wavelength must be shorter than 530 nm (green).

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the absorbed color would have a higher energy, so it's either blue or violet.

But which is it? I think that in such cases, the absorbed photon is in the ultraviolet or blue/violet region.

Wait, but the options don't include ultraviolet. So the answer must be either B or C.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and see where it lies. 1240/2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green, which means it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed color is either violet or blue.

So the options are B and C. But the question is multiple-choice, so I have to choose between them.

Hmm. Let me think about this. Blue light is around 450 nm, which gives about 2.76 eV. Violet is around 400 nm, which is about 3.1 eV.

The question is about the color absorbed. So if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be higher, like blue or violet.

But without more information, how do I choose between B and C?

Wait, another thought: the energy required to make the electron jump is the absorption energy. If the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption must be higher. So, both B and C are higher. But the question is, which color is the absorbed one.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is blue, because it's one of the options. Or is it violet?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the fact that the emitted color is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum, so the absorbed is probably violet or blue. But without knowing, I can't be certain.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference between absorption and emission is the energy gap. So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon has higher energy.

But in the options, blue is 2.76 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So blue is an option. So that would make the absorbed color blue.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the dye emits at 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so blue (2.76) and violet (3.1) are options.

Wait, but I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, another point: when a molecule emits light, it's usually at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed. So if the emission is green, the absorption would be in the blue or violet.

But which one?

Alternatively, perhaps the conjugated system leads to absorption in the blue region. Since the question says it's extensively conjugated, which tends to absorb in the longer wavelengths. Hmm, but that's for absorption in the ground state. Wait, for extended conjugation, the absorption shifts to longer wavelengths (lower energy), like from UV to visible.

Wait, when a molecule has a longer conjugation, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO decreases, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So if the molecule is highly conjugated, it would absorb in the visible range, perhaps in the blue or even green.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule emits green. So the absorption is higher energy than that. So if the molecule's absorption is in the blue or violet, which is higher than green.

Wait, but if the molecule has a large conjugated system, maybe it absorbs in the red or near infrared. But that's for the absorption, not the emission.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe the key is to realize that the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Therefore, the options are B and C. But which one is it?

Wait, the question gives four options, with B being violet and C blue. The emitted light is green, so the absorbed must be higher than that.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the wavelengths for the options.

Option B: Violet ~400 nm → E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue ~450 nm → E ≈ 2.76 eV.

The emitted light is at ~530 nm (2.3393 eV). So the absorbed photon must be at a shorter wavelength, higher energy.

So options B and C are viable.

But how to choose between them? Since both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, maybe the question is trying to get me to know that the absorbed light is complementary to the emitted color. Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue/violet. So perhaps the absorbed color would be in the blue or violet range.

But without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to be precise.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy difference. If the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, and the absorbed is, say, 2.76 eV (blue), that's a difference of about 0.42 eV. That might correspond to a small energy gap, which is possible.

Alternatively, if the absorbed is 3.1 eV (violet), the difference is 0.76 eV. That's also possible.

Wait, but I don't think that's the way to go. Maybe the key is to know that the emitted light's energy is in the green, so the absorbed is in the blue or violet.

Wait, but without more data, how can I decide?

Wait, another thought: the energy levels. The energy gap for absorption may be larger than the emission. So the absorption is at a higher energy, but maybe it's in the blue region.

Alternatively, I think the correct approach is to realize that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed is higher. So the correct answer must be either B or C.

But the options are:

A) Red (lower, so not)

B) Violet (higher)

C) Blue (higher)

D) Yellow (lower)

So the correct options are B and C.

But the question is, which is the correct answer. I think I'm missing some key point here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color absorbed, which is the complementary color of the emitted. The complementary color of green is magenta. But magenta is not an option. So perhaps the absorbed color is in the blue or violet.

But without more details, it's difficult. Given that, I think the best option is to go with the higher energy color, which is violet.

Wait, but another approach: the visible spectrum's order. Violet is the highest energy, followed by blue, then green, etc.

So the absorbed photon must be violet or blue. Which of these is higher than 2.3393 eV?

Both are, but 3.1 eV (violet) is higher than 2.76 (blue), which is higher than 2.3393.

So between B and C, the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: in the case of a dye, the color absorbed is the one that is not transmitted or reflected. So if the dye emits green, it must be absorbing the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta, so perhaps the closest is blue or violet.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C) Blue, because blue is higher in energy than green.

Wait, another angle: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. So the question is, which color from the options is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Looking at the energy levels of the options:

Red: ~1.65 eV (no)

Violet: ~3.1 eV (yes)

Blue: ~2.76 eV (yes)

Yellow: ~2.1 eV (no)

So the possible answers are B and C.

But how to choose between them. Maybe the correct answer is B) Violet.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the energy difference between the absorption and emission can be related to the energy levels. If the molecule absorbs blue light (2.76 eV) and emits green (2.3393 eV), the energy difference is 0.42 eV, which may correspond to some vibrational or rotational energy levels. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, if it absorbed violet light (3.1 eV) and emitted green, the energy difference is 0.76 eV, which is larger. But that's also possible.

But without knowing the exact structure of the dye, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another thought: in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is usually lower than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

In this case, the emitted is green, so the absorbed is either blue or violet.

Hmm, I think the correct answer is B) Violet.

But wait, another way: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is approximately 530 nm. The absorbed photon must have a higher energy. So, options B and C.

But without more info, I can't be sure. I think I'll have to make a choice based on the possible energies. Let me think about the numbers.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV.

The energy of blue is 2.76 eV, which is roughly 2.76 - 2.3393 = 0.42 eV higher. That's a small energy gap.

Violet is 3.1 - 2.3393 = 0.76 eV higher. That's a larger gap.

In fluorescence, the energy difference can vary, but I think the absorbed photon is usually in the same region as the emission, but higher.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the emitted photon as the same as the absorbed. No, that can't be because the emitted is lower energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula E = hc/λ, and think about the possible colors.

But given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed to give the answer as B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the absorbed and emitted photons. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). The absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon because the energy of the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon results from the relaxation of the molecule to a lower energy state.

The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, meaning higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths. The visible spectrum ranges from red (longer wavelength, lower energy) to violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy). For the given options:

- **Red (A):** Approximately 1.65 eV (700 nm) — lower energy than 2.3393 eV, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.
- **Violet (B):** Approximately 3.1 eV (400 nm) — higher energy than 2.3393 eV, making it a plausible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **Blue (C):** Approximately 2.76 eV (450 nm) — higher energy than 2.3393 eV, also a plausible candidate for the absorbed photon.
- **Yellow (D):** Approximately 2.1 eV (570 nm) — lower energy than 2.3393 eV, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.

Both violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.76 eV) have higher energy than the emitted green light (2.3393 eV). However, violet light has a significantly higher energy gap compared to blue light. While both are plausible, the question does not provide additional details to distinguish between them. Based on the reasoning and the higher energy of violet light, the most likely answer is **violet**.

Answer: B
