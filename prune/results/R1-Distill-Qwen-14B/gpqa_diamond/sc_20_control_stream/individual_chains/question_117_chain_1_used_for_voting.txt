Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism, or what I think is also called optical activity. The question is asking which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. When a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

Looking at the question, there are four compounds listed, and four options. I need to figure out which of these compounds have the possibility of having chiral centers, leading to optical isomerism.

Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, this seems a bit complex. So, biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and the nitro groups are at 6 and 6' positions. The formula is such that each benzene ring has a substituent. Wait, but what about the substituents on the central carbon? The structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 positions. Now, the 2 positions on each ring have a carbonyl group (since it's a dicarboxylate ester). So, each of those carbons attached to the ester groups would have what?

Wait, the structure is of the form O-CO-OCH3 (since it's dimethyl ester, so two methyl ester groups). So, the central carbons are each attached to the biphenyl rings, a carbonyl group, and two more groups? Hmm, maybe each of those carbons is part of a benzene ring, but perhaps the central carbon (the one attached to the benzene rings) isn't a chiral center. Wait, no, let me think. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene. So each benzene has a substituent at position 2, which is part of a dicarboxylate ester group. So each of these carbons (the ones attached to the ester) would be connected to the benzene ring, the ester oxygen, and two other groups? Wait, no. Each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. So, the structure is something like each benzene has a group at position 2: -COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions. And 2,2'-dicarboxylate, which is the ester groups. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6, and the ester group at 2.

Wait, but the main structure is biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected via a single bond. So the positions are 2 and 2' on each ring. Each of those positions has a COOCH3 group. Now, the question is whether any of the atoms in the structure have four different groups attached.

Looking at the central atoms: the biphenyl's central carbon is connected to two benzene rings. But wait, each benzene is connected to this central carbon. So each of those carbons (the ones attached to the benzene rings) is part of the rings, so they're sp² hybridized, meaning they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different groups attached. Wait, but the other parts: the ester groups at 2 and 2' positions. Each of those carbons (the ones attached to the COOCH3) are connected to the benzene, two oxygen atoms (from the ester), and another group? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the key is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it's symmetric, then maybe it's not chiral. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is meso, then no optical isomerism. So, for compound 1, the substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and ester groups at 2 and 2'. So, the molecule is symmetric because the substituents are in positions that mirror each other. So the entire molecule might be symmetrical, making it not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a chiral center.

Wait, each of the 2 and 2' positions have the ester groups. So the carbons at 2 and 2' are each connected to the benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and two other groups. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to the benzene. So, each of those carbons is part of the benzene, so they're sp² hybridized, which can't be chiral centers.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a double bond elsewhere that could lead to geometric isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So, taking compound 1, it's a biphenyl with substituents in 2 and 6 positions on each ring. If the substituents are symmetrical, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So, not an option.

Moving on to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But wait, it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the structure is HOCH2COOCH3? Wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2(CH2)COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, right? So, propanoate would be CH3CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-? But wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CO-OCH2CH2-OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)- something? Wait, perhaps the structure is more like methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? Or wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HO-CH2-COOH. Yes, that makes sense. So the methyl ester would be HO-CH2-CO-OCH3. So, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH.

Wait, but wait: the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. So, the carbon adjacent to the ester oxygen is CH2-OH. So, looking at that carbon, let's see what groups are attached. The CH2-OH group is attached to the ester (O-CO-OCH3) on one side and the OH on the other. Wait, the CH2 is connected to the COOCH3 group and the OH. So, the carbon here is CH2-OH. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. So the CH2-OH is a -CH2-OH group, attached to the carbonyl. So the carbon in the middle (the CH2) is connected to:

1. The carbonyl oxygen (from the ester group)
2. The hydroxyl group (OH)
3. Two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the structure properly. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the propanoate is the conjugate base of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH? No, wait, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, if it's 2-hydroxy, the structure is HOCH2COOH. So the methyl ester is HOCH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is HOCH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one attached to the COOCH3) is connected to:

- One -CH2-OH group,
- One -COOCH3 group,
- And two more hydrogens.

Wait, no, the structure would be:

HO-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the carbon in the middle (the CH2) is attached to:

1. The HO- group,
2. The COOCH3 group,
3. Two H's.

Wait, so that makes three groups and two H's. So four substituents? No, the carbon is a CH2, so it's CH2-OH connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

So, the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl and the ester. Let me count the groups attached to that central carbon. The central carbon (let's call it C2) is attached to:

1. The hydroxyl group (OH),
2. The carbonyl group (COOCH3),
3. Two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that's three groups. Because the structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- One COOCH3,
- One OH,
- Two H's.

So, that's four substituents: COOCH3, OH, H, H. Wait, but two of them are H's. So, the central carbon is attached to two identical H's, so it can't be a chiral center. Because for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So, in this case, the substituents are COOCH3, OH, H, and H. So, since two substituents are the same (H), it's not a chiral center. So, this compound wouldn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait—am I missing something? Because sometimes in such structures, the configuration can lead to a chiral center elsewhere.

Hmm, alternative approach: maybe the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl is a chiral center. Let me think. The structure is HO-CH2-CO-OCH3. The carbon next to the hydroxyl (CH2) is attached to:

- HO-,
- CH2-,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again about the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

Here, the central carbon (the one attached to the COOCH3) is the same as the CH2-OH's carbon. Wait, no. Let me write the structure correctly. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH? Or HOCH2COOH? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the 2-position would be the middle CH2. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the CH2 in the middle) is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups,
- a COOCH3 group,
- and an OH group.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. No, wait, wait. Let me get the correct structure. The correct IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is the conjugate base of propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. So, the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the deprotonated form of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is HOCH2COOCH3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

So, the carbon in the middle is the one attached to the COOCH3 group. So, substituents on that carbon are:

1. COOCH3,
2. CH2OH,
3. and two H's? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon is the second carbon, so the structure would be CH2(OH)-CO-OCH3. So, the carbon connected to the COOCH3 is CH2-OH. So, the substituents are:

- COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- and two H's.

So, that's three substituents plus two H's? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon is CH2OH connected to the COOCH3. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2OH group. So the central carbon is the one in the CH2OH. So, substituents are:

- COOCH3 (from the carbonyl),
- OH,
- CH2- (the other side of the CH2),
- and another H.

Wait, no, the CH2OH group is a single carbon attached to the COOCH3. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-COOCH3.

So the carbon in the middle (the CH2) is connected to:

1. The COOCH3 group,
2. The hydroxyl group,
3. Two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, OH, H, H. So, two H's, so it's not a chiral center. Thus, this compound doesn't have a chiral center and hence no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait! What if the molecule is something else? Am I making a mistake here?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility of an internal plane of symmetry. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. But in this case, the substituents are different: one side is the methyl ester, the other side is the hydroxyl and CH2. So, maybe there's no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's more like O=C(OCH3)-CH2-OH. So, the central carbon (the one attached to the COOCH3) is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- and two H's.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of this as a possibility. If the compound has a chiral center, it would show optical isomerism. So, in this case, the central carbon has three different groups: COOCH3, OH, and two H's. So, two H's are identical, so it's not a chiral center. So, this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the adjacent carbon is a chiral center? No, because in this structure, the adjacent carbon is CH2, which is attached to two H's. So, no. So, maybe compound 2 doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm.

Moving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a diketone, with two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. Its structure is (Ph)2CO. So, each benzene is attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon has two phenyl groups and two oxygen double bonds. Wait, no: the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is aryl. So, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. So, the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are two phenyl groups and an oxygen (double bond). But wait, the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized, so it can't be a chiral center because it only has three substituents (two phenyls and the double bond to O). So, no chiral centers here. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical—both substituents are phenyl groups—so it can't be chiral. So, benzophenone doesn't have optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CHCH-COOH, but in the fumarate form, the double bond is trans. So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but that's not right. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would be [CH2(COOCH3)]-CH=CH-[CH2(COOCH3)]? No, wait, wait. Let me get the structure correct. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH where the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents (the COOH groups) are on opposite sides (E configuration). So, the dimethyl ester would have COOCH3 groups on each end, connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but wait, no, that's four carbons. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH-(COOCH3)2. No, wait, more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH-C(COOCH3)2. No, perhaps it's O=C-OCH3 attached to a double bond. Let me think: the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH2COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, no, I think the correct structure is CH2CH=CH(COOCH3)2. No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's the dimethyl ester of (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, that's four carbons. No, wait, but butenedioic acid has four carbons with double bonds.

Wait, the correct structure for fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3.

No, that's five carbons. Wait, perhaps it's best to think in terms of the molecule's symmetry. Fumarate is the trans diastereomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, in the molecule, each COOCH3 is attached to a CH group, with a double bond between them.

Wait, regardless of the exact structure, what matters is whether the molecule has a chiral center or not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-butenedioate, which is a trans double bond. So, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. Now, considering whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't be chiral. For example, if the two ends are mirror images, then it's a meso compound.

Wait, but if the substituents on either end are the same, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: each end has a COOCH3 group attached to a CH group. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3), but that's not a double bond. Oh, wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate: the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end, connected via a double bond. So, the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, that's four carbons: two methyl esters, and a double bond in the middle. The structure would have each COOCH3 group on either end of the double bond. So, the molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)CH2? No, perhaps it's (E)-CH2=CH-(COOCH3)2. Wait, I'm not getting the structure correctly, but perhaps the key is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on either end, arranged trans.

Now, whether this molecule is chiral. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But in the case of fumarate, the substituents on either end are the same (COOCH3 and CH2 groups), but arranged trans. Wait, let me think: in fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, each attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers but may have geometric isomerism. Wait, but geometric isomerism is about different spatial arrangements around a double bond, which isn't directly causing optical isomerism. However, if the molecule has a center of asymmetry, like a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: whether the molecule contains a chiral center. For that, I need to see if any carbon has four different substituents.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3), but that's for the cis isomer. Wait, no, for fumarate, it's the trans isomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, no, that can't be because that would require more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Hmm, but I'm getting stuck on the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Dimethyl fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure should be CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but with a double bond in the middle. No, wait, but butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond. Wait, no, but that's for the cis isomer. Alternatively, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH in the trans configuration.

So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each end has a CH2 group attached to the COOCH3. Now, looking at the CH2 groups: the carbon in the middle is attached to what?

Wait, the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each of the CH2 groups is on either end of the double bond. So, the carbons attached to the COOCH3 groups are each CH2, which have two H's, and the COOCH3 and the double bond.

So, the carbons attached to COOCH3 have the structure CH2-COOCH3. So, each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the double bond.

Wait, but a double bond is between two carbons. So, the central double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with the central double bond, making it CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, but that would make four carbons: the two CH2 groups on either end, then a double bond between the two CH groups in the middle. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, which is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons: the two CH2 groups, a double bond, and another CH group. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, so each end is a CH2 group attached to a COOCH3. So, looking at the CH2 groups: each is attached to the COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each CH2 group is attached to:

1. COOCH3,
2. two H's,
3. and connected to the next carbon via a double bond.

Wait, but wait, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, perhaps the structure is more accurately:

COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH2-COOCH3. No, that can't be right. I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is connected via a double bond to another CH2 group with another O=C-OCH3.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. If each of the CH2 groups attached to the COOCH3 has the same substituents, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and hence achiral.

Wait, if the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on either end are the same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's a meso compound, meaning it's achiral despite having stereogenic centers. Wait, does it have any chiral centers?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but has a double bond with E configuration. So, the double bond's stereochemistry doesn't create a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, another possibility is that the molecule is a geometric isomer but not chiral. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this more carefully. Is dimethyl fumarate chiral? If it's a meso compound, it won't be chiral. So, in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center because one of the carbons attached to the COOCH3 groups has four different substituents. Let me think. Take the carbon attached to the COOCH3 group. If the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, then the CH2 group is attached to:

1. COOCH3,
2. two H's,
3. and a double bond.

Wait, no, the CH2 group would be attached to the double bond via a single bond, so it's CH2-CH=CH-... So, the substituents on the CH2 would be:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH group.

Wait, no, the CH2 is connected to the double bond. So, the substituents are:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the adjacent carbon (which is part of the double bond).

So, the substituents are COOCH3, H, H, and the adjacent carbon. Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of a double bond, so it's a CH group. So, the substituents on the CH2 are:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH group connected via a double bond.

But each of these substituents is different? No, because two are H's. So, that carbon can't be a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and hence doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not confident. I think I might be missing something here.

Now, let's go back to the options. The question is which of the four compounds show optical isomerism.

If I'm correct that compound 1 doesn't, compound 2 doesn't, compound 3 doesn't, and compound 4 doesn't... but that can't be right because the options don't include an option with none. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me re-examine it. Compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, so the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group.

Wait, that's four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH2 (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the CH2OH) is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, OH, H, H. So, two H's, so not a chiral center. But wait, the adjacent carbon is CH2, which is connected to the CH2OH and another CH2 group. So, that's not a chiral center either.

But wait, wait. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group.

Wait, no, that's (CH3)(COOCH3)(OH)(CH2). No, I'm getting confused again. Perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is the CH2 group. So, substituents are:

- COOCH3,
- OH,
- two H's.

Thus, it's not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Which of the four compounds have a possibility of having a chiral center?

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I think this is symmetrical, so no.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: No chiral center.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers, as the structure is symmetrical.

Wait, but that would mean none of them exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be right. So, perhaps I have made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be because that would imply a four-carbon chain. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on a CH group, which is connected via a double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
|
CH2

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each end has a CH2 group attached to a COOCH3, and the middle has a double bond.

In this case, each of the CH2 groups is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the adjacent CH group.

So, substituents are COOCH3, H, H, and CH. So, two H's, so not a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Since the substituents on either end are the same (COOCH3 and CH2 groups), the molecule might be symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, all four compounds don't exhibit optical isomerism. But that can't be the case because the options don't have that as an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does have a chiral center. Let me re-examine it. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected via a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and ester groups at 2 and 2' positions.

Looking at the carbons at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene ring. Each of these carbons is attached to the ester group (-COOCH3), the benzene ring, and two other substituents. Wait, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and one substituent. So, for the carbon at position 2, it's attached to the benzene, the ester group, and two other carbons in the ring. So, those carbons are part of the benzene ring and thus sp² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps there's another carbon elsewhere that could be a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center due to the arrangement of substituents around the biphenyl.

Wait, the biphenyl itself might have axial chirality. Axial chirality refers to the stereoisomerism arising from the restricted rotation around the bond connecting two aromatic rings. So, if the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged in a way that creates a lack of a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on the biphenyl, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So, the arrangement is such that each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester at position 2. So, the substituents are symmetrical on each ring.

Wait, but the biphenyl can have a certain configuration where the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. For example, if the substituents on each benzene are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. So, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

Ah, that's a possibility I hadn't considered. So, axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on each benzene ring are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents are in a configuration where the two rings are not mirror images, the molecule is chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring. So, if the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, it could lead to axial chirality.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents at 2 and 2' are both ester groups, and at 6 and 6' are nitro groups. So, the arrangement might be such that the substituents are symmetrically placed, leading to no axial chirality. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps it's safer to assume that compound 1 doesn't have axial chirality because the substituents are symmetrical. Or does it?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the entire molecule asymmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the possibility that compound 1 has axial chirality, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 1 and possibly another would show optical isomerism.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, looking at the options, which ones are correct.

If compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) has no optical isomerism, then options A and B are out, as they include 4. If compound 1 has axial chirality, then it would show optical isomerism, and if any others do, then the answer would be A, B, etc.

But I'm not sure about compound 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound 2 has a chiral center. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- OH,
- two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, OH, H, H. So, not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait: perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the OH and the COOCH3) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another H.

So, substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So, four different groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So, the molecule would have optical isomerism.

Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Because then the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that would make it a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, what about compound 1? If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates axial chirality, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. But if the substituents are symmetrically placed, it won't.

In compound 1, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on each benzene ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So, the substituents are on opposite sides of each benzene ring. Would that create a plane of symmetry? Or would it lead to axial chirality?

I think it would create axial chirality because the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical. Wait, no. Because the substituents on each ring are the same kind (ester at 2 and nitro at 6), so the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical. For example, if the ester groups are on the same side on each ring, but the nitro groups are on opposite sides. That could create a chiral arrangement.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given that the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the intended answer is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, earlier I concluded that compound 2 has a chiral center, so it exhibits optical isomerism. What about compound 4?

Earlier, I thought compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have a chiral center. But perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Its structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons. So, the structure is more accurately:

COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's six carbons. I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each end has a CH2 group attached to COOCH3, and the double bond is in the middle.

In this case, each CH2 group is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the adjacent CH group.

So, substituents are COOCH3, H, H, and CH. So, not a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the two ends are mirror images, then the molecule is achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

- Compound 1: No optical isomerism (due to symmetry).
- Compound 2: Yes (chiral center).
- Compound 3: No.
- Compound 4: No.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. Option A includes 4, which I don't think is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is a chiral center. If that's the case, then the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, the central carbon is the one connecting the two benzene rings. So, what substituents does it have?

It would be connected to two benzene rings, and perhaps two other groups. Wait, but in biphenyl, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other groups. Oh wait, no, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So, the central atom is a carbon connected to two benzene rings. So, each benzene ring is attached to this carbon. So, the substituents on this carbon are two benzene rings, and two methyl groups? No, in this case, the substituents would be the two benzene rings and perhaps two other groups, but in this compound, it's [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. So, the central carbon is the one at position 1 on each benzene. So, each benzene is connected to this central carbon. So, the substituents on this carbon are two benzene rings, and two other groups. Wait, but in this compound, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So, the central carbon is part of each benzene ring, meaning it's sp² hybridized and can't be a chiral center.

So, no, compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

If only compound 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each end has a CH2 group attached to COOCH3. So, the substituents on each CH2 are:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the adjacent CH.

Wait, but that's three substituents. So, not a chiral center. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another compound that exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Its structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each end has a CH2 group connected to COOCH3. Are there any chiral centers in this structure? Each CH2 group is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the adjacent CH group.

So, substituents are COOCH3, H, H, CH. So, two H's, so no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, the ester groups at 2 and 2' positions. Each of those carbons is attached to the benzene ring, the ester group, and two other substituents. So, perhaps those carbons are chiral centers.

Wait, each of those carbons is part of the benzene ring, so sp² hybridized, so can't be chiral centers.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits axial chirality (restricted rotation around a bond, leading to stereoisomerism).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and ester groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The central carbon connecting the two benzene rings is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The substituents on the molecule are symmetrically arranged, making it achiral. Therefore, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH₃. The carbon atom at the 2-position (attached to the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (CH₃), an ester group (COOCH₃), a hydroxyl group (OH), and another carbon (CH). This makes it a chiral center. Thus, this compound **exhibits optical isomerism**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone is a symmetrical molecule with two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. The carbon in the ketone group is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-isomer of butenedioate, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is symmetrical, with identical substituents on either side of the double bond. It lacks a chiral center and has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds have chiral centers or exhibit axial chirality. However, based on the provided options, the closest match is **Option D (1 and 2)**, assuming compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism under certain interpretations of axial chirality.
