Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I need to find the velocity of particle A. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various velocities.

Wait, annihilation processes usually involve particles and their antiparticles converting into other particles. But in this case, the products are two particles and their antiparticles, so maybe some energy and momentum conservation is involved.

The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, right, when something is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics? But wait, the particles produced have a mass of 300 MeV/c². Hmm, relativistic effects might still matter because the products are at high energy.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial kinetic energy is low, so the total energy in the system might be dominated by the rest mass energies, but I'm not so sure.

Let me think. The process is p + p̄ annihilating into two A⁺ and two A⁻. So perhaps the initial total energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton's energies. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps both are moving, but the antiproton is slow.

Wait, actually, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity. Hmm.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So their rest masses are both about 938 MeV/c² each. The mass of A is 300 MeV/c², so each A is lighter than the proton.

In the annihilation, two A⁺ and two A⁻ are produced. So the total number of particles increases, but that's okay.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, and the antiproton is moving, the initial momentum isn't zero.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps it's moving with some small velocity, but maybe I can approximate some things. Alternatively, maybe the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is approximately 2 * m_p c², but I'm not sure.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So the total energy is approximately the sum of their rest energies. But wait, the proton could be at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity.

Alternatively, if the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial system's total energy is approximately (m_p c² + m_p c²) + kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, the kinetic energy might be small compared to rest energy.

But what about the final state? The two A⁺ and two A⁻. Let's model this as a four-body system. But maybe it's symmetric; perhaps the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta balance out.

Wait, let's think in the center of momentum frame. But since the antiproton is moving, maybe it's easier to think in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Let me try that. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Since it's moving slowly, v is much smaller than c, but I'm not sure if that helps.

In the lab frame (proton at rest), the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c², where gamma is for the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²). So maybe I can approximate gamma as 1 + something small.

Wait, but the antiproton's velocity is small, so its kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p v². Hmm, but I don't know v yet. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe in the center of mass frame, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the products (A⁺ and A⁻) are all moving in a symmetric way.

Wait, considering that the products are 2A⁺ and 2A⁻, perhaps they are emitted symmetrically, each A⁺ and A⁻ moving in opposite directions, leading to zero net momentum? But wait, the initial system has some momentum because the antiproton is moving. So the total initial momentum isn't zero; therefore, the products must carry some net momentum.

Wait, maybe each pair of A's is moving in some symmetric fashion. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can apply conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote the momentum of the antiproton as p_initial, and the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. So the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v, where gamma is approx 1 plus (v²)/(2c²), because v is small.

In the final state, the total momentum must equal this initial momentum. So the sum of the momenta of the four particles (2A⁺ and 2A⁻) must equal p_initial.

But this might be complicated because each particle could have a different momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are all moving in the same direction as the original antiproton, but that might not be the case. Maybe the system emits particles in a symmetric fashion.

Wait, but without knowing the exact directions, this could be tricky. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy and momentum can be considered in terms of invariant quantities. The invariant mass squared s is equal to (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (sum E_i c)^2 - (sum p_i c)^2. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

But wait, the initial particles are p and p̄, so their total energy is E_p + E_p̄, and their total momentum is zero (if they are moving in opposite directions with same speed), but wait, in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

Wait, perhaps the initial total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c², and the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

In the final state, the total energy is sum of energies of the four A particles, and the total momentum is sum of their momenta.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can make some approximations because the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, given that the antiproton is slow, maybe the initial momentum is small compared to their energies. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², because the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. Then the products must have a total energy of about 2 m_p c².

But if the products have a higher mass, perhaps each A's energy is higher than their rest mass.

Wait, m_A c² is 300 MeV, so each A has rest energy 300 MeV. The initial total rest energy is 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. So the total energy available is higher than the rest mass of the products, so relativistic effects will matter.

Wait, but the initial energy includes the kinetic energy of the antiproton, which is small. So perhaps the total energy is roughly 2 * 938 MeV plus a small amount.

Wait, but the products are four particles each with 300 MeV rest energy, so total rest energy is 4*300=1200 MeV. But the initial rest energy is 1876 MeV. So the initial energy is higher, so the products can have higher kinetic energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this helps in finding the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the annihilation as a process where the initial particles' energy is converted into the kinetic and rest energy of the products.

Wait, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the lab frame, proton is at rest, so momentum of proton is zero. Antiproton is moving with velocity v.

So initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v = (m_p v)/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but since v is small, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²).

Wait, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe v is small, so gamma is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

In the final state, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Let's assume that all A particles move in the same direction as the initial antiproton. This might not be the case, but perhaps it's a simplifying assumption.

Wait, but if all four A particles are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add up, but that might not balance the initial momentum unless each has a certain velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in pairs, such that each pair has some momentum in opposite directions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ from a pair are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. But if there are two such pairs, then each pair contributes some net momentum.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should instead consider that each A particle has the same velocity, so they're all moving in the same direction, and their momenta add up.

So, if each A has velocity u, and since there are four of them, their total momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u, where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for each A.

So, setting this equal to p_initial, which is approximately m_p v, since v is small.

Hmm, but wait, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v. But if v is small, gamma is about 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v.

But perhaps I can write the equation as 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.

In terms of energy, the total energy of the four A particles is 4 gamma_A m_A c². The initial total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

So, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Hmm, but if v is small, then (v²)/(2c²) is even smaller, so gamma is approx 1 plus a tiny term.

Wait, but perhaps I can write gamma = 1 + (v²)/(2c²), and then express u in terms of gamma and other variables.

So, let's write the two equations:

1. 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.
2. 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

Hmm, but this seems a bit circular. Let me try to express u in terms of gamma_A and v.

Wait, maybe I can solve for gamma_A from the energy equation.

From equation 2:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma)

Divide both sides by m_A c²:

4 gamma_A = (m_p / m_A) (1 + gamma)

gamma_A = [ (m_p / (4 m_A) ) (1 + gamma) ) ]

But m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So m_p / (4 m_A) = (938) / (4 * 300) ≈ 938 / 1200 ≈ 0.7817.

So gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma)

But gamma is approximately 1 plus (v²)/(2c²). Hmm. Since v is small, let's say v << c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²) ≈ 1.

So, gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + 1) = 0.7817 * 2 ≈ 1.5634.

Wait, but if gamma_A is 1.5634, then the Lorentz factor is about 1.56, which would correspond to a velocity of roughly sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma_A²)) ) * c.

Wait, let me compute that. gamma_A is about 1.5634.

So, gamma squared is (1.5634)^2 ≈ 2.445.

So, 1/(gamma_A²) ≈ 0.4089.

Thus, sqrt(1 - 0.4089) = sqrt(0.5911) ≈ 0.7688.

So, velocity u ≈ 0.7688 c.

But looking at the options, option D is 0.86c, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but this is under the assumption that v is negligible and that gamma is approximately 1. But maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should make a more precise calculation. Let me try to write the equations again.

From equation 2:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma)

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma)

So, gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ] / (4 m_A )

Substituting m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c².

gamma_A = (938 * (1 + gamma)) / (4 * 300 ) = (938/(1200)) (1 + gamma)

938 / 1200 ≈ 0.7817, so gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma)

From equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v

Divide both sides by 4 m_A:

gamma_A u = (gamma m_p v) / (4 m_A )

But m_p / m_A = 938 / 300 ≈ 3.1267.

So,

gamma_A u = (gamma * 3.1267 v ) /4 ≈ (gamma * 3.1267 v ) /4

Hmm, but I need to relate u and v. Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of u and gamma.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can make an approximation. Let's assume that the initial velocity v is such that the antiproton's kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So, (gamma - 1) m_p c² << m_p c². So gamma is approx 1 + (v²)/(2c²), and since v is small, perhaps (v²)/(2c²) is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²).

Wait, but if the initial energy is m_p c² + gamma m_p c², and the final energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c², then:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma )

Substituting gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²):

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (2 + (v²)/(2 c²)) )

But m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So,

4 gamma_A * 300 = 938 (2 + (v²)/(2c²))

Hmm, 4 * 300 = 1200, so:

gamma_A = [938 (2 + (v²)/(2c²)) ] / 1200

But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I should consider the momentum equation.

From equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v

Substituting m_p = 938, m_A = 300,

4 gamma_A * 300 * u = gamma * 938 * v

So,

gamma_A u = (gamma * 938 * v) / (4 * 300 )

gamma_A u = (gamma * 938 v ) / 1200

gamma_A u ≈ (gamma * 0.7817 v )

Hmm, but I'm not sure where this is going.

Wait, perhaps I can express u in terms of v.

u = [ (gamma * 0.7817 v ) ] / gamma_A

But from earlier, gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

u = [ gamma * 0.7817 v ] / [ 0.7817 (1 + gamma) ) ]

Simplify,

u = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

Hmm, that's better. So,

u = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c, so gamma is approximately 1. Let's make that substitution.

So,

u ≈ [1 * v ] / (1 + 1 ) = v / 2

So u ≈ v/2.

But that's an approximation. So, if the initial velocity v is small, the velocity of the A particles is about half that.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I should instead consider that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is small compared to the rest energy, so the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c².

So, 4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c^2.

So,

gamma_A = (2 m_p c² ) / (4 m_A c² ) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A ) )

m_p / (2 m_A ) = 938 / (2 * 300 ) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A is about 1.5633.

Then, to find u, the velocity of the A particles:

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c² )

So,

1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c² )

Take reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - u²/c² ) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.64.

Square both sides,

1 - u²/c² ≈ 0.4096.

So,

u²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

u ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.7685 c.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.86c. Hmm, but that's higher than 0.7685c. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the initial conditions.

Wait, wait a second. If the initial kinetic energy is negligible, then the total energy is about 2 m_p c². But if the A particles are moving with gamma_A = 1.5633, their total energy would be 4 * 1.5633 * 300 MeV = 4 * 469 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV, which equals the initial 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. So that matches.

So, the energy part checks out, but the momentum might not balance. Because in this case, the initial momentum is m_p v, and the final momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A u.

If the initial momentum is much smaller than the rest energy terms, perhaps this approximation holds. But if the initial momentum is non-negligible, this might not be the case.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is small. So, initial momentum is m_p v. Let's say v is 0.1c, then p_initial is 0.1 * 938 MeV/c ≈ 93.8 MeV/c.

The final momentum would be 4 * gamma_A m_A u = 4 * 1.5633 * 300 MeV/c * u / c.

Wait, but u is 0.7685 c, so u/c is 0.7685.

So, 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.7685 ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.7685.

Wait, 4 * 1.5633 ≈6.2532, 6.2532 * 300 = 1875.96, 1875.96 * 0.7685 ≈ 1442 MeV/c.

So, initial momentum is 93.8 MeV/c, but the final momentum is about 1442 MeV/c. That's a big discrepancy. So, my assumption that the initial momentum is negligible (so that I could ignore it) isn't valid. Hmm, so the approximation that the initial momentum is small is not correct, which means I can't ignore it.

So, my earlier approach is flawed because I neglected the momentum, but the momentum is actually significant compared to the rest energy. So, I need to consider both energy and momentum conservation properly.

Let me try to set up the equations properly.

Let me denote:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c²,

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v,

Final energy: E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c²,

Final momentum: p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A u,

Assuming all A particles move in the same direction with same velocity u (since the problem is symmetric, perhaps this is a valid assumption).

Wait, but I'm not sure if they all move in the same direction. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of A particles (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving in opposite directions, which would cause their momenta to cancel. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial.

Hmm, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that all four A particles move with the same velocity u in the same direction, so their momenta add up.

So, p_final =4 gamma_A m_A u.

But the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

Thus, 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v. Equation (1).

The energy equation is:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma m_p ) c².

Because E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma )

So,

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma )     Equation (2).

Now, from equation (2), gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ] / (4 m_A )

Substituting m_p = 938, m_A = 300,

gamma_A = (938 (1 + gamma )) / (4 * 300 ) = (938 / 1200 ) (1 + gamma ) ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

From equation (1), 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.

Substitute gamma_A:

4 * [0.7817 (1 + gamma ) ] * 300 * u = gamma * 938 * v.

Simplify,

4 * 0.7817 * 300 ≈ 4 * 0.7817 * 300 = 4 * 234.51 ≈ 938.04.

So left side is 938.04 (1 + gamma ) u.

Right side is gamma * 938 v.

Divide both sides by 938,

(1 + gamma ) u = gamma v.

So,

u = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

Hmm, but I also have Equation (2): gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Wait, but from equation (2), gamma_A is expressed in terms of gamma. So, perhaps I can find another relation.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), but since v is small, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c² )

Wait, maybe I can write gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c² )

Then,

gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + 1 + (v²)/(2 c² )) ) ≈ 0.7817 (2 + (v²)/(2 c² )) )

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between u and v from equation (1): u = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

But since gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c² ), maybe I can approximate u as:

u ≈ [ (1 + (v²)/(2c² )) v ] / (2 + (v²)/(2c² )) )

But for small v, this would approximate to u ≈ v / 2.

But earlier I saw that when I assumed that, momentum didn't match up, so perhaps I need to find a more accurate relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that gamma is approximately 1, as an initial approximation, then find u, and then iterate.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter approach. Let me think about the problem again.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻.

Let me consider the center of mass frame. Wait, because in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, which might make the equations simpler.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the initial system's momentum is small, but in the center of mass frame, the momentum is zero.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in the center of mass frame.

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. So the total momentum is p = gamma m_p v.

The total energy is E = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The invariant mass squared s is (E)^2 - (p c)^2.

s = (m_p c² + gamma m_p c² )^2 - (gamma m_p v c )^2

= m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c².

Factor out m_p^2 c^4:

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - ( gamma^2 v^2 )/(c^2 ) ]

But v is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c² ), so let me substitute that.

gamma = 1 + (v²)/(2 c² )

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 2 + (v²)/(2 c² )

(1 + gamma )^2 = [2 + (v²)/(2 c² ) ]^2 = 4 + 2*(v²)/(c² ) + (v^4)/(4 c^4 )

And,

gamma^2 v^2 / c^2 = [ (1 + (v²)/(2 c^2 ))^2 ] v^2 / c^2 = [1 + v²/(c^2 ) + (v^4)/(4 c^4 ) ] (v^2/c^2 )

But since v is small, higher order terms (v^4) can be neglected.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 / c^2 ≈ [1 + v²/(c^2 ) ] (v^2/c^2 ) ≈ v^2 / c^2 + (v^4)/(c^4 )

But again, higher order terms can be neglected, so gamma^2 v^2/c^2 ≈ v^2 / c².

Putting it all together,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (4 + 2 v²/c² ) - (v²/c² ) ]

= m_p^2 c^4 [4 + v²/c² ]

So,

s = 4 m_p^2 c^4 + m_p^2 c^2 v^2.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so m_p^2 c^2 v^2 is much smaller than 4 m_p^2 c^4.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the total energy is sqrt(s), which is the same as the invariant mass.

In the center of mass frame, the products (2A⁺ and 2A⁻) have energy E_cm = sqrt(s), and their total momentum is zero.

So, their total energy is E_cm = sqrt(4 m_p^2 c^4 + m_p^2 c^2 v^2 )

But since v is small, this is approximately 2 m_p c² + (m_p c^2 v^2)/(4 m_p c^2 )

Wait, perhaps using a binomial expansion.

sqrt(4 m_p^2 c^4 + m_p^2 c^2 v^2 ) = sqrt(4 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + (v^2)/(4 c^2 )) ) )

= 2 m_p c² sqrt(1 + (v^2)/(4 c^2 )) )

≈ 2 m_p c² (1 + (v^2)/(8 c^2 ) )

But since v is small, the correction term is small.

But I'm not sure how this helps me find the velocity of the A particles.

In the center of mass frame, the four A particles are moving with some velocities, but their total momentum is zero. So perhaps each A pair is moving in opposite directions.

But perhaps each A has the same velocity magnitude but opposite direction.

Wait, but if all four A particles are moving in pairs, with two going in one direction and two in the opposite, their momenta would cancel. So the total momentum is zero.

Hmm, but perhaps each A has the same velocity magnitude but opposite direction.

Wait, but for four particles, maybe two go in direction +x and two in -x, each with velocity u. So each has momentum gamma m_A u in their respective directions. So the total momentum would be 2 gamma m_A u - 2 gamma m_A u = 0. That works.

So, in the center of mass frame, each A has velocity u, but some are in +x and others in -x.

But then, how does that help me find u?

Well, in the center of mass frame, the total energy is sqrt(s) = sum of the energies of the A particles.

Each A has energy gamma m_A c^2, so four of them have 4 gamma m_A c^2 = sqrt(s) ≈ 2 m_p c^2 (1 + (v^2)/(8 c^2 )) )

Wait, so,

4 gamma m_A = 2 m_p (1 + (v^2)/(8 c^2 ) )

So,

gamma = [ 2 m_p (1 + v^2/(8 c^2 )) ]/(4 m_A )

= (m_p/(2 m_A )) (1 + v^2/(8 c^2 )) )

But m_p/(2 m_A ) = 938/(600) ≈ 1.5633.

So,

gamma ≈ 1.5633 (1 + v^2/(8 c^2 )) )

Hmm, but this seems to be getting into a loop.

Wait, perhaps I can relate u to the velocity in the lab frame. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the center of mass frame, the A particles have some velocity, and then use the velocity transformation to find their velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The center of mass is moving with velocity V relative to the lab frame.

To find V, I can use the relation between the lab frame and the center of mass frame.

The velocity of the center of mass (V) is given by:

V = (p_initial c ) / E_initial

p_initial = gamma m_p v,

E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2 = m_p c^2 (1 + gamma )

So,

V = (gamma m_p v c ) / [ m_p c^2 (1 + gamma ) ] ) = (gamma v ) / [ c (1 + gamma ) ]

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

V = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) * v ] / [ c (1 + 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can approximate for small v.

Since v is small, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c² )

So,

V ≈ [ (1 + (v²)/(2 c² )) v ] / [ c ( 2 + (v^2)/(2 c^2 )) ) ]

But for small v, higher order terms may be negligible.

So,

V ≈ [ (1 * v ) ] / [ c * 2 ] = v/(2 c )

So, the center of mass is moving at V ≈ v/(2 c ) in the lab frame.

In the center of mass frame, the A particles are moving with velocity u', and in the lab frame, their velocity u is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + V ) / (1 + (u' V )/c² )

But if in the center of mass frame, the A particles are moving with velocity u', then in the lab frame, their velocity is higher by V.

But perhaps each A is moving in opposite directions, so some have u = u' + V, others have u = -u' + V. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Alternative approach: consider that the initial system's four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial c ), and the final four-momentum is (E_final, p_final c ). So, they must be equal.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c²,

p_initial c = gamma m_p v c.

The final four-momentum is four times the four-momentum of each A, assuming all have same velocity u.

So,

E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c²,

p_final c =4 gamma_A m_A u c.

So,

E_initial =4 gamma_A m_A c²,

p_initial c =4 gamma_A m_A u c.

Dividing the second equation by the first,

(p_initial c ) / E_initial = (4 gamma_A m_A u c ) / (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) )

Simplify,

(p_initial c ) / E_initial = u / c

So,

u = c (p_initial c ) / E_initial )

But,

p_initial c = gamma m_p v c,

E_initial = m_p c² (1 + gamma )

So,

u = c * [ gamma m_p v c ] / [ m_p c² (1 + gamma ) ] )

Simplify,

u = ( gamma v ) / ( c (1 + gamma ) )

Hmm, this seems familiar. So,

u = ( gamma v )/( c (1 + gamma ) )

Now, I can write this as u = [ gamma/(1 + gamma ) ] * (v/c )

But gamma = (1 - v²/c² )^(-1/2 )

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) = [ (1 - v²/c² )^(-1/2 ) ] / [ 1 + (1 - v²/c² )^(-1/2 ) ]

This seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can simplify it.

Let me denote beta = v / c, so beta is small because v is small.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² )

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) = [1/sqrt(1 - beta² ) ] / [ 1 + 1/sqrt(1 - beta² ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - beta² ):

= [1 ] / [ sqrt(1 - beta² ) + 1 ]

Hmm, for small beta, sqrt(1-beta² ) ≈ 1 - beta²/2.

So,

sqrt(1 - beta² ) + 1 ≈ 2 - beta²/2.

But wait, beta is small, so beta² is very small. So,

sqrt(1 - beta² ) + 1 ≈ 2.

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) ≈ [1 ] / 2.

So,

u ≈ (1/2 ) beta c = v/(2 )

But wait, that's the same as before. So, u ≈ v/2.

Hmm, but earlier I saw that the momentum equation didn't hold. So, perhaps I should find another relation.

Wait, but maybe I can find v in terms of u.

Wait, from the equation u = [ gamma v ]/( c (1 + gamma ) )

Multiply both sides by c (1 + gamma ):

u c (1 + gamma ) = gamma v

But v = beta c, so,

u c (1 + gamma ) = gamma beta c

Divide both sides by c,

u (1 + gamma ) = gamma beta

But,

beta = v/c.

So,

u (1 + gamma ) = gamma (v/c )

But v is small, so beta is small. Hmm.

Wait, but from the momentum equation, I have:

u = [ gamma v ]/(c (1 + gamma ) )

So,

u = [ gamma beta c ]/(c (1 + gamma )) )

= [ gamma beta ]/(1 + gamma )

= [ beta ]/( sqrt(1 - beta² ) (1 + 1/sqrt(1 - beta² )) )

Hmm, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta.

Let me set beta = v/c, so small.

Then,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² ) ≈ 1 + (beta² )/(2 )

So,

gamma ≈ 1 + (beta² )/2.

Now, from the equation:

u = (gamma beta ) / (1 + gamma )

Substituting gamma,

u ≈ [ (1 + (beta²)/2 ) beta ] / (2 + (beta²)/2 )

But beta is small, so beta² <<1.

So,

numerator ≈ beta,

denominator ≈ 2.

So,

u ≈ beta / 2.

But then, u = (v)/(2 c ) * c = v/2.

But earlier, when I assumed u = v/2, the momentum equation didn't balance. So, perhaps this suggests that the initial approximation is not valid, and I need to include higher-order terms.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with u = (gamma beta )/(1 + gamma )

But,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² )

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) = 1/(sqrt(1 - beta² ) + 1 )

Let me consider the denominator sqrt(1 - beta² ) + 1.

Let me denote x = beta^2, which is small.

sqrt(1 - x ) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - ...

So,

sqrt(1 - x ) + 1 ≈ 2 - x/2.

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) ≈ 1/(2 - x/2 )

≈ (1/2 ) [ 1 + (x/2 )/(4) ) ] [using 1/(a - b ) ≈ 1/a (1 + b/a ) for small b]

Wait, no.

Wait, 1/(2 - x/2 ) = (1/2 ) * 1/(1 - x/(4) )

≈ (1/2 ) [1 + x/(4) + (x^2)/(16) + ... ]

But x is beta^2, so small.

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) ≈ (1/2 ) [ 1 + x/4 ]

= 1/2 + x/(8 )

So,

gamma/(1 + gamma ) ≈ 1/2 + (beta^2 )/(8 )

So,

u = [ gamma beta ]/(1 + gamma ) ≈ [ (1 + beta^2/2 ) beta ] / (2 + beta^2/2 )

But since beta is small, let's expand.

Denominator: 2 + beta^2/2 ≈ 2 (1 + beta^2/(4) )

So,

u ≈ [ (1 + beta^2/2 ) beta ] / [ 2 (1 + beta^2/(4) ) ]

≈ [ beta (1 + beta^2/2 ) ] / [ 2 (1 + beta^2/(4) ) ]

Using approximation 1/(1 + a ) ≈ 1 - a for small a,

≈ [ beta (1 + beta^2/2 ) ] * (1 - beta^2/(4) ) / 2

Multiply out,

= [ beta ( (1)(1) + (1)(-beta^2/4) + (beta^2/2)(1) + (beta^2/2)(-beta^2/4) ) ] / 2

But higher order terms (beta^4) are negligible,

= [ beta (1 - beta^2/4 + beta^2/2 ) ] / 2

Simplify,

= [ beta (1 + beta^2/4 ) ] / 2

≈ [ beta + (beta^3)/4 ] / 2

≈ beta/2 + (beta^3)/8

So,

u ≈ (beta/2 ) ( 1 + (beta^2)/2 )

But beta is small, so u ≈ beta/2.

This brings us back to the same approximation, but perhaps I can use this to relate u and v.

Wait, if u ≈ v/2, but that leads to a discrepancy in the momentum, perhaps I should consider higher-order terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial approximation is insufficient because the momentum is not negligible compared to the initial energy.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The final momentum is p_final =4 gamma_A m_A u.

The energy equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma m_p ) c².

From this,

gamma_A = (m_p (1 + gamma )) / (4 m_A )

But m_p/(4 m_A ) = 938/(4 *300 ) ≈ 0.7817.

So,

gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Now, from u = [ gamma v ]/( c (1 + gamma ) )

But, using the velocity addition formula,

u = (gamma beta c )/(1 + gamma )

So,

u = beta c (gamma )/(1 + gamma )

But, from the expression above,

gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Now, we have u expressed in terms of beta,

u = beta c (gamma )/(1 + gamma )

But let's express gamma in terms of gamma_A.

gamma = (gamma_A )/(0.7817 )

So,

gamma = gamma_A / 0.7817.

Substituting into u,

u = beta c * (gamma_A / 0.7817 ) / (1 + gamma_A / 0.7817 )

= beta c * gamma_A / [ 0.7817 (1 + gamma_A / 0.7817 ) ]

= beta c * gamma_A / [ 0.7817 + gamma_A ]

Hmm, but this seems to complicate things further.

Perhaps I can make an iterative approximation. Let's assume that gamma_A is about 1.5633, as before.

Then,

gamma = gamma_A / 0.7817 = 1.5633 / 0.7817 ≈ 2.

So, gamma ≈ 2.

Then, beta is v/c, and since gamma = 2,

gamma = 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - beta^2 ) = 1/2

1 - beta^2 = 1/4

beta^2 = 3/4

beta = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, so v = beta c ≈ 0.866 c.

But this contradicts the initial assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Wait, but if gamma is about 2, then the antiproton's speed is about 0.866 c, which is high, not slow. So this suggests that my initial assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly might not hold when considering the momentum balance.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate my approach. Maybe I should use the exact equations without approximation.

So, exact equations:

1. 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma m_p v.

2. 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma )

We can write equation 2 as gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ] / (4 m_A )

Substituting into equation 1,

4 * [ m_p (1 + gamma )/(4 m_A ) ] m_A u = gamma m_p v

Simplify,

m_p (1 + gamma ) u = gamma m_p v.

Cancel m_p,

(1 + gamma ) u = gamma v.

So,

u = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

Now, express gamma in terms of u.

But,

gamma = (1 + gamma ) u / v.

Wait, but this seems to not help.

Alternatively, let me express v in terms of u and gamma.

v = (1 + gamma ) u / gamma.

But from equation 2,

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ] / (4 m_A )

But gamma_A is also given by gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2 ) = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ] / (4 m_A )

But,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2 ) = [ m_p (1 + 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )) ] / (4 m_A )

But since v is expressed in terms of u and gamma, perhaps this is getting too tangled.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute v from equation u = [ gamma v ]/(1 + gamma )

So,

v = [ (1 + gamma ) u ] / gamma.

We can write v = u (1 + gamma ) / gamma.

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - [ u^2 (1 + gamma )^2 / (gamma^2 c^2 ) ] )

Hmm, this seems too complicated.

Alternative approach: Let me make an assumption for u, compute gamma_A, then compute gamma, then compute v, and see if the values make sense.

Let me try option B: 0.96c.

Compute gamma_A for u=0.96c.

gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

= 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216 )

= 1/sqrt(0.0784 )

≈ 1/0.28 = approx 3.571.

From equation 2,

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ]/(4 m_A )

= (938 MeV/c² * (1 + gamma )) / (4 * 300 MeV/c² )

= (938/(1200)) (1 + gamma )

≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Setting gamma_A = 3.571,

3.571 = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

1 + gamma = 3.571 / 0.7817 ≈ 4.57.

gamma ≈ 3.57.

So, gamma ≈ 3.57.

Compute v from gamma = 3.57.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma² ) ≈ 1/(12.74 )

≈ 0.07846.

v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.07846 = 0.9215.

v ≈ sqrt(0.9215 ) c ≈ 0.96 c.

Hmm, that's the same as option B. So, this suggests that the velocity u is 0.96c, which matches option B.

Wait, but according to the earlier equations, when u is 0.96c, then v would be 0.96c.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v should be much less than c. But this leads v ≈ 0.96c, which is a high velocity.

This suggests that the initial assumption of the antiproton moving slowly is not valid with this approach, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption was incorrect, and the antiproton is actually moving at a high velocity, which would explain the high u.

But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach by considering the conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame.

In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.

So, the initial four-momentum is (E_initial, 0 ), where E_initial = sqrt(s ), and s is the invariant mass squared.

The final four-momentum is (4 gamma_A m_A c², 0 ), since all A's are moving symmetrically.

So,

E_initial =4 gamma_A m_A c².

But E_initial is also equal to sqrt( (m_p c² + gamma m_p c² )^2 - (gamma m_p v c )^2 )

Hmm, but perhaps this is the same as earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation:

In the center of mass frame,

E_cm = sqrt(s ) = 4 gamma_A m_A c²,

p_cm =0.

But I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the annihilation as a process where all the rest mass energy is converted into kinetic energy for the products, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, given that the problem gives m_A c² =300 MeV, and the proton and antiproton have rest mass 938 MeV each.

So, the rest energy of the initial system is 2 *938 = 1876 MeV.

The rest energy of the final system (4 *300 )= 1200 MeV.

So, the initial rest energy is higher than the final, meaning that the annihilation process would release energy, which goes into the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, but in this case, since the initial system is moving (antiproton is moving), the products could have higher energy.

Hmm, but perhaps I can use the energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame.

In lab frame:

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c²,

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

Final:

E_final =4 gamma_A m_A c²,

p_final =4 gamma_A m_A u.

So,

Equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma )

Equation 2:4 gamma_A m_A u c = gamma m_p v c.

Divide equation 2 by equation 1,

[4 gamma_A m_A u c ] / [4 gamma_A m_A c² ] = [gamma m_p v c ] / [ m_p c² (1 + gamma ) ]

Simplify,

u / c = [ gamma v ] / [ c (1 + gamma ) ]

So,

u = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

From equation 1,

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ] / (4 m_A )

= (938 MeV/c² * (1 + gamma )) / (4 * 300 MeV/c² )

= (938/1200 ) (1 + gamma )

= 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Now, the velocity u is given in the options, so perhaps I can substitute each option into equation u = [gamma v ]/(1 + gamma ), and see which one satisfies.

But I also need to relate gamma and v.

Wait, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma.

v = beta c, where beta = v/c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Now, substituting into u,

u = [ gamma * beta c ] / (1 + gamma )

= [ gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 ) c ] / (1 + gamma )

= [ gamma * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1 )/gamma^2 ) c ] / (1 + gamma )

= [ gamma * sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma ) c ] / (1 + gamma )

= [ sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) c ] / (1 + gamma )

= [ sqrt( (gamma -1)(gamma +1) ) c ] / (gamma +1 )

= [ sqrt( gamma -1 ) * sqrt(gamma +1 ) c ] / (gamma +1 )

= sqrt( gamma -1 ) * c / sqrt(gamma +1 )

= c * sqrt( (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) )

Hmm, so,

u = c * sqrt( (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) )

But from equation gamma_A =0.7817 (1 + gamma ), and gamma_A is 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c² )

Wait, substituting u into gamma_A,

gamma_A =1/sqrt(1 - [ c^2 ( (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) ) ) ] )

Wait, no. Wait, u² = c² (gamma -1)/(gamma +1 )

So,

1 - u^2/c^2 = 1 - (gamma-1)/(gamma+1) = [ (gamma+1) - (gamma-1) ]/(gamma+1 ) ) = [2 ]/(gamma+1 )

So,

gamma_A =1 / sqrt( [2 ]/(gamma +1 ) ) ) = sqrt( (gamma +1 ) / 2 )

So,

gamma_A = sqrt( (gamma +1 ) / 2 )

But from equation gamma_A =0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

sqrt( (gamma +1) /2 ) =0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Let me square both sides,

( (gamma +1 ) / 2 ) = (0.7817 )^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

So,

(gamma +1 ) / 2 = (0.611 ) (1 + gamma )^2.

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma ), assuming it's non-zero,

1/2 = (0.611 ) (1 + gamma )

So,

1 + gamma = 1/(2 * 0.611 ) ≈ 1/(1.222 ) ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.818 -1 = -0.182.

Hmm, but gamma is always ≥1, so this can't be right. So, this suggests a mistake in my calculations.

Ah, I see. I think I made a mistake in substituting u into gamma_A.

Wait, I found that u = c sqrt( (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) )

So,

gamma_A =1/sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2 )

=1/sqrt( 1 - (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) )

=1/sqrt( [ (gamma +1 ) - (gamma -1 ) ] / (gamma +1 ) )

=1/sqrt( [2 ]/(gamma +1 ) )

gamma_A = sqrt( (gamma +1 ) /2 )

So, this part is correct.

Then,

gamma_A = sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 )

From equation gamma_A =0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Thus,

sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 ) =0.7817 (gamma +1 )

Square both sides,

(gamma +1 )/2 = (0.7817 )^2 (gamma +1 )^2

= 0.611 (gamma +1 )^2

Divide both sides by (gamma +1 ), assuming it's non-zero,

1/2 = 0.611 (gamma +1 )

So,

gamma +1 = 1/(2 * 0.611 ) ≈ 0.818.

Thus,

gamma ≈ 0.818 -1 = -0.182.

Which is impossible because gamma is always ≥1.

This suggests that our assumption leads to a contradiction, which means that perhaps our approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should make a substitution that gamma_A is expressed as sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 ), and also as 0.7817 (gamma +1 )

So,

sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 ) =0.7817 (gamma +1 )

Let me let x = gamma +1. Then,

sqrt( x / 2 ) = 0.7817 x.

Square both sides,

x/2 = (0.7817 )^2 x².

= 0.611 x².

Divide both sides by x (x !=0 ),

1/2 = 0.611 x.

So,

x = 1/(2 * 0.611 ) ≈ 0.818.

So,

x = gamma +1 = 0.818 → gamma = -0.182.

Again, impossible. So, this suggests that no solution exists with these equations, which is impossible.

Wait, but this can't be right because the problem states that such a process exists. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution of u into the equation. Let me go back.

We have:

u = c * sqrt( (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) )

Which comes from the earlier steps.

gamma_A =1/sqrt(1 - u²/c^2 )

=1/sqrt( 1 - (gamma -1)/(gamma +1) )

=1/sqrt( [ (gamma +1) - (gamma -1) ]/(gamma +1) )

=1/sqrt( [ 2 ]/(gamma +1 ) )

= sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 )

So, that's correct.

So,

gamma_A = sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 )

But from equation gamma_A =0.7817 (gamma +1 )

So,

sqrt( (gamma +1 )/2 ) =0.7817 (gamma +1 )

Let me write x = gamma +1, so,

sqrt( x/2 ) =0.7817 x.

Square both sides,

x/2 = (0.7817 )^2 x² = 0.611 x².

So,

x/2 = 0.611 x².

Divide both sides by x,

1/2 = 0.611 x → x= 1/(2 *0.611 ) ≈0.818.

But x=gamma+1≈0.818 → gamma≈-0.182, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's no solution under these assumptions, which can't be right. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel, leading to zero net momentum. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Maybe they are moving in pairs, leading to zero net momentum.

Wait, if two A⁺ are moving in the +x direction and two A⁻ in the -x direction, their momenta would cancel. So the total momentum would be zero.

But that would require the initial momentum of the antiproton to be zero, which contradicts the problem statement. So this can't be the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation that in any frame, the sum of the energies and momenta must be the same.

But perhaps I can consider the situation where the A particles are produced at rest, but that would require the initial system to have zero momentum, which isn't the case. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps I should try plugging in the answer choices and see which one satisfies the equations.

Let's take option B: u=0.96c.

Compute gamma_A for u=0.96c.

gamma_A =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96² )= 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28= approx 3.571.

From equation gamma_A=0.7817 (gamma +1 )

So,

3.571 =0.7817 (gamma +1 )

gamma +1 =3.571 /0.7817≈4.57 → gamma≈3.57.

So, gamma≈3.57.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -v²/c² ) → sqrt(1 -v²/c² )=1/3.57≈0.28.

So,

1 -v²/c² ≈0.0784 → v²/c²≈0.9216 → v≈0.96c.

So, v≈0.96c.

But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v should be much less than c. So this doesn't make sense.

So, this suggests that option B isn't the correct answer under the problem's conditions.

Hmm, perhaps option C: u=0.91c.

Compute gamma_A.

gamma_A=1/sqrt(1 -0.91² )=1/sqrt(1 -0.8281 )=1/sqrt(0.1719 )≈1/0.4146≈2.41.

From equation gamma_A=0.7817 (gamma +1 )

So,

2.41=0.7817 (gamma +1 )

gamma +1=2.41/0.7817≈3.08 → gamma≈2.08.

Gamma=2.08→v= sqrt(1 -1/(2.08)^2 ) c.

1/(2.08)^2≈1/4.326≈0.231.

So,

v= sqrt(1 -0.231 )=sqrt(0.769 )≈0.877c.

So, v≈0.877c. Still much higher than what's considered slow.

So this can't be the correct answer either.

Hmm, perhaps option D: u=0.86c.

gamma_A=1/sqrt(1 -0.86² )=1/sqrt(1-0.7396 )=1/sqrt(0.2604 )≈1/0.510≈1.96.

So, gamma_A=1.96.

From equation gamma_A=0.7817(gamma +1 )

1.96=0.7817 (gamma +1 )

gamma +1=1.96/0.7817≈2.505 → gamma≈1.505.

gamma=1.505 → beta= sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2 ))=sqrt(1 - (1/(1.505)^2 ))≈sqrt(1 -0.442 )=sqrt(0.558 )≈0.747c.

So, v≈0.747c.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which I think implies v <<c. So, 0.747c is not slow. So option D also doesn't fit.

Option A: u=0.77c.

gamma_A=1/sqrt(1 -0.77² )=1/sqrt(1-0.5929 )=1/sqrt(0.4071 )≈1/0.638≈1.568.

So gamma_A=1.568.

From equation gamma_A=0.7817 (gamma +1 )

1.568=0.7817 (gamma +1 )

gamma +1=1.568/0.7817≈2.005 → gamma≈1.005.

gamma=1.005 → beta= sqrt(1 -1/(1.005)^2 )≈sqrt(1 -0.9900 )=sqrt(0.01 )=0.1.

So, v≈0.1c.

Ah, this fits the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, v≈0.1c is a small velocity, as stated.

So, in this case, u=0.77c, v=0.1c, which matches the problem's condition.

So, the correct answer is option A: 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) under the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly. The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after the annihilation must be conserved:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   where \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2 \) (proton at rest and antiproton moving with velocity \( v \)), and \( E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \) (four \( A \)-particles with energy \( \gamma_A m_A c^2 \)).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The total momentum before and after the annihilation must be conserved:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}
   \]
   where \( p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p v \) (momentum of the moving antiproton), and \( p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A u \) (total momentum of the four \( A \)-particles, assuming they all move in the same direction).

3. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) and \( u \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma_A \) for the \( A \)-particles is related to their velocity \( u \) by:
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}
   \]

4. **Expressing \( \gamma_A \) in Terms of \( \gamma \)**:  
   From energy conservation:
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{m_p (1 + \gamma)}{4 m_A}
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.

5. **Relating \( u \) and \( v \)**:  
   From momentum conservation:
   \[
   u = \frac{\gamma v}{1 + \gamma}
   \]

### Analysis of the Options
We test each option for \( u \) by calculating \( \gamma_A \), \( \gamma \), and \( v \), ensuring consistency with the problem's condition that the antiproton is moving slowly (\( v \ll c \)).

#### Option A: \( u = 0.77c \)
1. Calculate \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.77)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.5929}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.4071}} \approx 1.568
   \]

2. Use \( \gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \):  
   \[
   1.568 = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \implies 1 + \gamma = \frac{1.568}{0.7817} \approx 2.005 \implies \gamma \approx 1.005
   \]

3. Calculate \( v \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1.005 \implies \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.005)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.9900} = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1 \implies v \approx 0.1c
   \]

This satisfies the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly (\( v \ll c \)).

#### Option B: \( u = 0.96c \)
1. Calculate \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} \approx 3.571
   \]

2. Use \( \gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \):  
   \[
   3.571 = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \implies 1 + \gamma = \frac{3.571}{0.7817} \approx 4.57 \implies \gamma \approx 3.57
   \]

3. Calculate \( v \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 3.57 \implies \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(3.57)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.07846} = \sqrt{0.9215} \approx 0.96 \implies v \approx 0.96c
   \]

This does not satisfy the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly.

#### Option C: \( u = 0.91c \)
1. Calculate \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.91)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.8281}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.1719}} \approx 2.41
   \]

2. Use \( \gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \):  
   \[
   2.41 = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \implies 1 + \gamma = \frac{2.41}{0.7817} \approx 3.08 \implies \gamma \approx 2.08
   \]

3. Calculate \( v \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 2.08 \implies \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(2.08)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.231} = \sqrt{0.769} \approx 0.877 \implies v \approx 0.877c
   \]

This does not satisfy the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly.

#### Option D: \( u = 0.86c \)
1. Calculate \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.86)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.7396}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.2604}} \approx 1.96
   \]

2. Use \( \gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \):  
   \[
   1.96 = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma) \implies 1 + \gamma = \frac{1.96}{0.7817} \approx 2.505 \implies \gamma \approx 1.505
   \]

3. Calculate \( v \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1.505 \implies \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.505)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.442} = \sqrt{0.558} \approx 0.747 \implies v \approx 0.747c
   \]

This does not satisfy the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition that the antiproton is moving slowly (\( v \ll c \)) is **Option A: \( u = 0.77c \)**.
