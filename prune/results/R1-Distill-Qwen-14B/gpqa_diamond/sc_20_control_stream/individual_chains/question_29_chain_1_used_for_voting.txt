Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some mutation. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding which mutation would eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they looked at the first exon where changes were found.

The intact gene's sequence is given, and there are four mutants. I need to figure out which mutation would likely disrupt the production of the anti-nutritional compound. I remember that if a gene is nonfunctional, it usually can't produce the protein, so the compound might not be made.

Looking at the sequences, all the changes are in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein. But how?

Each mutation changes certain bases. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing:
Original first part: TTTCTCGC
Mutant 1: TTCTACGC
So the change is at positions 4-7 perhaps. Let me count the letters. Wait, ATG is the start. Next three: TTT in the intact, but in Mutant 1, it's TTCT. So, wait, let's break it down.

Wait, the first part: Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
So the 4th nucleotide is T in intact, then in Mutant 1, it's T as well? Maybe I should write it out.

Wait another approach: looking for changes that cause a frameshift or a stop codon, or a missense that disrupts the protein.

Wait, but all these mutations are point mutations? Because EMS typically causes point mutations, usually transitions. So only single base changes, not deletions or insertions.

So, each mutation changes a few bases. Let me see each mutant's changes.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GGT GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GGT GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA
Wait, looking at the first exon area. Let me align the sequences.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGT ACT ... Hmm, perhaps the first part is a bit different. Let me find where the changes occur.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for nonsense mutations (stop codons) or significant amino acid changes.

Wait, the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. That compound is made by the gene product. So, if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made. So a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would be desired.

Looking for a mutation that causes a premature stop codon, which would truncate the protein and possibly make it nonfunctional.

So let's check each mutant.

Intact gene (partial sequence):

...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1:

...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Comparing, the original has TTTCTCGC at positions 4-10 or so. In Mutant 1, it's TTCTACGC.

Wait, let's count the nucleotides.

Original: positions 4-10 (maybe) are TTTCTC G.

Mutant 1: TTCTAC G.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the amino acids.

The original starts with ATG as the start codon (methionine). Then TTT is Phe. Then CTC is Leu. Then GCT is Ala.

Mutant 1: ATG followed by TTCT. So first codon is still methionine (ATG), second codon is TTCT. Wait, the second codon is TTT in original (Phe), in Mutant 1 it's TTCT. Wait no, the original is ATG TTT CTC GCT... So after ATG, the next codons:

1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGT...
Wait, perhaps the exact changes are in the nucleotides. Let's see:

Original first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1's first part:
ATG TTCTACGCTGGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps the first few codons are:

Original:
ATG (1-3)
TTT (4-6)
CTC (7-9)
GCT (10-12)
GGT (13-15)
ACT (16-18)
TCT (19-21)
GTG (22-24)
GAT (25-27)
GAA (28-30)
...

Mutant 1:
ATG (1-3)
TTCTACGCT... Wait, maybe that's 3 nucleotides at a time.

Wait, perhaps I should write the original and mutant 1 sequences in triplets.

Original:
1-3: ATG (Met)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
28-30: GAA (Glu)
...

Mutant 1's sequence:
Looking at the first part: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
So in triplets:

1-3: ATG (same)
4-6: T T C (TTC is Phe, same as original? Wait, original 4-6 is TTT (Phe), mutant 1 4-6 is TTC (Phe as well? Because TTC is also Phe. Wait, so first codon same, second codon same, third codon different.

Original 7-9: CTC (Leu)
Mutant 1 7-9: TAC (Tyr). Oh, wait, because in the original, after ATG and TTT, the next is CTC. But in mutant 1, that would be TAC.

Wait wait, let me structure it correctly.

Original:

Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
...

Mutant 1: the sequence is ATG followed by TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, after ATG, the next 3 are TTC (positions 4-6?), but wait:

Wait, the entire mutant 1 sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So, breaking into triplets:

1-3: ATG (same)
4-6: T T C (TTCT is possibly the next three? Wait, the sequence after ATG is TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, maybe I should write it as triplets, each starting at position 1,4,7, etc.

Original:

Positions 1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

22-24: GTG

25-27: GAT

28-30: GAA

...

Mutant 1:

Positions:

1-3: ATG

4-6: T T C (since the next 3 after ATG are TTC)

Wait, the mutant sequence is ATG followed by TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, positions 4-6: T T C (TTC is Phe, same as original in positions 4-6 (which is TTT). So that's a T to C change at position 6.

Then positions 7-9: TAC (TAC is Tyr). Original had CTC (Leu). So in mutant 1, positions 7-9 are TAC.

So, the amino acids would be:

Original: Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu ...

Mutant 1: Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu ...

Wait, so the third codon changed from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). That's a missense mutation. So, the protein would have a Tyr instead of Leu at that position.

But that might not necessarily disrupt the entire function. Unless it's in a critical region.

Looking at the other mutants.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTC (Phe)

7-9: TAA (Stop codon!) Because TAA is a stop codon (amber stop). Oh, so in this mutant, at position 7-9, it's TAA, which would cause a premature stop.

So, in mutant 2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated early. That might cause the gene to be nonfunctional, so the compound isn't made.

Wait, so that's a good candidate for eliminating the compound.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (same as original, Phe)

7-9: TAC (same as mutant 1, Tyr)

10-12: GCT (same as original, Ala)

13-15: GGT (same, Gly)

16-18: GTC (Val instead of ACT (Thr))

Wait, original 16-18: ACT (Thr)

Mutant 3 16-18: GTA C ... Wait, let's see:

Mutant 3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: TAC (Tyr)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: GGT (Gly)

16-18: G T C (GTC is Val)

Original at 16-18: ACT (Thr)

So, position 16-18 in mutant 3 is GTC (Val), whereas original is ACT (Thr). So that's a change from Thr to Val.

Then, 19-21: ACT (original was TCT (Ser)), but mutant 3 has TCA (Ser as well, since TCA is Ser). So from TCT to TCA, same amino acid.

22-24: TGT (Cys) in mutant 3, original was GTG (Val). So Cys instead of Val.

So, this introduces changes in the protein, but not a stop codon. So the protein would be altered but might still be functional if the changes are not critical.

Mutant 4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: TAC (Tyr)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: ACT (Thr) original had GGT (Gly) here. Wait, no, original's 13-15 is GGT (Gly). Wait, mutant 4's sequence: after GCT comes A C T.

Wait, let's parse it.

Mutant 4's sequence: ATG TTTT ACG CTA CTT CTG TGG ATG...

Wait, perhaps the positions are:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: TAC

10-12: GCT

13-15: ACT

16-18: CTT (Ser)

19-21: CTG (Leu)

22-24: TGG (Trp)

Wait, original at 13-15 is GGT (Gly), but here it's ACT, which is Thr. So, that's a big change. Then 16-18 is CTT (Ser), but original had TCT (Ser). So same amino acid. Then 19-21: CTG (Leu), original was GTG (Val). So, Leu instead of Val.

But wait, let me look for a stop codon. Are any of the triplets in mutant 4 a stop?

Original after 13: GGT (Gly)

Mutant 4's 13-15: ACT (Thr)

Then 16-18: CTT (Ser)

19-21: CTG (Leu)

22-24: TGG (Trp)

Original 22-24 was GTG (Val). So, no stop codon in mutant 4.

So, the only mutant that introduces a stop codon is Mutant 2, where at positions 7-9, there's TAA.

TAA is a stop codon, so the mRNA would be translated up to that point and then stop. The protein would be truncated, possibly making it nonfunctional.

If the gene product is nonfunctional, the anti-nutritional compound won't be synthesized, which is what we want.

So, looking at the options, option A is Mutant 2, which has a stop codon. So that's the one that would eliminate the compound.

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, significantly altering the protein or rendering it nonfunctional. Let us analyze each mutant:

### Intact Gene Sequence (partial):
```
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’
```
- **Amino acid sequence**: Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu His Tyr Cys Gly …

### Mutant 1:
```
5’-ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 7-9: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr).  
  - Codon 13-15: GCT (Ala) → GCT (Ala).  
  - Codon 22-24: GTG (Val) → GTG (Val).  
- **Effect**: A missense mutation changes Leu to Tyr at position 7-9. This alters the protein but does not introduce a stop codon. The protein may remain partially functional.

### Mutant 2:
```
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 7-9: CTC (Leu) → TAA (Stop).  
- **Effect**: A premature stop codon (TAA) is introduced at position 7-9. This truncates the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional. As a result, the anti-nutritional compound will not be synthesized.

### Mutant 3:
```
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 4-6: TTT (Phe) → TTT (Phe).  
  - Codon 7-9: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr).  
  - Codon 16-18: ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val).  
  - Codon 22-24: GTG (Val) → TGT (Cys).  
- **Effect**: Several missense mutations occur, altering the protein. However, no stop codon is introduced, so the protein may still be functional.

### Mutant 4:
```
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 13-15: GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr).  
  - Codon 19-21: GTG (Val) → CTG (Leu).  
- **Effect**: Missense mutations alter the protein, but no stop codon is introduced. The protein may still be functional.

### Conclusion:
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) is **Mutant 2**. This truncates the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional and preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the best candidate for eliminating the compound.

So in triplets:

1-3: ATG (same)
4-6: T T C (TTC is Phe, same as original? Wait, original 4-6 is TTT (Phe), mutant 1 4-6 is TTC (Phe as well? Because TTC is also Phe. Wait, so first codon same, second codon same, third codon different.

Original 7-9: CTC (Leu)
Mutant 1 7-9: TAC (Tyr). Oh, wait, because in the original, after ATG and TTT, the next is CTC. But in mutant 1, that would be TAC.

So, after ATG, the next 3 are TTC (positions 4-6?), but wait:

Wait, the entire mutant 1 sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So, breaking into triplets:

Mutant 1:

Positions:

Wait, the mutant sequence is ATG followed by TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, positions 4-6: T T C (TTC is Phe, same as original in positions 4-6 (which is TTT). So that's a T to C change at position 6.

Then positions 7-9: TAC (TAC is Tyr). Original had CTC (Leu). So in mutant 1, positions 7-9 are TAC.

So, the amino acids would be:

Original: Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu ...

Mutant 1: Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu ...

Wait, so the third codon changed from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). That's a missense mutation. So, the protein would have a Tyr instead of Leu at that position.

But that might not necessarily disrupt the entire function. Unless it's in a critical region.

Looking at the other mutants.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTC (Phe)

7-9: TAA (Stop codon!) Because TAA is a stop codon (amber stop). Oh, so in this mutant, at position 7-9, it's TAA, which would cause a premature stop.

So, in mutant 2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated early. That might cause the gene to be nonfunctional, so the compound isn't made.

Wait, so that's a good candidate for eliminating the compound.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (same as original, Phe)

7-9: TAC (same as mutant 1, Tyr)

10-12: GCT (same as original, Ala)

13-15: GGT (same, Gly)

16-18: GTC (Val instead of ACT (Thr))

Wait, original 16-18: ACT (Thr)

Mutant 3 16-18: GTA C ... Wait, let's see:

Mutant 3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: TAC (Tyr)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: GGT (Gly)

16-18: G T C (GTC is Val)

Original at 16-18: ACT (Thr)

So, position 16-18 in mutant 3 is GTC (Val), whereas original is ACT (Thr). So that's a change from Thr to Val.

Then, 19-21: ACT (original was TCT (Ser)), but mutant 3 has TCA (Ser as well, since TCA is Ser). So from TCT to TCA, same amino acid.

22-24: TGT (Cys) in mutant 3, original was GTG (Val). So Cys instead of Val.

So, this introduces changes in the protein, but not a stop codon. So the protein would be altered but might still be functional if the changes are not critical.

Mutant 4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Triplets:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: TAC (Tyr)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: ACT (Thr) original had GGT (Gly) here. Wait, no, original's 13-15 is GGT (Gly). Wait, mutant 4's sequence: after GCT comes A C T.

Wait, let's parse it.

Mutant 4's sequence: ATG TTTT ACG CTA CTT CTG TGG ATG...

Wait, perhaps the positions are:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: TAC

10-12: GCT

13-15: ACT

16-18: CTT (Ser)

19-21: CTG (Leu)

22-24: TGG (Trp)

Wait, original at 13-15 is GGT (Gly), but here it's ACT, which is Thr. So, that's a big change. Then 16-18 is CTT (Ser), but original had TCT (Ser). So same amino acid. Then 19-21: CTG (Leu), original was GTG (Val). So, Leu instead of Val.

But wait, let me look for a stop codon. Are any of the triplets in mutant 4 a stop?

Original after 13: GGT (Gly)

Mutant 4's 13-15: ACT (Thr)

Then 16-18: CTT (Ser)

19-21: CTG (Leu)

22-24: TGG (Trp)

Original 22-24 was GTG (Val). So, no stop codon in mutant 4.

So, the only mutant that introduces a stop codon is Mutant 2, where at positions 7-9, there's TAA.

TAA is a stop codon, so the mRNA would be translated up to that point and then stop. The protein would be truncated, possibly making it nonfunctional.

If the gene product is nonfunctional, the anti-nutritional compound won't be synthesized, which is what we want.

So, looking at the options, option A is Mutant 2, which has a stop codon. So that's the one that would eliminate the compound.

```
5’-ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 7-9: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr).  
  - Codon 13-15: GCT (Ala) → GCT (Ala).  
  - Codon 22-24: GTG (Val) → GTG (Val).  
- **Effect**: A missense mutation changes Leu to Tyr at position 7-9. This alters the protein but does not introduce a stop codon. The protein may remain partially functional.

### Mutant 2:
```
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 7-9: CTC (Leu) → TAA (Stop).  
- **Effect**: A premature stop codon (TAA) is introduced at position 7-9. This truncates the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional. As a result, the anti-nutritional compound will not be synthesized.

### Mutant 3:
```
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 4-6: TTT (Phe) → TTT (Phe).  
  - Codon 7-9: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr).  
  - Codon 16-18: ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val).  
  - Codon 22-24: GTG (Val) → TGT (Cys).  
- **Effect**: Several missense mutations occur, altering the protein. However, no stop codon is introduced, so the protein may still be functional.

### Mutant 4:
```
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
- **Changes**:  
  - Codon 13-15: GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr).  
  - Codon 19-21: GTG (Val) → CTG (Leu).  
- **Effect**: Missense mutations alter the protein, but no stop codon is introduced. The protein may still be functional.

### Conclusion:
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) is **Mutant 2**. This truncates the protein, likely rendering it nonfunctional and preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the best candidate for eliminating the compound.
