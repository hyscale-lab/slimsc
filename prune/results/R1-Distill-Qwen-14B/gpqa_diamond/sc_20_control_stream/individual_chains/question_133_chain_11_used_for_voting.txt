Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these phosphate calculations. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to think it through as best as I can.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄³⁻?) in the solution. Wait, no, wait. Orthophosphate is H₃PO₄. So the ion would be PO₄³⁻, right? Or is it HPO₄²⁻? Hmm. Wait, I remember that in the phosphate buffer system, the ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH.

Given the Kₐ values for H₃PO₄: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4⁻ + H+ (Ka1), the second is H2PO4⁻ ↔ HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3).

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, I think. But when dissolved in water, it dissociates. So the solution contains both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- ions, perhaps? Because we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, but wait, let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. So when it's dissolved in solution, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4⁻. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4⁻ from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4. So the phosphate species in solution are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-.

But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? So the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, no. H3PO4 is the acid, and PO4^3- is the conjugate base. So orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it can lose protons to become H2PO4⁻, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, but when we're in a solution with both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, the solution is probably a buffer solution. Because these are adjacent species in the dissociation steps.

So the solution is a buffer consisting of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- ions. Since these are the two species, their concentrations can be determined using the amounts of the two salts provided.

So the first step is to calculate the number of moles of each salt. Then, since the volume is the same, the concentrations will be moles divided by volume (0.2 L).

Let's compute the moles.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ let's see, 136.09 is approximately 136.1. So 1/136.1 is about 0.007336 mol. Wait, 136.1 * 0.007336 is 1. So 1g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007336 mol. But let me calculate it precisely.

1 / 136.09 = let's compute: 1 ÷ 136.09.

Well, 136 * 0.00735 is about 1 (136 * 7.35e-3 = 1.0002). So approximately 0.00735 mol.

But to be precise, let me do it:

136.09 × 0.00733 = 136 * 0.00733 = approx 1.0004. So yes, about 0.00733 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O, the mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ let's compute.

177.99 is about 178. So 1/178 ≈ 0.005618 moles.

Wait, 177.99 × 0.005618 ≈ 1. So yes, about 0.005618 mol.

So now, in the solution:

We have 0.00733 moles of H2PO4⁻ (from KH2PO4) and 0.005618 moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O).

Wait, but wait. Wait, when you dissolve Na2HPO4·2H2O, does it contribute to HPO4^2-?

Yes. Because Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. It dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the total moles of H2PO4⁻ is 0.00733 mol, and HPO4^2- is 0.005618 mol.

The total volume is 0.2 L, so their concentrations are:

[H2PO4⁻] = 0.00733 / 0.2 = 0.03665 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M

Wait, but the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, so the [H3PO4] in solution. But how can we find that?

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what's being asked. Because in the buffer system, the solution contains H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in solution, H3PO4 can't exist in significant amounts because it dissociates. So maybe the 'orthophosphate' here refers to HPO4^2-? Or H2PO4⁻? Or perhaps the question is about the sum of all phosphate species, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's re-read the question. It says, "the concentration of orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-? Wait, no. I think orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in this solution, H3PO4 would be a weak acid and would dissociate, so its concentration would be very low. Maybe that's why the answer is so small.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to the HPO4^2- as orthophosphate ions. Because sometimes, people refer to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. Hmm. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the conjugate base. But in the solution, we have H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution is made from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-.

So the primary species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-. The PO4^3- concentration would be negligible because it's the third dissociation and has a very small Ka (1.8e-12), so that's negligible. Similarly, the undissociated H3PO4 would be minimal because it's a weak acid, so it would dissociate, but the first Ka is 7.5e-3, so some of it would dissociate.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to H3PO4. But how can we find that?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it refers to the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4⁻. But according to the options, the answers are in the 1e-7 M range, which is very small, so I think it's more likely that it's referring to PO4^3-.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solution is made of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-. So PO4^3- would be negligible. So perhaps the question is about the concentration of H3PO4, which is the orthophosphate.

But how would that be possible? Since H3PO4 is a weak acid, it would dissociate into H+ and H2PO4⁻. So the concentration of H3PO4 would be very low.

Wait, but the solution has both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-. So perhaps the solution is buffered, and the pH is such that H3PO4 is not present in significant amounts. So the concentration of H3PO4 would be negligible. So maybe the question is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4⁻, but that doesn't make sense given the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo, and they're asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. But with such a low Ka3, that would be extremely small.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to calculate the concentration of the phosphate ions in their various forms, but the orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the undissociated form. But how to find that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis of the phosphate species to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, given that the solution is a buffer of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-, and the pH can be found, which then allows us to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation.

So perhaps that's the approach. Let me try that.

So, first, find the pH of the solution. The buffer consists of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

In this case, the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8, because H2PO4⁻ dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+ (Ka2).

So, the pH can be found using the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4⁻].

Earlier, we calculated [H2PO4⁻] as approximately 0.03665 M and [HPO4^2-] as 0.02809 M.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4⁻] is 0.02809 / 0.03665 ≈ 0.7669.

Then, pH = pKa2 + log(0.7669)

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.7669)

What's log(0.7669)? Well, 0.7669 is about 0.77, and log(0.77) is approximately -0.113.

So, pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.113 ≈ 7.094.

Now, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation step.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is the dissociation of HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

But since the pH is about 7.09, which is much higher than the pKa3 (pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74), wait no, wait pH is 7.09, which is lower than the pKa3. Wait, no, wait: pKa3 is 11.74, so pH 7.09 is much lower than that. So, in this case, the solution is on the acidic side of the third dissociation.

But wait, that would mean that the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. Because when pH < pKa, the conjugate base form (PO4^3-) is less favored.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, and [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094).

Let me compute [H+]: 10^(-7.094) is approximately 8.3e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.3e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14

Divide by denominator 8.3e-8:

5.056e-14 / 8.3e-8 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Hmm. So that's close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 1.8e-12 multiplied by 0.02809 is indeed approximately 5.056e-14.

Then, 5.056e-14 divided by 8.3e-8 is (5.056 / 8.3) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.609 * 1e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.09e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [H+] or the ratio.

Wait, let's re-calculate the pH more accurately.

The initial ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4⁻] was 0.02809 / 0.03665 ≈ 0.7669.

Taking log(0.7669), let me compute that more precisely.

Using a calculator (since I can't actually calculate it here, but I'll estimate):

Log(0.7669) = log(7.669e-1) = log(7.669) + log(1e-1) ≈ 0.885 + (-1) = -0.115.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

So [H+] is 1e-7.092 = approx 8.27e-8 M.

Wait, let's compute 10^(-7.092):

10^(-7) is 1e-7 = 0.0000001.

Now, 10^(-0.092) is about 0.827, because 10^(-0.1) is ~0.794, and 0.092 is a bit less than 0.1, so approx 0.827.

So [H+] is 8.27e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.27e-8)

Calculating numerator: 1.8 * 0.02809 = 0.05056 → 0.05056e-12 = 5.056e-14.

Denominator: 8.27e-8.

So 5.056e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (5.056 /8.27) * 1e-6.

Dividing 5.056 by 8.27: 5.056 ÷ 8.27 ≈ 0.611.

So 0.611e-6 = 6.11e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.1e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me check the initial moles again.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 = approx 0.007335 moles.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol → 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.0056189 moles.

So [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056189 / 0.2 = 0.0280945 M.

So the ratio is 0.0280945 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.7669.

So log(0.7669) = ?

Using log(0.7669) = log(7.669 * 1e-1) = log(7.669) + log(0.1) → log(7.669) is about 0.885, so 0.885 -1 = -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

So [H+] = 1e-7.092 = 8.27e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0280945) / (8.27e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0280945 = 5.057e-14.

Denominator: 8.27e-8.

So 5.057e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (5.057 / 8.27) * 1e-6.

5.057 ÷ 8.27 → Let's compute: 8.27 * 0.611 = 5.057 (because 8 *0.6=4.8, 0.27*0.6=0.162 → 4.962. 8*0.01=0.08, 0.27*0.01=0.0027 → 0.0827. 0.611 *8.27 → 5.057). So 0.611.

So 0.611e-6 = 6.11e-7 M.

So the concentration is approximately 6.11e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is the closest.

But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation. Because sometimes the buffer equation can be about the two species, but perhaps I should consider the exact ratio.

Wait, maybe a more precise calculation of the ratio.

Ratio = 0.0280945 / 0.036675 = let's compute:

0.0280945 ÷ 0.036675.

Let me compute 28094.5 / 36675.

Hmm, 28094.5 ÷ 36675 → approx 0.7669.

So, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^−, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is H3PO4. So perhaps I should compute the concentration of H3PO4.

Wait, how?

H3PO4 is a weak acid with Ka1 =7.5e-3. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^−.

The concentration of H3PO4 can be found using the Ka1 expression.

The initial concentration of H3PO4 would be x, and the concentrations of H+ and H2PO4^- would come from the dissociation.

But wait, in this solution, we have significant amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the solution's phosphate species are mainly H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But H3PO4 is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and H+. So perhaps the concentration of H3PO4 can be found considering the buffer solution.

Wait, but in reality, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the second dissociation. So the first dissociation (H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-) is less important because H2PO4^- is already in solution, and perhaps the reverse process (H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-) is more relevant.

So, perhaps the concentration of H3PO4 is minimal and given by the first dissociation.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. But that doesn't make sense because HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the term "orthophosphate." Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.

So, in that case, the question is about finding the concentration of PO4^3-.

Which we calculated as approximately 6.11e-7 M, which aligns with option A (6.24e-7). But the options don't have 6.11e-7, but A is 6.24e-7.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio more accurately.

Let me recompute the ratio.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0280945 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.

Ratio = 0.0280945 / 0.036675 = let's compute this with more precision.

0.0280945 ÷ 0.036675.

Well, 0.0280945 = 28094.5e-6.

0.036675 = 36675e-6.

So 28094.5 / 36675 = let me compute this division.

36675 × 0.766 is 36675 *0.7 =25672.5; 36675 *0.06=2200.5; 36675 *0.006=220.05 → total 25672.5 +2200.5=27873 +220.05=28093.05. So 0.766 times 36675 is 28093.05. So 28094.5 is very close to that, so the ratio is approximately 0.766.

So ln(0.766) is about -0.267, but wait, we need log(0.766) which is -0.115 as before.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

So [H+] = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.27e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.0280945) / (8.27e-8) = (5.056e-14) / 8.27e-8 = 6.11e-7.

Which is ~6.11e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me calculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056189 moles / 0.2 L = 0.0280945 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 moles / 0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

Ratio = 0.0280945 / 0.036675 = let me compute 28094.5 / 36675.

Compute 36675 * 0.766 = 28093.05. So 28094.5 is 1.45 more than that. So 1.45 / 36675 ≈ 3.95e-5.

So ratio is approximately 0.766 + 3.95e-5 ≈ 0.7660395.

So log(0.7660395) = ?

Using a calculator approach: Let me compute log(0.766).

We know that log(7.66) = 0.885.

Wait, wait, no: 10^0.885 ≈ 7.66.

So log(0.766) = log(7.66e-1) = 0.885 -1 = -0.115.

So same as before.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.11e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7. But wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.0280945 M.

[H+] =8.27e-8.

So:

1.8e-12 × 0.0280945 = 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.27e-8 → 5.056e-14 /8.27e-8 = (5.056/8.27) * 1e-6.

5.056 /8.27 = 0.611.

So 0.611e-6 = 6.11e-7 M.

Hmm, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 2% higher. Maybe due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.092, so [H+]=10^-7.092.

Compute 10^-7.092.

We can write this as 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.092).

Compute 10^(-0.092):

Using the Taylor series approximation for small x, 10^x = 1 + x*ln(10) + (x^2 * (ln(10))^2)/2 + ... but x is -0.092.

Alternatively, knowing that 10^0.092 ≈1.24 (since log(1.24)=0.0936). So 10^-0.092≈1/1.24≈0.8064.

So [H+] =1e-7 * 0.8064= 8.064e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0280945) / (8.064e-8).

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.0280945=5.056e-14.

Denominator:8.064e-8.

So 5.056e-14 /8.064e-8 = (5.056 /8.064) * 1e-6.

5.056 ÷8.064 ≈0.627.

So 0.627e-6=6.27e-7 M.

Which is closer to 6.27e-7, which is very close to option A:6.24e-7.

So that's probably the correct answer, option A.

Wait, but let me compute 5.056e-14 /8.064e-8.

= (5.056 /8.064) * 1e-6.

5.056 /8.064 = let's compute.

8.064 × 0.625 =5.04, which is just a bit less than 5.056. So 5.056 /8.064 is approximately 0.627.

So 0.627e-6 =6.27e-7, which is approximately 6.27e-7 M.

So, our calculation gives 6.27e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

So, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). The relevant equilibrium for PO₄³⁻ is governed by the third dissociation of phosphate:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄:
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005619 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L. Thus:
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007335}{0.200} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M}\),
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005619}{0.200} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Determine pH of the buffer
The buffer consists of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the equilibrium governed by \(K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right),
\]
where:
- \(\text{p}K_a2 = \log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\),
- \(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} = \frac{0.02809}{0.03668} \approx 0.7669\),
- \(\log(0.7669) \approx -0.115\).

Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
Using the third dissociation equilibrium:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}.
\]
- \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.27 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\),
- Substituting values:
  \[
  [PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.27 \times 10^{-8}}.
  \]
- Numerator: \(1.8 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.02809 \approx 5.056 \times 10^{-14}\),
- Denominator: \(8.27 \times 10^{-8}\),
- \([PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.27 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.11 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.11 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which is closest to option **A (6.24 \times 10^{-7} M)**.
