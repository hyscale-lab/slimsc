Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the answers. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about isomers and some compounds. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers, and they're divided into constitutional and stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers have different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like with double bonds or chiral centers.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in different isomers. Like in ketones and aldehydes with alpha hydrogens, they can undergo tautomerism, such as keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone... wait, benzoquinone is a quinone. Quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So for example, para-benzoquinone has two ketones opposite each other.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Let me visualize it. Each of the carbons 1,3,5 has a ketone. So it's a symmetrical structure.

Tautomerism would require the presence of alpha hydrogens, right? Because the keto-enol tautomerism involves moving a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, creating an enol form.

In benzoquinone, each ketone is on the benzene ring. The benzene ring is conjugated, but wait, the carbonyl groups are at the positions. So each carbonyl is attached to two carbons. Do they have alpha hydrogens? Let me think: The carbonyl in benzoquinone is C=O. The adjacent carbons (on the benzene) are attached to other carbons. Wait, no, the quinone structure is like O=C6H4-C=O. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are each part of the benzene ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl. Wait, no, the benzene ring carbons are each connected to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen. Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen. So in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but in reality, each ketone is at the 1 and 4 positions of benzene. Wait, but each of those carbons would be connected to the ring, which might not have hydrogens on the carbonyl-adjacent carbons. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure of para-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone oxygens at opposite positions. So each of those ketone groups is attached to a carbon that's part of the benzene ring. So the carbonyl is at position 1 and 4, each connected to a benzene carbon. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the carbons next to the ketone) are actually part of the ring. So those carbons are attached to the benzene ring and a hydrogen. Wait, but the carbon adjacent to the ketone is the same as the ring carbon. So each of those carbons is attached to a hydrogen. So, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbon has a hydrogen. So, for example, if you have O=C-C6H4-C=O, the two carbonyl groups are attached to the ring, and the ring carbons adjacent to them have a hydrogen. So, that would mean that each of those carbonyl groups has an alpha hydrogen (the hydrogen on the adjacent ring carbon). Therefore, benzoquinone should have alpha hydrogens and could undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait a minute. In a benzene ring, the carbons are sp2 hybridized. So each of those adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the carbonyl) are sp2 hybridized, meaning that they have a p orbital for conjugation. So, the carbonyl group is part of the aromatic system. That might affect the possibility of tautomerism. Because for keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha hydrogen needs to be attached to a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. But in this case, the adjacent carbons are part of a conjugated system. Does that prevent tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe the structure being fully conjugated makes the tautomerism impossible because the hydrogen can't move without disrupting the conjugation. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think that tautomerism requires the ability to form an enol, which requires the presence of an alpha hydrogen. So if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, it should undergo tautomerism. But I'm a bit confused.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbonyl groups is attached to the ring carbons. Each of those carbonyl carbons is next to two other ring carbons. Wait, let me think about the structure. The ring is cyclohexane, so all sp3 carbons. Each of the 1,3,5 positions has a carbonyl. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are CH2 groups? No, wait. Each carbonyl is at position 1,3,5. So the structure is like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 in a ring. Wait, no, that's not right. Each carbonyl is attached to the ring, which is in a chair conformation or something. So each ketone is on a ring carbon, and the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups which are attached to other ring carbons. So, each of these ketones has two adjacent CH2 groups, which have hydrogens. So the alpha carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) are CH2, meaning they have two hydrogens each. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione definitely has alpha hydrogens. So it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. So, if both have alpha hydrogens, that's not possible. So perhaps one doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens on those positions. Let me think again. The benzoquinone structure is O=C6H4-C=O. Wait, that's not accurate. The correct structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions. So each ketone is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So each of those carbons is part of the ring and has one hydrogen attached (since in benzene, each carbon has one H). So, the adjacent carbons are the ring carbons, which are attached to a hydrogen. So, the alpha position is the ring carbon next to the carbonyl. So, each ketone has an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but in the case of para-benzoquinone, the structure is:

O=C-(C6H4)-C=O

Each of the carbonyl groups is at a carbon that's part of the ring, which has one hydrogen. So yes, each has an alpha hydrogen. So, why would one of the compounds not show tautomerism?

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the tautomer would be less stable or not possible. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Let me think about the keto-enol form. If the molecule is symmetric, maybe the enol form is the same as the keto form in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, but I thought it does. Alternatively, maybe the structure doesn't allow for the necessary hydrogen shift because of conjugation. Like, in aromatic systems, certain tautomerism might not occur because of the conjugated pi bonds.

Wait, another angle: tautomerism typically occurs in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like in aldoses (like ribose) where keto and enol forms are possible. Alternatively, in quinones, which are conjugated systems, maybe the enol form is not possible because of the planar structure.

Wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, so if it tautomerizes, the enol would have to break the aromaticity. Because the enol form would have a conjugated system that's not fully conjugated, perhaps. So perhaps benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism because that would disrupt the aromatic ring.

Wait, let me think about that. The enol form requires the transfer of a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to the oxygen, creating a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. But in benzoquinone, the alpha carbon is part of the benzene ring. If that hydrogen is removed, could that lead to a conjugated system that's not aromatic? For example, if you take a hydrogen from the carbon next to the carbonyl group (which is part of the benzene ring), moving it to the oxygen would form a double bond. But that would create a structure where the ring isn't fully conjugated anymore. Because the double bond would be in a different position, perhaps disrupting the aromaticity. So, the enol form would not be aromatic, making it less stable. Therefore, the keto form is favored, and tautomerism doesn't occur.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the enol form would create a non-aromatic structure, making it unfavorable. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. Whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because the enol form is possible without disrupting the molecule's structure.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the structure again. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a sp3 carbon. The adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So, each of those has two H's. So when tautomerism occurs, a hydrogen is abstracted from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and moves to the oxygen, creating a double bond between the two carbons. So the structure would change, but the molecule remains cyclohexane-based, just with some double bonds perhaps.

So, if benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the enol form is not possible due to loss of aromaticity, then benzoquinone would be the A (the one that doesn't show tautomerism). So, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck here. I think I remember that quinones, like para-benzoquinone, do not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because the enol form would not be aromatic. So, for part A, the correct answer is that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, making option A) being either option B or D.

Wait, the question says, "does not show tautomerism." So if benzoquinone doesn't show it, then A is benzoquinone. So, looking at the options:

Option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

But the options given are:

Option A: A=cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione; B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A=benzoquinone; B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A=cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione; B=dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A=benzoquinone; B=dimethyl fumarate.

So, if A is benzoquinone, then options B and D are possible.

Now, moving to part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (or another form of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism in some cases). But wait, can geometric isomerism (cis-trans) lead to optical activity? Not necessarily, unless the molecule isn't symmetrical in a way that makes the enantiomers non-superimposable mirror images.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester. Its structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is CH3-O-C(O)-CH2-OH? No, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2COOCH3, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the structure is:

HOCH2-COO-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3CHOHCOOH. Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, actually propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Wait, so the molecule is CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, the structure is:

The acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it properly.

Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Thus, when converted to an ester with methanol, the -OH of the acid is replaced by OMe. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Looking at this structure, is there a chiral center?

CH2(OH) is connected to CH2, which is connected to COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2. Wait, no. Let's number the carbons.

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.

Carbon 3: CH2 connected to carbon 2 and the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. No, wait, because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

When it's converted to methyl ester, it becomes CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the chain is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OMe. So, the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me get it right.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. That is, the OH is on the second carbon (the middle carbon) of the three-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH(OH), with CH3 and COOH attached? Wait, no, the way I'm getting confused is: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be, on the second carbon (the CH2), adding an OH. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the carbon chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, when the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the COOH group and the CH3 group.

When this is esterified with methanol, the acid (COOH) becomes COOCH3, so the structure becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH from the chain. Wait, no. Let me check.

The central carbon: attached to:

1. CH3 (from CH3-CH(OH)-...),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the rest of the molecule).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is the one from the COOCH3 group? No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, the central carbon is the one with the OH. So, what groups are attached?

- One CH3 group,
- One OH group,
- One COOCH3 group,
- And one CH2 group (from the chain beyond the central carbon? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and the next carbon (third carbon) is a carbonyl.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and the carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so perhaps not a substituent).

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (COOCH3), and has an OH group. What about the fourth substituent? Carbon 2 is connected to another carbon? Or is it a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- OH,
- And a single bond to another carbon? Or is it a CH2 group?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because the molecule is straight chain.

Wait, the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- And the hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

Wait a second, that's four substituents? Because carbon 2 is a CH that's connected to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- OH,
- and H.

So, four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H.

That's four different groups attached to the same carbon. So, that carbon is a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, what about dimethyl fumarate?

Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond. Its structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. When it's converted to dimethyl ester, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2CCHCH2CO2H, but wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, actually, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but wait, no: maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Wait, no, wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Let me clarify.

Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Let me get this right.

No, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the two hydroxyl groups (or the two COOH groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, regardless, the dimethyl ester would have the structure where the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, wait.

Wait, the correct structure for fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But arranged in the trans configuration, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this compound have any chiral centers? Let's see.

Each of the carbons in the double bond (the CH and CH) are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups.

Wait, the double bond is between two carbons. Each of those carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two hydrogens. Wait, no, because in the ester, each of the double bond carbons is attached to one COOCH3 group and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the structure is (COOCH3)2C=C. No, wait, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Because fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the two central carbons are each attached to a COOH group. When esterified, they become COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
     || 
     O-C

Wait, no, not quite. Let me think. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(O)OCH3? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, esterification would replace the H in each COOH with OCH3. So, the structure becomes O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(O)OCH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each COOH is converted to COOCH3, so the structure is COOCH3 on each end.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, that can't be right.

Wait, no, in fumaric acid, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are attached to the same carbon. No, that can't be. Because the structure of fumaric acid is two COOH groups on opposite sides of a double bond. So, when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, that's not possible because the double bond can't have two substituents on the same carbon; in fumaric acid, each double bond carbon has a COOH group. So, when esterified, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration.

Now, does this structure have a plane of symmetry? Let me visualize. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So, it's a meso compound. Because if you have two identical groups on either side of the double bond but in a trans configuration, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, what's a meso compound? A meso compound has multiple stereoisomers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two chiral centers but is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, looking at the molecule, it's symmetric across the double bond. So, the molecule is achiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Well, that's a different type of isomerism. But for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or another form of asymmetry causing non-superimposable mirror images.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure would have each carbon attached to two identical groups (since both are COOCH3). So, each carbon is CH2-COOCH3, but connected via a double bond. Wait, no, because in the structure, each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups (like, perhaps, two H's). Wait, no, the structure is CH2-COOCH3 on each end of the double bond. No, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one H. So, the structure is H2C=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that can't be because the formula would be incorrect. Let me think: fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure becomes:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     ||
     O

Wait, that can't be right. No, the correct structure would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides (trans configuration).

So, each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. Wait, no, because in fumaric acid, each double bond carbon has a COOH group. So, when esterified, they become COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

Now, looking for chiral centers, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and maybe a hydrogen or another group). Wait, perhaps the double bond carbons are each attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group, but that's not leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One H,
- And two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, no, the double bond carbons don't have four substituents because they're double-bonded. So, each double bond carbon has three substituents: one COOCH3, one H, and the double bond itself.

Wait, but double bonds don't count as substituents in that sense. So, each double bond carbon is connected to three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other double bond carbon.

But that would make each of these carbons a CH with a double bond. So, each is attached to two identical groups (H and COOCH3), making them not chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the symmetry. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule is symmetric. So, it's a meso compound and hence not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another point: fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. But when esterified, would the ester form have any stereoisomerism?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans compound. So, does it have any stereogenic centers? Each of the double bond carbons has two identical groups (like COOCH3 and H), so they're not chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B is asking which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) does, while dimethyl fumarate (no chiral centers) doesn't.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism because it's a meso compound. So, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows it.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake. Because in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, it's a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism. Whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and option D says B is dimethyl fumarate.

So, if part A is benzoquinone (so A is benzoquinone), and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the answer would be option B. Because option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if that's the case, the answer is option B.

But earlier I thought part A is benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism. So, the correct option would be option B.

But wait, another angle: I thought that for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism. So, in the options, which option has B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate?

Looking again:

Option B: A=benzoquinone, B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, option B is the correct choice for both parts.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking back, the question has two parts:

A) Which does not show tautomerism.

B) Which shows optical isomerism.

So, the correct options would be A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Therefore, the correct option is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens, which can shift between a carbonyl carbon and an adjacent carbon. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Additionally, the enol form of benzoquinone would disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, making tautomerism highly unlikely. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups with alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or another form of stereoisomerism.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (COOCH₃)₂C=CH₂ in the trans configuration. The double bond carbons are each attached to two identical groups (COOCH₃ and H), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
- For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the answers. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about isomers and some compounds. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers, and they're divided into constitutional and stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers have different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like with double bonds or chiral centers.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in different isomers. Like in ketones and aldehydes with alpha hydrogens, they can undergo tautomerism, such as keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone... wait, benzoquinone is a quinone. Quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So for example, para-benzoquinone has two ketones opposite each other.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Let me visualize it. Each of the carbons 1,3,5 has a ketone. So it's a symmetrical structure.

Tautomerism would require the presence of alpha hydrogens, right? Because the keto-enol tautomerism involves moving a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, creating an enol form.

In benzoquinone, each ketone is on the benzene ring. The benzene ring is conjugated, but wait, the carbonyl groups are at the positions. So each carbonyl is attached to two carbons. Do they have alpha hydrogens? Let me think: The carbonyl in benzoquinone is C=O. The adjacent carbons (on the benzene) are attached to other carbons. Wait, no, the quinone structure is like O=C6H4-C=O. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are each part of the benzene ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl. Wait, no, the benzene ring carbons are each connected to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen. Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen. So in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but in reality, each ketone is at the 1 and 4 positions of benzene. Wait, but each of those carbons would be connected to the ring, which might not have hydrogens on the carbonyl-adjacent carbons. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure of para-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone oxygens at opposite positions. So each of those ketone groups is attached to a carbon that's part of the benzene ring. So the carbonyl is at position 1 and 4, each connected to a benzene carbon. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the carbons next to the ketone) are actually part of the ring. So those carbons are attached to the benzene ring and a hydrogen. Wait, but the carbon adjacent to the ketone is the same as the ring carbon. So each of those carbons is attached to a hydrogen. So, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbon has a hydrogen. So, for example, if you have O=C-C6H4-C=O, the two carbonyl groups are attached to the ring, and the ring carbons adjacent to them have a hydrogen. So, that would mean that each of those carbonyl groups has an alpha hydrogen (the hydrogen on the adjacent ring carbon). Therefore, benzoquinone should have alpha hydrogens and could undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait a minute. In a benzene ring, the carbons are sp2 hybridized. So each of those adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the carbonyl) are sp2 hybridized, meaning that they have a p orbital for conjugation. So, the carbonyl group is part of the aromatic system. That might affect the possibility of tautomerism. Because for keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha hydrogen needs to be attached to a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. But in this case, the adjacent carbons are part of a conjugated system. Does that prevent tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe the structure being fully conjugated makes the tautomerism impossible because the hydrogen can't move without disrupting the conjugation. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think that tautomerism requires the ability to form an enol, which requires the presence of an alpha hydrogen. So if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, it should undergo tautomerism. But I'm a bit confused.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbonyl groups is attached to the ring carbons. Each of those carbonyl carbons is next to two other ring carbons. Wait, let me think about the structure. The ring is cyclohexane, so all sp3 carbons. Each of the 1,3,5 positions has a carbonyl. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are CH2 groups? No, wait. Each carbonyl is at position 1,3,5. So the structure is like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 in a ring. Wait, no, that's not right. Each carbonyl is attached to the ring, which is in a chair conformation or something. So each ketone is on a ring carbon, and the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups which are attached to other ring carbons. So, each of these ketones has two adjacent CH2 groups, which have hydrogens. So the alpha carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) are CH2, meaning they have two hydrogens each. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione definitely has alpha hydrogens. So it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. So, if both have alpha hydrogens, that's not possible. So perhaps one doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens on those positions. Let me think again. The benzoquinone structure is O=C6H4-C=O. Wait, that's not accurate. The correct structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions. So each ketone is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So each of those carbons is part of the ring and has one hydrogen attached (since in benzene, each carbon has one H). So, the adjacent carbons are the ring carbons, which are attached to a hydrogen. So, the alpha position is the ring carbon next to the carbonyl. So, each ketone has an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but in the case of para-benzoquinone, the structure is:

O=C-(C6H4)-C=O

Each of the carbonyl groups is at a carbon that's part of the ring, which has one hydrogen. So yes, each has an alpha hydrogen. So, why would one of the compounds not show tautomerism?

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the tautomer would be less stable or not possible. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Let me think about the keto-enol form. If the molecule is symmetric, maybe the enol form is the same as the keto form in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, but I thought it does. Alternatively, maybe the structure doesn't allow for the necessary hydrogen shift because of conjugation. Like, in aromatic systems, certain tautomerism might not occur because of the conjugated pi bonds.

Wait, another angle: tautomerism typically occurs in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like in aldoses (like ribose) where keto and enol forms are possible. Alternatively, in quinones, which are conjugated systems, maybe the enol form is not possible because of the planar structure.

Wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, so if it tautomerizes, the enol would have to break the aromaticity. Because the enol form would have a conjugated system that's not fully conjugated, perhaps. So perhaps benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism because that would disrupt the aromatic ring.

Wait, let me think about that. The enol form requires the transfer of a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to the oxygen, creating a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. But in benzoquinone, the alpha carbon is part of the benzene ring. If that hydrogen is removed, could that lead to a conjugated system that's not aromatic? For example, if you take a hydrogen from the carbon next to the carbonyl group (which is part of the benzene ring), moving it to the oxygen would form a double bond. But that would create a structure where the ring isn't fully conjugated anymore. Because the double bond would be in a different position, perhaps disrupting the aromaticity. So, the enol form would not be aromatic, making it less stable. Therefore, the keto form is favored, and tautomerism doesn't occur.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the enol form would create a non-aromatic structure, making it unfavorable. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. Whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because the enol form is possible without disrupting the molecule's structure.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the structure again. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a sp3 carbon. The adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So, each of those has two H's. So when tautomerism occurs, a hydrogen is abstracted from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and moves to the oxygen, creating a double bond between the two carbons. So the structure would change, but the molecule remains cyclohexane-based, just with some double bonds perhaps.

So, if benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the enol form is not possible due to loss of aromaticity, then benzoquinone would be the A (the one that doesn't show tautomerism). So, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck here. I think I remember that quinones, like para-benzoquinone, do not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because the enol form would not be aromatic. So, for part A, the correct answer is that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, making option A) being either option B or D.

Wait, the question says, "does not show tautomerism." So if benzoquinone doesn't show it, then A is benzoquinone. So, looking at the options:

Option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

But the options given are:

Option A: A=cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione; B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A=benzoquinone; B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A=cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione; B=dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A=benzoquinone; B=dimethyl fumarate.

So, if A is benzoquinone, then options B and D are possible.

Now, moving to part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (or another form of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism in some cases). But wait, can geometric isomerism (cis-trans) lead to optical activity? Not necessarily, unless the molecule isn't symmetrical in a way that makes the enantiomers non-superimposable mirror images.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester. Its structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is CH3-O-C(O)-CH2-OH? No, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2COOCH3, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the structure is:

HOCH2-COO-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3CHOHCOOH. Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, actually propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Wait, so the molecule is CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, the structure is:

The acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it properly.

Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Thus, when converted to an ester with methanol, the -OH of the acid is replaced by OMe. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Looking at this structure, is there a chiral center?

CH2(OH) is connected to CH2, which is connected to COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2. Wait, no. Let's number the carbons.

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.

Carbon 3: CH2 connected to carbon 2 and the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. No, wait, because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

When it's converted to methyl ester, it becomes CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the chain is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OMe. So, the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me get it right.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. That is, the OH is on the second carbon (the middle carbon) of the three-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH(OH), with CH3 and COOH attached? Wait, no, the way I'm getting confused is: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be, on the second carbon (the CH2), adding an OH. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the carbon chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, when the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the COOH group and the CH3 group.

When this is esterified with methanol, the acid (COOH) becomes COOCH3, so the structure becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH from the chain. Wait, no. Let me check.

The central carbon: attached to:

1. CH3 (from CH3-CH(OH)-...),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the rest of the molecule).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is the one from the COOCH3 group? No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, the central carbon is the one with the OH. So, what groups are attached?

- One CH3 group,
- One OH group,
- One COOCH3 group,
- And one CH2 group (from the chain beyond the central carbon? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and the next carbon (third carbon) is a carbonyl.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and the carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so perhaps not a substituent).

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (COOCH3), and has an OH group. What about the fourth substituent? Carbon 2 is connected to another carbon? Or is it a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- OH,
- And a single bond to another carbon? Or is it a CH2 group?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because the molecule is straight chain.

Wait, the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- And the hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

Wait a second, that's four substituents? Because carbon 2 is a CH that's connected to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- OH,
- and H.

So, four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H.

That's four different groups attached to the same carbon. So, that carbon is a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, what about dimethyl fumarate?

Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond. Its structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. When it's converted to dimethyl ester, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2CCHCH2CO2H, but wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, actually, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but wait, no: maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Wait, no, wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Let me clarify.

Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Let me get this right.

No, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the two hydroxyl groups (or the two COOH groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, regardless, the dimethyl ester would have the structure where the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, wait.

Wait, the correct structure for fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But arranged in the trans configuration, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this compound have any chiral centers? Let's see.

Each of the carbons in the double bond (the CH and CH) are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups.

Wait, the double bond is between two carbons. Each of those carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two hydrogens. Wait, no, because in the ester, each of the double bond carbons is attached to one COOCH3 group and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the structure is (COOCH3)2C=C. No, wait, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Because fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the two central carbons are each attached to a COOH group. When esterified, they become COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
     || 
     O-C

Wait, no, not quite. Let me think. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(O)OCH3? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, esterification would replace the H in each COOH with OCH3. So, the structure becomes O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(O)OCH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each COOH is converted to COOCH3, so the structure is COOCH3 on each end.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, that can't be right.

Wait, no, in fumaric acid, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are attached to the same carbon. No, that can't be. Because the structure of fumaric acid is two COOH groups on opposite sides of a double bond. So, when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, that's not possible because the double bond can't have two substituents on the same carbon; in fumaric acid, each double bond carbon has a COOH group. So, when esterified, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration.

Now, does this structure have a plane of symmetry? Let me visualize. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So, it's a meso compound. Because if you have two identical groups on either side of the double bond but in a trans configuration, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, what's a meso compound? A meso compound has multiple stereoisomers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two chiral centers but is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, looking at the molecule, it's symmetric across the double bond. So, the molecule is achiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Well, that's a different type of isomerism. But for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or another form of asymmetry causing non-superimposable mirror images.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure would have each carbon attached to two identical groups (since both are COOCH3). So, each carbon is CH2-COOCH3, but connected via a double bond. Wait, no, because in the structure, each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups (like, perhaps, two H's). Wait, no, the structure is CH2-COOCH3 on each end of the double bond. No, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one H. So, the structure is H2C=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that can't be because the formula would be incorrect. Let me think: fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure becomes:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
     ||
     O

Wait, that can't be right. No, the correct structure would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides (trans configuration).

So, each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. Wait, no, because in fumaric acid, each double bond carbon has a COOH group. So, when esterified, they become COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

Now, looking for chiral centers, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and maybe a hydrogen or another group). Wait, perhaps the double bond carbons are each attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group, but that's not leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One H,
- And two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, no, the double bond carbons don't have four substituents because they're double-bonded. So, each double bond carbon has three substituents: one COOCH3, one H, and the double bond itself.

Wait, but double bonds don't count as substituents in that sense. So, each double bond carbon is connected to three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other double bond carbon.

But that would make each of these carbons a CH with a double bond. So, each is attached to two identical groups (H and COOCH3), making them not chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the symmetry. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule is symmetric. So, it's a meso compound and hence not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another point: fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. But when esterified, would the ester form have any stereoisomerism?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans compound. So, does it have any stereogenic centers? Each of the double bond carbons has two identical groups (like COOCH3 and H), so they're not chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B is asking which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) does, while dimethyl fumarate (no chiral centers) doesn't.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism because it's a meso compound. So, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows it.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake. Because in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, it's a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism. Whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and option D says B is dimethyl fumarate.

So, if part A is benzoquinone (so A is benzoquinone), and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the answer would be option B. Because option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if that's the case, the answer is option B.

But earlier I thought part A is benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism. So, the correct option would be option B.

But wait, another angle: I thought that for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism. So, in the options, which option has B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate?

Looking again:

Option B: A=benzoquinone, B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, option B is the correct choice for both parts.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking back, the question has two parts:

A) Which does not show tautomerism.

B) Which shows optical isomerism.

So, the correct options would be A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Therefore, the correct option is option B.


The question involves determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B) among the given options.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens, which can shift between a carbonyl carbon and an adjacent carbon. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Additionally, the enol form of benzoquinone would disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, making tautomerism highly unlikely. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups with alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or another form of stereoisomerism.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (COOCH₃)₂C=CH₂ in the trans configuration. The double bond carbons are each attached to two identical groups (COOCH₃ and H), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.
