Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbitals. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, since they're in p orbitals. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and the z-component is m=-1.

Wait, but wait. In two-electron systems, when considering orbital angular momentum, each electron has its own l, and the total L is the sum of the two. So for this state, each electron has l1=1 and l2=1, and their sum can range from l=2,1,0. But the state is specified as l=2 and m=-1, so that's the total angular momentum state.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So each Lz measurement for each electron gives -ħ. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the basis here. The given state is a coupled angular momentum state. So it's expressed in terms of the total L and M. But when we measure L1z and L2z, we're looking at the individual z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum.

I remember that the eigenstates of L1z and L2z are the uncoupled basis states. So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be expressed in terms of these individual states to find the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I should express the state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, where m1 is the z-component for electron 1 and m2 for electron 2. Because when you measure L1z and L2z, the system will collapse into one of these product states. So the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the corresponding |m1, m2> state in the given state.

So the given state is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> states that sum to M=-1. Let me list all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

Since each electron has l=1, their m can be -1, 0, +1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to -1:

(-1, 0): because (-1) + 0 = -1.

(0, -1): 0 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, are there others? Let's see. m1 can be 1, but m2 would have to be -2, which isn't possible because m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So only those two possibilities: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, wait. What about (1, -2)? No, because m2 can't be -2. So only two possible product states contribute to this total M state.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. Since these are orthonormal, the state will be a sum of the possible product states, each multiplied by a coefficient.

But wait, I'm a bit shaky on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients here. I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the total states are built from the product states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell us how to express the coupled states in terms of the product states.

The coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = M. So for our case, M is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a sum over all m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the expansion would be:

|1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1, m2; m1+m2=-1} <m1, m2 | 1,1,2,-1> |m1, m2>.

The coefficients <m1, m2 | l1, l2, L, M> are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For our case, l1=l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

Are there any others? Let's see, for m1 + m2 = -1, m1 can't be 1 because m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed. So only these two.

So the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these states can be found. Wait, I think for L=2 and M=-1, the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (something) ) * [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, maybe I should recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is like a spin-1 system). The CG coefficients for adding two spin-1's to get spin 2.

For the state |2, -1>, which is the same as |L=2, M=-1>, the expansion into the product states would involve the combinations where m1 + m2 = -1.

The CG coefficient for each term is given by specific formulas. I think for L=2, each state can be built from the product states as follows.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the states in terms of ladder operators.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to remember that for two spin-1 particles, the possible total spins are 2,1,0. For each possible L, the M values range from -L to +L.

For the |L=2, M=-1> state, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sum over m1, m2 such that m1 +m2 = -1} [ <m1, m2 | 2, -1> ] |m1, m2>.

From what I remember, the coefficients for |m1, m2> when M = m1+m2 = -1 for L=2 would be as follows.

The coefficients are sqrt( ( ( (2*(2+1) )^(1/2) ) * ... )) Hmm, perhaps I should look up the general formula, but I don't have that luxury here.

Alternatively, I can remember that the expansion coefficients can be determined using the formula:

< m1, m2 | L, M> = sqrt( ( (2L + 1) * ( L(L+1) - l1(l1+1) - l2(l2+1) + m1^2 + m2^2 )^{1/2} ) ) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the state |2, -1> is symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, no, because the two electrons are identical particles, but wait no, in this case, we're considering orbital angular momentum, not spin. Oh wait, the question says to ignore spin, so we're only dealing with orbital angular momentum states, which are symmetric under exchange. Because the orbital angular momentum of electrons is symmetric under exchange if the spatial wavefunction is symmetric, but since electrons are fermions, the total wavefunction (which includes spin) must be antisymmetric. But since the problem says to ignore spin, perhaps we can ignore the symmetry here, but maybe not. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to consider the specific coefficients. From memory, the expansion for |2,-1> is a sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each with coefficients sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(2/3), respectively. Or maybe something else.

Wait, wait. Another approach: The state |L=2, M=-1> can be written as a linear combination of the product states where m1 +m2 = -1.

For two l=1 particles, the possible product states with m1 + m2 = -1 are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |m1, m2> in |L, M> is given by:

< m1, m2 | L, M> = (-1)^{L - l1 - l2} / sqrt(2L +1) * something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to refer to a table. I remember that for two spin-1 particles (l=1 each), the |2, -1> state can be expressed as sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by sqrt(2/3). Let me think.

Wait, no, another approach: The expansion coefficients for |2, -1> can be found as:

The state |2, -1> is orthogonal to the |2, -2> and |2, -1> states. Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be built using recursion or ladder operators.

The ladder operator for L+ raises M by 1. So, starting from |2,2>, you can get |2,1> by applying L- once, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expansion for |2, -1> is:

|2, -1> = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: The state |2, -1> would be symmetric under exchange because the two particles are in the same state. Wait, no, the two electrons are identical, but orbital angular momentum is symmetric under exchange, while spin is antisymmetric. But the problem states to ignore spin, so perhaps the state is symmetric.

Wait, that might complicate things. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are both sqrt(2/3) each, so the state is (1/sqrt(3)) (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1>).

Wait, but how can I be sure? I'm a bit stuck here, but perhaps I can proceed.

Assuming the state |2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by a coefficient.

Suppose the state is a combination of these two |m1, m2> states. Let me denote the coefficients as a and b for |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> respectively. Then the state is |2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Because the state is symmetric under exchange (since orbital angular momentum is symmetric), when you swap the two particles, the state should remain the same. So, under exchange, |m1=-1, m2=0> becomes |m1=0, m2=-1>, which is the same as the other term. So the coefficients a and b must be equal. Therefore, a = b.

Now, the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. Since a = b, this becomes 2|a|^2 = 1 → |a|^2 = 1/2 → a = 1/sqrt(2). So each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

So the state |2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, but wait, this can't be correct because when I compute the inner product, the normalization should be correct. Let me check.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because when you couple two l=1 particles, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |2, M> and |0, M> are different. Let me think about the correct expansion.

Wait, another approach: The total number of possible product states for m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M is (2 * (M + 1)) when M is positive, but this might not directly apply. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the possible M values for L=2. For each M, the number of terms in the expansion would vary. For example, |2, 2> would only have one term, |1,1>. |2,1> would have two terms: |1,0> and |0,1>. |2,0> would have three terms: |1,-1>, |0,0>, |-1,1>.

Similarly, |2, -1> would have two terms: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the expansion for |2, -1> would be a linear combination of these two terms.

Assuming the state is symmetric, the coefficients must be equal. So the coefficients are each 1/sqrt(2), because 1/sqrt(2) squared plus 1/sqrt(2) squared equals 1.

So the state is |2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, but wait, that would imply that the probability of each of these product states is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So when you measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

But the question asks for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So L1z eigenvalue is m1 * ħ, and L2z is m2 * ħ.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The orbital angular momentum quantum number m is the eigenvalue of L_z divided by ħ. Oh, right. So L_z |m> = mħ |m>.

So each electron's L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, corresponding to m=-1, 0, +1.

So when the product state is |m1=-1, m2=0>, the L1z measurement gives (-1)ħ and L2z gives 0ħ. So the joint outcome is (-ħ, 0ħ).

In the other product state |m1=0, m2=-1>, L1z gives 0ħ and L2z gives (-1)ħ. So the joint outcome is (0ħ, -ħ).

But the question is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So in the given state |2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, are there any product states where both m1 and m2 are -1?

Looking at the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to M=-1, we saw that m1 can be -1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. There's no state where both m1 and m2 are -1 because that would sum to -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So in the state |2,-1>, there are no components where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

Wait, but the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would have m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't contribute to M=-1. So in the expansion of |2,-1>, this product state is not present.

So the probability is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

To solve this, the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) must be expressed in terms of the uncoupled product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the \( z \)-components of angular momentum for the two electrons. The coupled state is a linear combination of all \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \) states that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). For \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \), the possible \( (m_1, m_2) \) pairs are:

1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

Thus, the coupled state can be written as:

\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = a |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + b |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
\]

The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) are determined by symmetry and normalization. Since the state is symmetric under particle exchange, \( a = b \). Normalization requires \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \), so \( |a|^2 = |b|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the state becomes:

\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right)
\]

The joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) corresponds to the probability of the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \). However, this product state does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), as \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \) in this case. Therefore, the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) state does not contribute to the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \).

Since there is no component of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the given state, the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbitals. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, since they're in p orbitals. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and the z-component is m=-1.

Wait, but wait. In two-electron systems, when considering orbital angular momentum, each electron has its own l, and the total L is the sum of the two. So for this state, each electron has l1=1 and l2=1, and their sum can range from l=2,1,0. But the state is specified as l=2 and m=-1, so that's the total angular momentum state.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So each Lz measurement for each electron gives -ħ. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the basis here. The given state is a coupled angular momentum state. So it's expressed in terms of the total L and M. But when we measure L1z and L2z, we're looking at the individual z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum.

I remember that the eigenstates of L1z and L2z are the uncoupled basis states. So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be expressed in terms of these individual states to find the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I should express the state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, where m1 is the z-component for electron 1 and m2 for electron 2. Because when you measure L1z and L2z, the system will collapse into one of these product states. So the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the corresponding |m1, m2> state in the given state.

So the given state is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> states that sum to M=-1. Let me list all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

Since each electron has l=1, their m can be -1, 0, +1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to -1:

(-1, 0): because (-1) + 0 = -1.

(0, -1): 0 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, are there others? Let's see. m1 can be 1, but m2 would have to be -2, which isn't possible because m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So only those two possibilities: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, wait. What about (1, -2)? No, because m2 can't be -2. So only two possible product states contribute to this total M state.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. Since these are orthonormal, the state will be a sum of the possible product states, each multiplied by a coefficient.

But wait, I'm a bit shaky on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients here. I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the total states are built from the product states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell us how to express the coupled states in terms of the product states.

The coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = M. So for our case, M is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a sum over all m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the expansion would be:

|1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1, m2; m1+m2=-1} <m1, m2 | 1,1,2,-1> |m1, m2>.

The coefficients <m1, m2 | l1, l2, L, M> are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For our case, l1=l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

Are there any others? Let's see, for m1 + m2 = -1, m1 can't be 1 because m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed. So only these two.

So the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these states can be found. Wait, I think for L=2 and M=-1, the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (something) ) * [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, maybe I should recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is like a spin-1 system). The CG coefficients for adding two spin-1's to get spin 2.

For the state |2, -1>, which is the same as |L=2, M=-1>, the expansion into the product states would involve the combinations where m1 + m2 = -1.

The CG coefficient for each term is given by specific formulas. I think for L=2, each state can be built from the product states as follows.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the states in terms of ladder operators.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to remember that for two spin-1 particles, the possible total spins are 2,1,0. For each possible L, the M values range from -L to +L.

For the |L=2, M=-1> state, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sum over m1, m2 such that m1 +m2 = -1} [ <m1, m2 | 2, -1> ] |m1, m2>.

From what I remember, the coefficients for |m1, m2> when M = m1+m2 = -1 for L=2 would be as follows.

The coefficients are sqrt( ( ( (2*(2+1) )^(1/2) ) * ... )) Hmm, perhaps I should look up the general formula, but I don't have that luxury here.

Alternatively, I can remember that the expansion coefficients can be determined using the formula:

< m1, m2 | L, M> = sqrt( ( (2L + 1) * ( L(L+1) - l1(l1+1) - l2(l2+1) + m1^2 + m2^2 )^{1/2} ) ) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the state |2, -1> is symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, no, because the two electrons are identical particles, but wait no, in this case, we're considering orbital angular momentum, not spin. Oh wait, the question says to ignore spin, so we're only dealing with orbital angular momentum states, which are symmetric under exchange. Because the orbital angular momentum of electrons is symmetric under exchange if the spatial wavefunction is symmetric, but since electrons are fermions, the total wavefunction (which includes spin) must be antisymmetric. But since the problem says to ignore spin, perhaps we can ignore the symmetry here, but maybe not. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to consider the specific coefficients. From memory, the expansion for |2,-1> is a sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each with coefficients sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(2/3), respectively. Or maybe something else.

Wait, wait. Another approach: The state |L=2, M=-1> can be written as a linear combination of the product states where m1 +m2 = -1.

For two l=1 particles, the possible product states with m1 + m2 = -1 are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |m1, m2> in |L, M> is given by:

< m1, m2 | L, M> = (-1)^{L - l1 - l2} / sqrt(2L +1) * something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to refer to a table. I remember that for two spin-1 particles (l=1 each), the |2, -1> state can be expressed as sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by sqrt(2/3). Let me think.

Wait, no, another approach: The expansion coefficients for |2, -1> can be found as:

The state |2, -1> is orthogonal to the |2, -2> and |2, -1> states. Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be built using recursion or ladder operators.

The ladder operator for L+ raises M by 1. So, starting from |2,2>, you can get |2,1> by applying L- once, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expansion for |2, -1> is:

|2, -1> = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: The state |2, -1> would be symmetric under exchange because the two particles are in the same state. Wait, no, the two electrons are identical, but orbital angular momentum is symmetric under exchange, while spin is antisymmetric. But the problem states to ignore spin, so perhaps the state is symmetric.

Wait, that might complicate things. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are both sqrt(2/3) each, so the state is (1/sqrt(3)) (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1>).

Wait, but how can I be sure? I'm a bit stuck here, but perhaps I can proceed.

Assuming the state |2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by a coefficient.

Suppose the state is a combination of these two |m1, m2> states. Let me denote the coefficients as a and b for |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> respectively. Then the state is |2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Because the state is symmetric under exchange (since orbital angular momentum is symmetric), when you swap the two particles, the state should remain the same. So, under exchange, |m1=-1, m2=0> becomes |m1=0, m2=-1>, which is the same as the other term. So the coefficients a and b must be equal. Therefore, a = b.

Now, the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. Since a = b, this becomes 2|a|^2 = 1 → |a|^2 = 1/2 → a = 1/sqrt(2). So each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

So the state |2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, but wait, this can't be correct because when I compute the inner product, the normalization should be correct. Let me check.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because when you couple two l=1 particles, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |2, M> and |0, M> are different. Let me think about the correct expansion.

Wait, another approach: The total number of possible product states for m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M is (2 * (M + 1)) when M is positive, but this might not directly apply. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the possible M values for L=2. For each M, the number of terms in the expansion would vary. For example, |2, 2> would only have one term, |1,1>. |2,1> would have two terms: |1,0> and |0,1>. |2,0> would have three terms: |1,-1>, |0,0>, |-1,1>.

Similarly, |2, -1> would have two terms: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the expansion for |2, -1> would be a linear combination of these two terms.

Assuming the state is symmetric, the coefficients must be equal. So the coefficients are each 1/sqrt(2), because 1/sqrt(2) squared plus 1/sqrt(2) squared equals 1.

So the state is |2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Wait, but wait, that would imply that the probability of each of these product states is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So when you measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

But the question asks for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So L1z eigenvalue is m1 * ħ, and L2z is m2 * ħ.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The orbital angular momentum quantum number m is the eigenvalue of L_z divided by ħ. Oh, right. So L_z |m> = mħ |m>.

So each electron's L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, corresponding to m=-1, 0, +1.

So when the product state is |m1=-1, m2=0>, the L1z measurement gives (-1)ħ and L2z gives 0ħ. So the joint outcome is (-ħ, 0ħ).

In the other product state |m1=0, m2=-1>, L1z gives 0ħ and L2z gives (-1)ħ. So the joint outcome is (0ħ, -ħ).

But the question is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So in the given state |2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, are there any product states where both m1 and m2 are -1?

Looking at the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to M=-1, we saw that m1 can be -1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. There's no state where both m1 and m2 are -1 because that would sum to -2, which doesn't match M=-1. So in the state |2,-1>, there are no components where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

Wait, but the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would have m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't contribute to M=-1. So in the expansion of |2,-1>, this product state is not present.

So the probability is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

To solve this, the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) must be expressed in terms of the uncoupled product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the \( z \)-components of angular momentum for the two electrons. The coupled state is a linear combination of all \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \) states that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). For \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \), the possible \( (m_1, m_2) \) pairs are:

1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

Thus, the coupled state can be written as:

\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = a |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + b |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
\]

The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) are determined by symmetry and normalization. Since the state is symmetric under particle exchange, \( a = b \). Normalization requires \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \), so \( |a|^2 = |b|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the state becomes:

\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right)
\]

The joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) corresponds to the probability of the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \). However, this product state does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), as \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \) in this case. Therefore, the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) state does not contribute to the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \).

Since there is no component of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the given state, the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.
