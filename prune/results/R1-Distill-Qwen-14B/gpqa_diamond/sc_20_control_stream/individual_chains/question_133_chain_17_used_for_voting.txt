Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1=7.5x10^-3, Ka2=6.2x10^-8, and Ka3=1.8x10^-12. 

Hmm, okay. So, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? Wait, but wait. Wait, I think orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but sometimes it's broken down into its ions. No, wait. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-? Or is that a different form. Wait, no. Let me think. H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. It can lose three protons:

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-

So, the three species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But wait, in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, it contributes H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (since the formula is Na2HPO4), but with two water molecules. So when it dissolves, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, it contributes HPO4^2-.

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). Now, what about the orthophosphate ion? Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, under normal conditions, especially at pH around neutral, HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are more prevalent than PO4^3-. Because PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, it's usually in more basic solutions.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are the HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the context of phosphate ions, orthophosphate can refer to the H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated, the different forms are called dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4^-), hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-), and phosphate (PO4^3-). So, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

But in a solution that's not extremely basic, PO4^3- isn't the dominant species. So perhaps, we need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution.

Wait, but wait. The solution here contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Are they going to undergo any further dissociation or reaction? Let me think about the pH.

I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, it forms a buffer solution. In this case, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid and base pairs, since H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base). So, this solution is a buffer solution.

The pH of a buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The relevant Ka here is Ka2, which is for H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-. Because Ka1 is H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^-, and Ka2 is H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, in this buffer, the pKa would be pKa2, which is the negative log of 6.2e-8. Let me calculate that: log(6.2e-8) is approximately log(6.2) + log(1e-8). Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 -8= -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21.

So pH = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem isn't directly asking about the pH, but the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be PO4^3-.

Wait, but in the solution, if we have HPO4^2-, does that further dissociate into PO4^3-? Because HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

Ah, right. So in solution, HPO4^2- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become PO4^3- and water. The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

But in the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations. So, knowing the pH, we can find how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to produce PO4^3-.

Wait, but maybe another approach. Let me think about this step by step.

First, calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

We have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Let me compute the moles of each.

Molecular weight (MW) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / MW.

So, moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 1 / 136.09.

Let me compute that: 136.09 is approximately 136.1. 1 / 136.1 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Similarly, the MW of Na2HPO4·2H2O is given as 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

So, in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00734 mol in 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.02805)/(0.0367) ≈ 0.765.

So, log(0.765) is approximately -0.113.

So, pH = 7.21 + (-0.113) ≈ 7.097.

So, approximately 7.10.

Now, with the pH known, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+ as per:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The Ka for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But [H+] can be calculated from pH. Since pH = 7.10, [H+] = 10^-7.10 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, putting in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 7.94e-8.

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Then, divide by 7.94e-8: (5.05e-14)/(7.94e-8) ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = ?

0.02805 is 2.805e-2. So, 1.8e-12 * 2.805e-2 = 5.049e-14.

Then, divide by 7.94e-8: 5.049e-14 / 7.94e-8 = approximately 6.357e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Is this the correct approach?

Another approach: perhaps using the expression for the third dissociation.

The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- + H2O ↔ PO4^3- + H3O+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of dissociation is small. So, the concentration of PO4^3- is small compared to HPO4^2-.

The initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M. Let’s denote the change as x. So, at equilibrium:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 - x ≈ 0.02805 (since x is very small)
[PO4^3-] = x
[H3O+] = sqrt( (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) )

Wait, no, because the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Alternatively, using the expression:

Ka3 = ([PO4^3-][H+]) / [HPO4^2-].

We know [H+] from the pH of 7.10, which is 1e-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is what I did earlier, so the same calculation: (1.8e-12 * 0.02805)/(7.94e-8) ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [H+] or in the numbers.

Wait, let me recalculate the [H+] exactly.

pH = 7.097.

So, [H+] = 10^-7.097 ≈ ?

10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.097 is approximately 0.855. Because 10^-0.1 is about 0.794, so 0.097 is a bit more. Let's compute it more accurately.

Using log tables or calculator: 10^0.097 ≈ 1.255. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 10^0.1 is about 1.2589. 0.097 is 0.1 - 0.003. So 10^0.097 ≈ 1.2589 / 10^0.003 ≈ approx 1.2589 / 1.00695 ≈ 1.249.

Wait, more accurately: 10^0.097.

Let me think in terms of natural logs. Let me compute ln(10^0.097) = 0.097 * ln(10) ≈ 0.097 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2234.

So, e^0.2234 ≈ 1.250.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 1.250 ≈ 1.25e-7 M.

Wait, but earlier I approximated it as 7.94e-8. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, 7.097 is the pH. So, [H+] = 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097).

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.097) is 1/(10^0.097) ≈ 1/1.25 ≈ 0.8.

So, [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.8 = 8e-8 M.

Wait, but wait another way. Let me compute 10^(-7.097) accurately.

7.097 is approximately 7 + 0.097.

So, 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097).

Compute 10^(-0.097):

We can use the Taylor series or logarithm tables. Alternatively, remember that 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, so 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.794.

0.097 is 0.1 - 0.003.

So, 10^(-0.097) ≈ 10^(-0.1 + 0.003) )= 10^(-0.1) * 10^(0.003).

10^(0.003) is approximately 1 + 0.003 * ln(10) ≈ 1 + 0.006908 ≈ 1.006908.

So, 10^(-0.097) ≈ 0.794 * 1.006908 ≈ 0.794 * 1.0069 ≈ approx 0.7997.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.7997 ≈ 7.997e-8 M ≈ 8.0e-8 M.

So, [H+] ≈ 8.0e-8.

So, putting this back into the [PO4^3-] calculation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.0e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.0e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.0e-8 = (5.049 /8) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8 is approx 0.6311.

So, 0.6311e-6 → 6.311e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.31e-7 M, which is close to option A: 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, maybe I made a more precise calculation.

Wait, let me redo the more precise calculation.

Calculate [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[H+] = 10^(-7.097) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.097) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.800 ≈ 8.0e-8 M.

So, plugging in:

(1.8e-12) * (0.02805) = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.0e-8: 5.049e-14 /8e-8 = 6.311e-7 M.

So, approximately 6.31e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Perhaps I need to check if the exact pH calculation is a bit different.

Wait, let me compute the pH more accurately.

The Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.20747.

The ratio is (0.02805)/(0.0367) = 0.7652.

log(0.7652) is approximately log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1) = log(7.65) + log(1e-1) ≈ 0.8847 -1 = -0.1153.

So, pH = 7.20747 -0.1153 ≈ 7.092.

So, pH ≈7.092.

Then, [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ ?

10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).

Compute 10^(-0.092).

We can use logarithm tables or calculator approximations.

Let me compute 10^(-0.092):

ln(10^(-0.092)) = -0.092 * ln(10) ≈ -0.092 *2.302585 ≈ -0.2117.

So, e^(-0.2117) ≈ 0.809.

So, 10^(-0.092) ≈ 0.809.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.809 ≈ 8.09e-8 M.

So, more accurately, 8.09e-8.

Now, let's recalculate [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12) * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.09e-8 → 5.049e-14 /8.09e-8 = (5.049 /8.09) * 1e-6.

5.049 divided by 8.09 is approximately 0.624.

So, 0.624e-6 →6.24e-7 M.

Ah! Now it matches option A which is 6.24e-7 M.

So, the correct answer must be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the provided equilibrium constants.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.00734}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M} \).  

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.00561}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M} \).  

Thus, the initial concentrations are:  
\[
[\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = 0.0367 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = 0.02805 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21.
\]
The ratio of base to acid is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} = \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \approx 0.765.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}\right),
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.21 - 0.115 \approx 7.095.
\]

### Step 3: Relating [PO₄³⁻] to the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄}^{3-} + \text{H}^+.
\]
The equilibrium constant is \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄}^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄}^{3-}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
From the pH, \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.0 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting:  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.0 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805) \approx 5.049 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then divide by \( 8.0 \times 10^{-8} \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.0 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
