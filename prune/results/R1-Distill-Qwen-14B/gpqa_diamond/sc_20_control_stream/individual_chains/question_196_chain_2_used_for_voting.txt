Okay, so I’ve got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play here.

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators, both classical and relativistic.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², which converts into kinetic energy (1/2)mv² at the equilibrium point. So solving for v gives that expression. Looking at the options, option C is that. But this is a relativistic problem, so option C might not be correct.

Wait, but in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. So the energy of the oscillator would be a combination of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the oscillator's total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic) must be conserved, considering relativistic effects.

Hmm, the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator isn't the same as the classical one. The force isn't F = -kx, but I think in relativistic terms, the equation might involve terms with velocity. But the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law F = -kx, implying that the force is treated classically, but the motion is relativistic. Or perhaps the potential is treated classically, but the dynamics are relativistic.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the energy in this system. In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)², where p is momentum. But for oscillators, maybe the potential energy contributes to the total energy.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. But in relativity, I'm not sure if that's the same. Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think about the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian for a relativistic oscillator. The Lagrangian for a relativistic particle is L = -m c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - (1/2)k x². Hmm, that sounds familiar. So the Lagrangian combines the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential from Hooke's law.

To find the equations of motion, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation: d/dt (∂L/∂v) - ∂L/∂x = 0.

Let me compute ∂L/∂v. L is -m c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - (1/2)k x². So the derivative with respect to v is [d/dv (-m c² (1 - v²/c²)^0.5 ) ] = (m c²) * (1/(2)) (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2) * (2v/c²) ) = (m v ) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So ∂L/∂v = (m v ) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Then, d/dt of that term. Let's compute d/dt [ (m v)/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ].

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me denote u = v. Then,

d/dt [ (m u) / sqrt(1 - u²/c²) ) ].

Let me compute the derivative:

= m [ (1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²)) + u * (1/(2)) (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2) * (2u/c²) ) ] * du/dt.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me redo it. The derivative of [u / sqrt(1 - u²/c²)] with respect to time is:

d/dt [ u (1 - u²/c²)^(-1/2) ) ]

Using product rule:

= (du/dt) (1 - u²/c²)^(-1/2) + u * (-1/2) (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2) * (-2u/c²) du/dt.

Simplify each term:

First term: (du/dt) * (1 - u²/c²)^(-1/2).

Second term: u * (1/2) * (2u/c²) (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2) ) du/dt.

Simplify second term:

= u^2 (1/c²) (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2) ) du/dt.

So overall, the derivative is:

= (du/dt) [ (1 - u²/c²)^(-1/2) + (u²/c²) (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2) ) ].

Factor out (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2):

= (du/dt) (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2) [ (1 - u²/c²) + u²/c² ) ].

The terms inside the bracket simplify to 1. So the derivative becomes:

= (du/dt) * (1 - u²/c²)^(-3/2).

So putting it all together, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:

d/dt [ (m v ) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) ] - (-k x ) = 0.

So,

m (dv/dt) (1 - v²/c²)^(-3/2) + k x = 0.

Hmm, but that's the equation of motion. It looks more complicated than the classical F = -kx. Maybe it's not the easiest way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about energy conservation. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest mass energy and the potential energy from the spring, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)k A², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. But in relativity, perhaps the potential energy is similar, but the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, no. The rest mass energy is mc², but when the oscillator is moving, its total energy increases. Hmm, perhaps the total energy is a sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, but that may not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)k x² as before, but the total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: suppose the oscillator's total energy E is conserved. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At x=0, the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², but (γ - 1) m c², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's model it that way.

At x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + m c²? Because the rest energy is mc² and the potential adds (1/2)k A²? Or is it just the potential energy?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But when relativistic effects are considered, the kinetic energy part changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E (including rest mass energy) is equal to the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c², so the total energy E is:

E = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Wait, no, because when x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So, at x=0, E = K = (γ - 1) m c².

At x = A, all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that would imply (1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c² when x=0, but that can't be right because E would have to be the same in both cases.

Wait, no, maybe E is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is just the rest energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is max, so the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c², and the potential is zero. So E = (γ - 1) m c² + 0. But then we have:

(γ - 1) m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, that can't be correct, because the left side is (γ - 1) m c², which is the kinetic energy, but the right side would be E = mc² + (1/2)k A². That would imply the kinetic energy equals E, which is mc² + (1/2)kA², so:

(γ - 1) m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But that would imply γ = 1 + (1/(m c²)) (mc² + (1/2)k A²) ) = 1 + 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ? That doesn't make much sense. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption about the total energy is wrong.

Wait, maybe the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So when x = A, E = mc² + (1/2) k A². When x = 0, E = K + mc², where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

So, E = K + mc² = (γ - 1) m c² + mc² = γ m c².

So setting them equal: γ m c² = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which we can write as:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Solving for v:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ].

Take the square root:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ] ).

Wait, let's compute that expression. Let me let term = (k A²)/(2 m c²) ). So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + term )² ] )

Simplify inside the square root:

= [ (1 + term )² - 1 ] / (1 + term )²

= [1 + 2 term + term² -1 ] / (1 + term )²

= [ 2 term + term^2 ] / (1 + term )^2

Factor term:

= term (2 + term ) / (1 + term )^2.

Wait, but term is (k A²)/(2 m c² ). If this term is small compared to 1, which might be the case for non-relativistic speeds, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, but let's see the options. Looking at the options:

Option D is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches what I have here, except my expression is the same as option D.

Wait, let me check: option D says v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I derived. So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, let's double-check the other options. Option B has 1 - 1/( ... ), but inside the sqrt, but the denominator is (1 - ... ), which doesn't fit.

Option A has sqrt(1 + 1/(...)), but that would make v greater than c, which can't be right because you can't exceed the speed of light.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which is not applicable here.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system is conserved and includes the rest energy, potential energy, and relativistic kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely relativistic kinetic energy:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we get:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Solving for \( v_{\text{max}}^2 \):

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it suggests \( v_{\text{max}} > c \), which violates the speed limit in relativity.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the denominator inside the square root does not match the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it represents the non-relativistic case, which does not apply here.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
