Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the problem says we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we're supposed to mix them all together. The question is asking for the enthalpy change, specifically the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value I remember is around -57 kJ per mole for strong acids and bases, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh right, the enthalpy change is usually exothermic, so the value should be negative.

But wait, this isn't a simple acid-base reaction. There are two acids and one base here. So I need to figure out first what the net reaction is going to be. Because when you mix acids and bases, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base.

Let me calculate the moles of each substance involved.

Starting with HCl. It's a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So for each mole of HCl, we get one mole of H+.

Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid as well, but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions per molecule. So the reaction is H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Let's think about that. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives two moles of OH-.

Molarity is 0.5 M, volume is 0.2 L. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so moles of OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react: H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

The amount of H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here. All the OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the moles of H2O formed would be equal to the moles of OH-, which is 0.2 mol.

Alternatively, the neutralization reaction would produce 0.2 mol of H2O, and the excess H+ would be 0.08 mol (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, the excess H+ might not affect the enthalpy calculation because the enthalpy per mole of H2O is standard.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released per mole of H2O formed. So the total enthalpy change would be the moles of water formed multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, I should confirm whether this is a strong acid and strong base scenario. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is strong (but since it's a diprotic acid, the first dissociation is complete, the second is also strong, I think). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So all the H+ and OH- should react completely, except for the excess H+.

So the moles of H2O formed are 0.2 mol. Since each mole of H2O formation releases about 57 kJ (or is it 57 kJ per mole?), but wait, actually I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.1 kJ per mole for strong acid and strong base. Wait, but wait—H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+ ions. But the enthalpy for each H+ is about half of that? Or no, because the enthalpy per mole of H+ is the same regardless of the acid.

Wait, maybe I should think of each mole of H+ reacting with a mole of OH- to form H2O. So each such reaction releases 57.1 kJ, but only if it's a strong acid and strong base.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+. But each of those H+ reacts with OH- to form H2O. So each mole of H+ contributes to the enthalpy.

So in total, the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

So the reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- combining to form 0.2 moles of H2O. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.1 kJ/mol).

Wait, but wait, some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole, so 57.3 kJ is the magnitude. So in this case, 0.2 moles would give 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative, so -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, 11.46 kJ is approximately 11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. But option B is -11.42 kcal. So that's a different unit.

Wait, let's think about the units. Oh, the problem might be using calories, but the standard enthalpy is in kJ. Alternatively, perhaps I need to convert the result into kcal.

Wait, but wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if the enthalpy is 11.46 kJ, that's about 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. But wait, no, because the enthalpy change is in kJ, but the options have kcal and kJ. Let me think again.

Wait, the neutralization enthalpy per mole is about -57.3 kJ/mol, which is -57,300 J. To convert to kcal, 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57,300 J is about 57,300 / 4184 ≈ 13.68 kcal. Wait, that's per mole. So perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me restate the problem.

The neutralization reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O. Each mole releases 57.3 kJ, so 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ because it's exothermic.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than our calculated 11.46, so that's not it. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's in kilocalories. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kilocalories, but I thought the standard unit was kJ.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

The moles of water formed is 0.2 mol.

Each mole of water forms is accompanied by a release of 57.3 kJ (from strong acid and base). So 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ released.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (since 1 kJ is ~0.239 kcal). So 11.46 kJ is 11.46 * 0.239 ≈ 2.74 kcal. But that's not any of the options either.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the enthalpy per mole. Wait, maybe the enthalpy per mole is in kcal. Let me think. Oh, wait, in some textbooks, the enthalpy of neutralization is given as about -13.68 kcal/mol. Because 57.3 kJ is about 13.68 kcal (since 57,300 J / 4,184 J/kcal ≈ 13.68 kcal). So each mole produces about -13.68 kcal.

So then, 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × (-13.68) = -2.736 kcal, which is approximately -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's close, but why is option B about -11.42 kcal?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it donates two H+ ions. However, Ba(OH)2 also provides two OH- ions per formula unit. So when you mix all three solutions, perhaps some other reaction is happening, like a precipitation?

Hmm, wait, when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, you can get a double displacement reaction. Let me consider that.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

But wait, BaSO4 is a precipitate. So perhaps some of the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, which would precipitate out. And the rest of the H+ would come from HCl and any excess H+ from the H2SO4 not involved in the precipitation.

So this complicates things. Because in that case, the neutralization isn't just between H+ and OH-, but some of the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2 to form a precipitate.

So I need to calculate both reactions: the neutralization of some H+ with OH- and the formation of BaSO4.

Hmm, this changes the approach. Let me think again.

First, identify all possible reactions.

1. Neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O.

2. Precipitation: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

So the first step is to see if any of the reactants can form a precipitate. Since BaSO4 is insoluble, any reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 will produce it.

So how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 do we have? Let me find the moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

The reaction is 1:1 between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, because the formula is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 is needed.

So H2SO4 is 0.09 mol, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So all 0.09 mol of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol of Ba(OH)2 to form 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1:1 for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, producing 1 mole of BaSO4 and 2 moles of H2O.

So after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Now, the H+ from HCl and the remaining H+ from H2SO4 will react with the remaining OH- from Ba(OH)2 and any excess OH-.

Wait, let's break this down step by step.

First, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol

H2SO4 is limiting, so after reaction:

H2SO4: 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2 used: 0.09 mol. Remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Products: 0.09 mol BaSO4 (precipitate) and 0.18 mol H2O.

So in solution, after this reaction, the remaining substances are:

- HCl: 0.1 mol H+ (from earlier calculation, because HCl is a strong acid and fully dissociates).

- H2SO4: all used up in the reaction, so no more H+ from it except for any that might have been involved in the neutralization.

Wait, no, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it donates both H+ ions before reacting with Ba(OH)2. So when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, the H+ and OH- from both are consumed.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering all the H+ and OH- ions in solution before any reactions.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated, perhaps I should make a table of all the ions present.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- before any reactions, then determine how they react.

But wait, when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, some of the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react to form water. But the reaction also produces BaSO4 precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first determine the moles of H+ and OH- from all solutions, then calculate how much neutralization occurs, considering any precipitation.

Let me think again.

First, let's calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions before any reactions.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

If they were to neutralize, the OH- would neutralize 0.2 mol of H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

But wait, but H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 can react to form BaSO4 precipitate, which would consume some H+ and OH-.

So when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they can react to form BaSO4(s) and water.

The reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

The mole ratio is 1:1.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is limiting, as before.

So in this reaction, 0.09 mol of H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol of Ba(OH)2 to produce 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 donates 2 H+; each mole of Ba(OH)2 donates 2 OH-.

Wait, but in the reaction, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are reacting in a 1:1 ratio, so each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So the H+ and OH- from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 in this reaction would combine to form H2O.

So in this 0.09 mol reaction, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+ from H2SO4, and 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH- from Ba(OH)2, which would combine to form 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but that's already accounted for in the neutralization.

But wait, this is part of the overall neutralization. So after this reaction, the remaining H+ and OH- would be from HCl and any excess Ba(OH)2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should handle this more systematically.

Let me consider all the H+ and OH- ions from all the solutions, then determine how much neutralization occurs, considering any precipitation.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of moles.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

Total H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

But before any neutralization, some of the H+ and OH- from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 may react to form BaSO4 and water.

Wait, but the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is a neutralization reaction that produces BaSO4 precipitate. So for each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of H2O and 1 mole of BaSO4.

So let me calculate how much of each is present.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

They react in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.09 mol of H2SO4 and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 are consumed, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

After this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Now, the remaining H+ comes from HCl and any excess H2SO4, but since H2SO4 was the limiting reactant, all of it is consumed in the reaction with Ba(OH)2. So the only H+ left is from HCl: 0.1 mol.

The remaining OH- comes from the excess Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.02 mol OH-.

Wait, no. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole gives 2 OH-. So 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.02 mol OH-.

So now, the remaining H+ is 0.1 mol (from HCl) and the remaining OH- is 0.02 mol.

These will then neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So neutralization reaction: 0.1 mol H+ and 0.02 mol OH- will react.

The OH- is 0.02 mol, so all of it will react, consuming 0.02 mol H+.

The moles of H2O formed from this neutralization is 0.02 mol.

So total moles of H2O formed are:

From the Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 reaction: 0.18 mol.

From the HCl and excess Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

Total H2O: 0.2 mol.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about it, I had 0.2 mol H2O. But according to this, it's 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.2 mol. So same result.

Each mole of H2O formation releases 57.3 kJ (exothermic), so 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.46 kJ is 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.74 kcal (since 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal). So 11.46 × 0.239 ≈ 2.74 kcal. But none of the options match that. Wait, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close to this.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the enthalpy change as per mole of H2O, but in reality, the formation of BaSO4 is also exothermic. So the total enthalpy change would include both the formation of BaSO4 and the neutralization of H+ and OH-.

Ah, that's a point I forgot. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 is also an exothermic process, and its enthalpy change should be considered.

So I need to calculate the enthalpy change for both reactions: the neutralization and the precipitation.

Hmm, this complicates things because I now have to consider the enthalpy change for the formation of BaSO4.

But wait, without knowing the specific enthalpy changes for each reaction, it's difficult. However, in typical problems like this, sometimes only the neutralization part is considered, and precipitations are ignored for simplicity. But given the options, perhaps the precipitation is important here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be a simple neutralization, ignoring any precipitation, but that would have been a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- as before, without considering the precipitation. Let's go back to the initial approach.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

They neutralize to form 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, not matching.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert 11.46 kJ to kcal:

1 kJ = 0.239 kcal (approx).

11.46 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.74 kcal, so the enthalpy change would be -2.74 kcal, which is closest to option A (-2.72 kcal). But why is option B -11.42 kcal?

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the problem expects us to consider the neutralization of each H+ with OH- without considering precipitation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each acid separately.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. The neutralization will produce 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. But option B is -11.42 kcal. So if the problem expects the answer in kcal, perhaps 11.46 kJ is approximately 11.46 × 0.239 = 2.74 kcal, but that's not an option. Wait, unless I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing kJ and kcal. Let me think: 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So if I have an enthalpy change of -11.46 kJ, that's approximately -11.46 /4.184 ≈ -2.735 kcal, which is about -2.74 kcal. So the closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But earlier, when I considered the precipitation, I ended up with the same amount of H2O (0.2 mol), so the same enthalpy change. So perhaps the precipitation does not affect the moles of H2O formed, hence the same calculation applies.

So the correct answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ or -2.74 kcal. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are given in both kcal and kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is presented in kcal, but the calculation is in kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization enthalpy is taken as approximately 57.3 kcal per mole. Because 57.3 kJ is about 13.68 kcal (since 57.3 × 1000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.68 kcal). So if each mole of H2O releases 13.68 kcal, then 0.2 mol would release 0.2 ×13.68 = 2.736 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.736 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

So perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, but why would the neutralization enthalpy be 57.3 kJ/mol? Because in some references, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol, which is about -13.68 kcal/mol. So 0.2 mol would give about 2.736 kcal.

So the answer would be approximately -2.736 kcal, which corresponds to option A (-2.72 kcal).

But wait, why is option B (-11.42 kcal) present? Maybe I made a mistake in considering the total moles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and then find the neutralization.

Wait, another thought: when Ba(OH)2 is present, and H2SO4 is present, perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces more H2O, thus contributing more to the neutralization.

Wait, the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O releases 2 moles of H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H2O, which would account for more enthalpy.

But if I consider that, then the moles of H2O would be 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 from that reaction, plus any from neutralization.

But wait, earlier I accounted for 0.18 mol from that reaction and 0.02 mol from neutralization, totaling 0.2.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So if the question expects the answer in kJ, none of the options match except D, which is -16 kJ, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem might not consider the precipitation and just take the total H+ and OH- to find the moles of H2O.

In that case, the moles of H2O would be 0.2 mol, enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, close to 11.46 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is approximately 11.46 × 0.239 = 2.736 kcal. Not matching option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try to calculate each step again.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

Moles of H+ from H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol, but since it's diprotic, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol, each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

The neutralization reaction will consume 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching.

But wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, and I'm miscalculating the conversion.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is equal to 11.46 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.736 kcal.

But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So maybe the correct answer is option A.

But why is option B present? Let me see the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as 11.46 kJ (since 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal, not 11.42 kcal). So option B must be incorrect in this context.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the neutralization of each acid separately.

HCl reacts with OH-: 0.1 mol H+ → 0.1 mol H2O → 0.1 ×57.3 = 5.73 kJ.

H2SO4 reacts with OH-: 0.18 ×57.3 = 10.314 kJ.

Total: 5.73 +10.314 =16.044 kJ → approximately 16.0 kJ. But that's not matching any option except D (-16.0 kJ).

Wait, but that would be when all H+ reacts, but in reality, OH- is only 0.2 mol, so not all H+ can react.

Wait, no, that approach would be incorrect because the neutralization is a 1:1 reaction between H+ and OH-.

So the correct approach is to find the limiting reagent between H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So OH- is limiting. So only 0.2 mol H+ reacts, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is not an option. Wait, looking at the options again, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the H+ and OH- react, which is not the case. But that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both fully dissociate, and all H+ and OH- are available for reaction.

So moles of H+ = 0.28, OH- =0.2.

The neutralization would produce 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be about -11.5 kJ, but the options don't have that. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as 11.46 kJ in kcal.

Wait, because 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and then use the enthalpy per mole of acid or base.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ is about -57.3 kJ/mol. So the total enthalpy change is (moles of H+) × (-57.3 kJ/mol).

But no, that's not correct because only the moles that react contribute.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct enthalpy change should be about -11.46 kJ, which isn't an option. The closest option in kJ is D) -16.0 kJ, which is not correct. Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in kcal, then option A (-2.72 kcal) is close to the correct value of -2.74 kcal.

But another possibility is that the problem expects the answer to be based on the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 only, ignoring HCl.

Wait, no, that can't be. The HCl is part of the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy change per mole of reaction, not per mole of H2O.

Wait, the reaction when all three solutions are mixed would be:

HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → ?

But that's a bit complicated. Let me write the overall reaction.

HCl: H+ + Cl-.

H2SO4: 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2: Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

When mixed, the H+ and OH- will react to form H2O, and any possible precipitates.

The possible precipitate is BaSO4, which forms from SO4^2- and Ba^2+.

So the ions in solution are:

H+, Cl-, SO4^2-, Ba^2+, OH-.

The possible reactions are:

1. Neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O.

2. Precipitation: Ba^2+ + SO4^2- → BaSO4(s).

So first, the Ba^2+ and SO4^2- will react to form BaSO4.

Moles of Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol (since 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 mol Ba^2+).

Moles of SO4^2- from H2SO4: 0.09 mol (each H2SO4 gives one SO4^2-).

So Ba^2+ is in excess because 0.1 mol Ba^2+ and 0.09 mol SO4^2-.

They will react in a 1:1 ratio, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and leaving 0.01 mol Ba^2+.

Now, the remaining ions are:

H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Cl^-: 0.1 mol (from HCl).

SO4^2-: 0 mol (all reacted).

Ba^2+: 0.01 mol.

OH^-: 0.2 mol.

Now, the OH- will react with H+.

Total OH-: 0.2 mol.

H+ available: 0.28 mol.

OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

The neutralization produces 0.2 mol H2O.

So total moles of H2O formed: 0.2 mol.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as 11.46 kJ in kcal. Because 11.46 kJ equals about 2.74 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recalculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the precipitation and just calculates the neutralization based on the initial H+ and OH-.

In that case, the neutralization produces 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 11.46 kJ.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B (-11.42 kcal), but that would require the enthalpy change to be approximately -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.5 kJ (11.42 ×4.184 ≈47.5 kJ). But our calculation is 11.46 kJ, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of acid-base neutralization, not per mole of H2O.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is considered per mole of H+ and OH-.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps the intended answer is option B (-11.42 kcal), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute 0.2 moles multiplied by 57.3 kJ.

0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ = 11.46 kJ.

In kcal, that's 11.46 /4.184 ≈2.736 kcal.

So the correct answer should be -2.74 kcal, which is not an option, but option A is -2.72 kcal. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in kJ, and the closest option is not present.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the correct answer is 11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ, but the options don't have that. However, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is 11.42 kcal = about 47.5 kJ, which is much higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done per mole of H+ from each acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be in kcal, so let me re-calculate:

If 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, and each mole releases 13.68 kcal (since 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.68 kcal), then 0.2 ×13.68= 2.736 kcal. So -2.74 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal).

Thus, the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **HCl**: HCl dissociates completely, contributing 1 H⁺ per mole.  
  Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

- **H₂SO₄**: H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, contributing 2 H⁺ per mole.  
  Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Ba(OH)₂**: Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing 2 OH⁻ per mole.  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
The H⁺ and OH⁻ ions react in a 1:1 ratio to form water:  
\[
\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
\]

- Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, all \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ to form \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O. The remaining \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ does not participate in the reaction.

### Step 3: Enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.68 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O formed:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]
Converting to kcal:  
\[
-11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: This would correspond to \( 11.42 \, \text{kcal} \), which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Too far from the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: This corresponds to \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \), which is higher than the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it is the closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \). 

Answer: A
