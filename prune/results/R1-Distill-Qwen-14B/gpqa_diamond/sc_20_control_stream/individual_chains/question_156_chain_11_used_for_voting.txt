Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used as epoxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, I think reacting an alkene with mCPBA would form an epoxide.

Wait, but what about the stereochemistry? Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond, and this addition is stereospecific. The reaction is a peracid epoxidation, which typically proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. So, the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Let me think about Reaction 1. The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene. When mCPBA reacts with an E-alkene, the epoxide formed would have which configuration? I remember that the epoxidation with mCPBA is a concerted process, so the stereochemistry of the double bond is retained. So, in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. After epoxidation, the oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry is preserved. So, the epoxide will have a trans configuration because the starting alkene was E (trans).

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The double bond in (E)-oct-4-ene has the higher priority groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The addition is such that the two new oxygen atoms form a bridge across the former double bond. So, for E-alkene, the two substituents (like CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. So, the epoxide would have these substituents on opposite sides as well. So the epoxide from E-oct-4-ene would have a trans configuration.

Similarly, for Reaction 2, we have (Z)-oct-4-ene. The substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide formed here would have the substituents on the same side, making it a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, mCPBA is a peracid, and the epoxidation is an electrocyclic reaction. It's a concerted process where the peracid attacks the double bond from one face, leading to a transition state that forms the epoxide. Since the starting double bond is either E or Z, the resulting epoxide's substituents will depend on that.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene becomes trans-epoxide, let's say trans-oct-4-ene oxide.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene becomes cis-epoxide, cis-oct-4-ene oxide.

Now, after forming the epoxides, the next step is treatment with aqueous acid. I remember that acid catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. The mechanism usually involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group (but wait, in ring-opening, it's more about the attack by a nucleophile). So, in acidic conditions, the epoxide opens via a protonation, followed by attack by a water molecule (or in this case, since it's aqueous acid, maybe it's water acting as a nucleophile).

In acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized. Wait, or is it the less substituted? No, wait, in acid conditions, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation is more stable there.

Wait, the mechanism: in acid, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the ring more electrophilic. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the less hindered carbon. Wait, no, wait. For asymmetric epoxides, the attack can be either from the same side (leading to trans diol) or opposite (leading to cis diol), depending on the conditions. Wait, in acid conditions, the ring opening is typically more likely to proceed with SN2-like attack, leading to the anti addition of the nucleophile.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the ring-opening of epoxides under acid conditions, the oxygen gets protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then, the nucleophile (like water) attacks the less substituted carbon from the opposite side, because the transition state is more SN2-like. Wait, or is it attack from the same side because the epoxide becomes a better electrophile?

Alternatively, another way: when the epoxide is in acid, the ring opens to form a carbocation. Wait, no, that's more under different conditions. Acid catalyzed ring opening of epoxides typically involves a two-step process: initial protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens, leading to a transition state where the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon, perhaps leading to a carbocation, which would then be attacked by the nucleophile.

Wait, maybe I should think about this more clearly. In acidic conditions, the epoxide ring is protonated, which makes the oxygen positively charged, and the adjacent carbons become more electrophilic. The nucleophile attacks one of these carbons. The attack happens from the opposite side of the leaving oxygen (since it's an SN2-like mechanism). So, the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon, which is more accessible, because the more substituted carbocation is more stable.

Wait, no. Wait, no, in the epoxide, each carbon is attached to two other carbons (since it's a three-membered ring). So, the attack is more likely on the carbon which is less substituted because that would form a more stable transition state.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific structures.

Let's imagine the epoxide for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene becomes trans-4,5-epoxyoctane.

The structure would be:

CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2CH2 is on carbons 4 and 5. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octane is 8 carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on carbons 4 and 5.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but double bond is between C4 and C5.

Wait, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let's number from left to right.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2- groups on C4 and C5, so:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, octane has 8 carbons. So, oct-4-ene would be:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, where the double bond is between C4 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with double bond between C4 and C5. So, the substituents on each side of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of the structure of the epoxide.

After epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two substituents (like the two CH2 groups) on opposite sides, making the epoxide trans.

Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide would ring-open. In acid, the ring opening is likely to proceed via a protonation followed by nucleophilic attack. So, the attack is from the opposite side (SN2-like), leading to the formation of a diol, but with the stereochemistry determined by the starting epoxide.

Wait, but the diol would have a certain configuration. Let me think: if the epoxide is trans, how does the ring opening proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomerism comes from the ring-opening of the epoxide. Let me consider each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → upon acid treatment → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → upon acid treatment → diol.

Wait, when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The opening can lead to different diastereomers depending on the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, but for each epoxide, what happens during ring opening?

In the case of a trans epoxide, the ring opening would lead to a diol with a certain configuration. If the attack is from the same face, then the diol would have a certain stereoisomerism. Alternatively, maybe the diol can form two different products, but wait, in the case of a symmetrical epoxide, perhaps the diol would be the same.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the products are.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide. When treated with aqueous acid, the trans-epoxide would ring-open to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric (because oct-4-ene is symmetric?), wait, is oct-4-ene symmetric?

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene structure is CH2CH2 on C4 and C5, but let me count again.

Octane has 8 carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, so the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's more accurate to think that each end is a CH2 group attached to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5, so each end is a CH2 connected to longer chains. So, each side of the epoxide is a CH2CH2 and a CH2CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me think about the product.

When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it will form a diol. The key point is whether the diol has stereoisomers. So, for each epoxide, after ring opening, how many stereoisomers are formed.

Wait, let's think for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide. When the epoxide opens in acid, each oxygen is on a carbon that's part of a longer chain. Because the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the diol formed is a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is symmetric, leading to the same product regardless of attack direction. Wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the attack from either side would lead to the same diol.

Wait, let's imagine the structure of the trans-epoxide. Each carbon of the epoxide is connected to two identical groups. For example, each carbon is connected to two CH2 groups. So, the epoxide is symmetric.

In that case, when the epoxide ring opens, the two possible attack positions (each carbon) are identical. So, the attack on either carbon would lead to the same diol. Thus, the diol would be meso or something that's not chiral.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the diol structure. If the epoxide is symmetric (each carbon has identical groups), then the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. Let's say the structure is HOCH2CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not exactly correct.

Wait, the actual structure would be HO-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, each attached to two CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the diol would be HOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2OH, but that's a straight chain. But in reality, the diol would be HO-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-OH? No, perhaps not. Let me try to think in terms of the epoxide opening.

The epoxide is between C4 and C5 of octane. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2 (but actually, it's a three-membered ring, so it's more like a bridge between C4 and C5). So, C4 is connected to C5 via an oxygen bridge.

When the epoxide opens, two hydroxyl groups are added to C4 and C5.

Wait, in octane, the positions are:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

In (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on each end are opposite (so, higher priority groups are opposite). So, when epoxidized, the substituents on each end of the epoxide are opposite.

Then, when treated with acid, the epoxide opens. If the epoxide is symmetric, then the attack of water from either side would result in the same diol. So for the trans-epoxide, the diol would be a single compound, perhaps a meso compound.

Similarly, for the cis-epoxide (from Z-oct-4-ene), when treated with acid, the attack would lead to the same diol if the structure is symmetric. Wait, but if the epoxide is cis, the substituents are on the same side. However, if the structure is symmetric, perhaps the diol is also a single compound.

Wait a minute. Let me think about the symmetry. If the epoxide is symmetric, like in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, then each end of the epoxide is the same. So, when the epoxide opens, regardless of which carbon is attacked first, the resulting diol would have the same configuration.

Wait, but let's think about the actual product. For the trans-epoxide, when the ring opens, the two hydroxyl groups would end up on the same side or opposite sides?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the trans-epoxide would have a certain configuration, and the diol from the cis-epoxide would have a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps both reactions lead to the same diol. No, that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different. Or perhaps they form different diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a pair of diastereomers, but given that the starting material is enantiomerically pure, perhaps the diols are also enantioenriched.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it differently.

After epoxidation, each starting material (E and Z) forms an epoxide with either trans or cis configuration. Then, each is treated with aqueous acid, which opens the epoxide to form a diol.

Now, the key is whether the diols are the same or different, and whether they have stereoisomers.

Wait, for each epoxide, when opened, does it form a single diol or multiple stereoisomers?

Assuming the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single compound. For example, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, but in a meso form, making it achiral.

Wait, so in the case of Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → upon acid treatment → meso diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → upon acid treatment → another meso diol?

Wait, but wait. If the starting epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, which is achiral. So, both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would produce the same meso diol?

No, because the starting epoxides are different. Wait, no, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be the same regardless of whether the epoxide was cis or trans? Or no?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take cyclohexene. When you epoxidize cyclohexene (cis), and then treat it with acid, you get a diol. But in our case, the epoxide is on oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric molecule.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric because the substituents on either end of the double bond are identical. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH2CH2 groups. Therefore, the epoxide formed would be a symmetric trans epoxide, and upon ring opening, it would form a symmetric diol, which is a meso compound, thus achiral.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is also symmetric because the substituents are the same, but in a cis configuration. So, when treated with acid, it would also form a symmetric diol, which is also a meso compound, thus achiral.

Wait, so both reactions would produce the same meso diol? No, because the epoxide is different. Wait, no, because the starting epoxide is symmetric in both cases. So, regardless of whether the epoxide is cis or trans, the diol would be the same.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, which are geometric isomers. But if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol ends up being the same in both cases.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have two identical substituents on either end. So, for both E and Z, the diol would be the same. So, each reaction would produce the same diol, which is a single compound.

But that can't be correct because the epoxide starting materials are different. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diol. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the diol from the trans-epoxide is different from the diol from the cis-epoxide. Because the way the epoxide opens would lead to different configurations.

Wait, suppose the trans-epoxide (from E-alkene) leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are anti to each other, while the cis-epoxide (from Z-alkene) leads to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are syn.

But wait, the process of ring opening in acid is more about where the attack occurs. Let's imagine the epoxide is a three-membered ring with two substituents on each end. When protonated, the attack occurs from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, maybe for each epoxide, the diol formed has two possible configurations. But if the epoxide is symmetric, both configurations would be the same.

Wait, perhaps in both cases, the diol ends up being the same. No, that doesn't make sense because the starting material is different.

Alternatively, each reaction produces two enantiomers, but since the starting material is enantiomerically pure, perhaps the diol is enantiomerically pure as well.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the products.

Each reaction, Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, would produce a diol. The question is: how many stereoisomers are present in each diol?

If the diol is a meso compound, then it's achiral, so only one peak in the standard HPLC and one peak in the chiral HPLC (since a meso compound would appear as a single peak in a chiral column as well, because it's not chiral).

Wait, but if the diol is a meso compound, then it's a single compound, so it would show as one peak on both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but if the diol is a pair of enantiomers, then in standard HPLC (achiral), they would appear as one peak because the column doesn't distinguish enantiomers. But on a chiral column, they would appear as two peaks.

But in this case, each reaction produces a diol. Let me figure out the structure.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol.

If the diol is a meso compound, then it's a single compound. So, Reaction 1's product would be a single diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol.

If this diol is also a meso compound, then it's a single compound. So, when the chemist combines the products of both reactions, he would have two different diols, each as a single compound.

Wait, but if the two diols are the same, then combining them would just give one compound. But earlier I thought the diols would be the same because the starting materials are symmetric.

Wait, maybe the diol is the same in both cases. Let me think again.

If the diol from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 is the same, then the combined product is just that one diol. But I think that's not correct because the starting alkenes are different.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction gives a different diol. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering that the starting alkenes are E and Z, which are geometric isomers, the diols from each may be different.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a diastereomer of the other. So, combining both products would result in two diastereomers.

But I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the number of stereoisomers each diol would have.

Assuming the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound, then it's a single stereoisomer. The same applies to Reaction 2: if the diol is also a meso compound, then it's a single stereoisomer. So, if the two diols are different, you would have two different meso compounds, each a single stereoisomer. So, when combined, you have two compounds, each appearing as one peak in standard HPLC and as one peak in chiral HPLC.

But wait, perhaps the diols are the same. Let me imagine the structure of the diol.

If the diol from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are the same, then combining them would result in a single compound.

But how can they be the same? Because the epoxide is formed from different starting alkenes.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), but the product diols could be the same if the epoxide is symmetric. Because the diol would have two identical substituents on either end, making it the same regardless.

Wait, perhaps both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 give the same diol because the starting materials are symmetric. So, combining them would give just one diol.

But that would mean that both reactions lead to the same product. I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction gives a different diol. Let's say Reaction 1 gives a diol with a certain configuration, and Reaction 2 gives a diol with a different configuration.

Wait, but in that case, each diol may have multiple stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, making them chiral.

Wait, if the diol is a meso compound, it's not chiral. So, if the diol is a meso compound, it would appear as a single peak on a standard HPLC and a single peak on a chiral HPLC.

If the diol is a pair of enantiomers, then in standard HPLC, they are indistinguishable (one peak), but on a chiral column, they would split into two peaks.

So, assuming each reaction produces a diol that is a meso compound, then each product is a single compound. So, when the products are combined, you have one compound, giving one peak on standard HPLC and one peak on chiral HPLC.

But the problem states that the chemist combines the products of both reactions. So, if each reaction produces a single diol, and they are the same, then the mixture would have just one diol. But if they are different, you would have two diols.

Wait, perhaps the diols are the same. Because the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), but in the case of symmetric alkenes, the diols would be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps each starting material gives a different diol. For example, if the starting material is E, the diol has a certain configuration, and if it's Z, it has another, leading to two diastereomers.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from each reaction is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps we should think about the number of stereocenters.

The diol from each reaction would have two adjacent stereocenters (the two OH groups on adjacent carbons). So, the possible number of stereoisomers depends on whether the molecule is meso or not.

If the diol is a meso compound, then it has two stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. So, it would be a single compound.

If the diol is not meso, then it would have two stereocenters, leading to two enantiomers.

So, for each reaction, whether the diol is meso or not depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide. When the epoxide is opened, is the diol a meso compound?

In the trans-epoxide case, perhaps the attack leads to the hydroxyl groups being on opposite sides, leading to a meso diol.

Similarly, for Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide. When opened, the attack leads to hydroxyl groups on the same side, but if the molecule is symmetric, it would still be a meso compound.

Wait, but in the cis-epoxide, the attack could lead to either a syn or anti addition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from both reactions is a meso compound, same in each case.

If that's the case, then each reaction produces a single diol, which is meso. So, when the products are combined, you have only one product.

But that would mean that the combined mixture has only one compound. So, in standard HPLC, one peak. In chiral HPLC, also one peak.

But looking at the options, that's not one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

B) 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral

C) 2 peaks in both

D) 3 in standard and 4 in chiral

Wait, none of the options say one peak in both. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: Perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to two diastereomers when opened.

Wait, for a trans-epoxide, the ring opening could lead to either the same configuration or opposite, but given the symmetry, perhaps only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a pair of diastereomers.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Each reaction starts with a different alkene (E and Z). Each forms a different epoxide (trans and cis). Each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, leading to a diol.

Assuming that each diol has two stereocenters, and whether they are meso or not.

If the diol from each reaction is a meso compound, then each diol is a single compound. So combining them would give two compounds.

Wait, no. If the two diols are the same, then combining would give one. If different, two.

So, if the diols are different and each is a meso compound, then the combined mixture has two compounds.

In standard HPLC, each would appear as a single peak, so two peaks total.

In chiral HPLC, each meso compound would appear as a single peak because they are not chiral.

So, in the combined mixture, two peaks in both HPLC columns.

Looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

So, I think that might be the correct answer.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, which would mean each reaction produces two enantiomers.

In that case, each diol would have two enantiomers, but since the starting material is enantiomerically pure, each reaction produces a single enantiomer.

Wait, but if the diol is chiral, meaning it has no plane of symmetry, then each reaction would produce a single enantiomer.

Then, combining them, you would have two enantiomers (if the diols are enantiomers of each other) or two diastereomers.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think.

If the diol from Reaction 1 is R,R and the diol from Reaction 2 is S,S, then combining them would give two enantiomers, which on a chiral column would show as two peaks. On a standard HPLC, they would appear as one peak because the column doesn't distinguish enantiomers.

But if the diols are diastereomers, then they would appear as separate peaks on both columns.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but since each reaction produces only one enantiomer, the combined mixture would have two enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral column and one on standard.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me review:

The options are:

A) 4 peaks in both

B) 2 and 3

C) 2 and 2

D) 3 and4.

So, if each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting materials are pure, each reaction produces one enantiomer. So, combining, you have two enantiomers, which would show as one peak on standard and two on chiral.

But that would mean standard HPLC has 1 peak, and chiral has 2. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to four products in total. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, which is a meso compound, leading to two diols in total (if they are different), each appearing as one peak on standard and one on chiral.

So, in the combined mixture, two diols. Each is a meso compound, so in standard HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, each is a single peak, so two peaks.

Which would match option C: 2 peaks in both.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to four products total. But that would require the diol to have multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the overall process.

mCPBA epoxidizes the alkene, and then acid opens the epoxide to form a diol.

Each reaction (E and Z) gives an epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives a diol.

The key is whether these diols are the same or different.

If the starting alkenes are E and Z, but the product diols are the same, perhaps because of symmetry, then combining them would give a single diol.

But if the diols are different, combining would give two diols.

Earlier I thought the diols would be the same, but perhaps they're not.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diol, each being a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, another angle: the initial alkenes are E and Z. The epoxides are trans and cis. When the epoxides are opened in acid, do they form the same diol or different diols?

If the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (anti), resulting in a specific diastereomer. If the epoxide is cis, the diol would have hydroxyl groups on the same side (syn), another diastereomer.

So, the diol from Reaction 1 is anti, and from Reaction 2 is syn. Thus, two different diastereomers.

Each diol would have two stereocenters and would be a pair of enantiomers. So, each reaction gives two enantiomers, but only one enantiomer is formed because the starting material is pure.

Wait, no. If the starting material is pure E, then the epoxide is pure trans, leading to a single diol (a pair of enantiomers, but only one is formed). Similarly, the Z starting material gives a cis epoxide, leading to a different diol (another pair of enantiomers, but only one is formed).

So, the products are two different diols, each a single enantiomer.

When combined, the mixture has two enantiomers (if the diols are enantiomers) or two diastereomers.

Wait, but if the diols are different, they could be diastereomers.

So, the combined mixture has two diastereomers.

In standard HPLC, diastereomers will have different retention times, so two peaks. In chiral HPLC, each diastereomer may be a single peak (if not chiral), or split into enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the diastereomers.

If each diol is a meso compound, then each is a single compound, and combining them would have two meso compounds, each a single peak on both HPLC.

If each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then each reaction produces one enantiomer. So, combining would have two enantiomers, leading to one peak on standard and two on chiral.

But I'm getting stuck.

Another approach: number of stereocenters.

Each diol has two stereocenters. So, each diol could have multiple stereoisomers.

For each reaction:

- Reaction 1: (E) → trans-epoxide → diol with two stereocenters.

If the diol is meso (due to symmetry), then it's a single compound.

- Reaction 2: (Z) → cis-epoxide → diol. If symmetric, also a meso compound.

So, both reactions produce the same meso diol. Thus, the combined mixture is a single diol. So, standard HPLC shows one peak, chiral HPLC also one peak.

But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps this assumption is wrong.

Alternative, perhaps the diols are different.

If the diols are not meso, each would have two stereocenters, leading to two possible stereoisomers for each diol. But if each reaction produces only one stereoisomer, then combining would have two stereoisomers (if they are enantiomers) or two diastereomers.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but the starting material is pure, so each reaction produces only one enantiomer.

So, Reaction 1 produces diol A (enantiomer R,R), Reaction 2 produces diol B (enantiomer S,S). So, combining them gives two enantiomers, which are mirror images.

On a standard HPLC, they would appear as a single peak because the column can't differentiate enantiomers. On a chiral column, they would appear as two separate peaks.

But that would mean standard HPLC has 1 peak, chiral has 2 peaks. But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of diastereomers, but that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: each reaction produces two stereocenters without being meso. So, each diol has two stereocenters, and thus could have four stereoisomers. But that's unlikely unless the molecule isn't symmetric.

But in our case, the starting material is symmetric. So, the diol would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, each reaction gives a meso diol, which is a single compound.

Thus, when combined, you have two meso diols (if they are different), each a single compound. So, two peaks in standard and two in chiral (since they are achiral, each is a single peak).

Which matches option C.

So, the correct answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Thus, the answer is C.

The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in the combined product mixture when analyzed on a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a trans-epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the trans-epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form a diol. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the resulting diol is a meso compound, which is achiral and appears as a single compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a cis-epoxide. Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the cis-epoxide also undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form a diol. Similarly, the symmetry of the starting material ensures that the resulting diol is a meso compound, which is achiral and appears as a single compound.

### Combined Product Mixture:
- The products of both reactions are meso diols. Since the starting alkenes ((E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene) are geometric isomers, the diols formed are different diastereomers. Thus, the combined product mixture contains two distinct meso diols.

### HPLC Analysis:
- **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: Since the two diols are different compounds, they will elute at different retention times, resulting in **2 peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC**: Both diols are meso compounds and are achiral. On a chiral column, achiral compounds appear as single peaks. Therefore, the two diols will also result in **2 peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The combined product mixture will show **2 peaks** on both the standard and chiral HPLC columns.
