Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing two energy terms in a hydrogen atom under a magnetic field. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. Oh right, the magnetic field direction is important because it affects the quantization of angular momentum. The value of B is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong field, but wait, no, wait—1 Tesla is actually a large magnetic field. Because Earth's magnetic field is about 0.5 Gauss, and 1 Tesla is 10,000 Gauss. So that's a strong field, but I'm not sure how that plays into paramagnetic coupling yet.

The problem mentions that m is small. Oh, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is related to the orbital angular momentum. But wait, for electrons, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is given by μ = (eħ/(2m_e)) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, but m can take values from -l to +l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So if m is small, maybe l is small, like l=0 (s orbital) or l=1 (p orbital). But wait, wait, m is small. So perhaps m is much smaller than some other value. Maybe it's compared to other quantum numbers.

The main question is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy term due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external field B. And the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom has a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, right? Because the Balmer-alpha line is about 0.486 μm. So the energy ΔE here is probably the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen that corresponds to that transition.

So I need to compute the ratio of the paramagnetic term to the transition energy and see which is bigger.

First, let's get expressions for both terms.

The paramagnetic energy term, let's call it H', is given by the Zeeman effect. The energy is H' = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for the electron's orbital motion is μ = (eħ/(2m_e)) * m * (l direction). Wait, but for the orbital part, the magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m * (the unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field). Since B is along Oz, the dot product simplifies to μ_orbital * B. So H' = -μ_orbital * B.

Wait, but wait. The orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m. Because for orbital angular momentum L, the magnetic dipole moment is μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L. Since L has components mħ in the z-direction, so μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m. So yeah, H' = - μ_orbital * B_z. Since B is along Oz, B_z is B.

So H' = - (eħ/(2m_e)) * m * B.

But wait, in the hydrogen atom, for the ground state, the orbital quantum number l is 0 (s orbital), so m=0. So the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment would be zero. Hmm, but wait, the problem says m is small, not necessarily zero. So maybe m is 1, like in a p orbital. But wait, the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling or perhaps the spin interaction with the field. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Oh, wait, no. Paramagnetism is due to the electron's spin, not its orbital motion. Because the orbital contribution is diamagnetic, which is much smaller. So wait, I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again.

Oh, right. Paramagnetism arises from the electron's spin magnetic moment, not the orbital. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be due to the spin of the electron. So the spin magnetic moment is μ_spin = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (g_s * s_z), where g_s is the gyromagnetic ratio for spin. For an electron, g_s is approximately 2. So the spin magnetic moment is μ_spin = (eħ)/(2m_e) * 2 * m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2.

Wait, but wait. So the paramagnetic term is H' = -μ_spin · B. Since B is along Oz, this becomes H' = - μ_spin * B. So substituting:

H' = - (eħ/(2m_e)) * 2 * m_s * B.

Simplifying, H' = - (eħ * m_s * B ) / m_e.

Wait, because (eħ/(2m_e)) * 2 = eħ/(m_e), so yeah.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. So ΔE = hc / λ.

Given λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1e-6 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-6 m) = ?

Wait, let me compute that. Let's see:

hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. Because 1240 eV·nm is about 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 1.6e-19 J·eV conversion.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it in Joules.

So hc = 6.626e-34 Js * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 486.1e-6 meters.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 486.1e-6 m = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-4 ≈ 4.086e-22 J.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation:

1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-6 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-4 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-21.

1.9878 / 4.861 is approximately 0.4087.

So ΔE ≈ 0.4087e-21 J ≈ 4.087e-22 J.

But wait, that's the energy per photon. So the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-22 J.

Now, the paramagnetic term H' is the expectation value of the spin Hamiltonian. The spin can be either up or down, so the energy shift would be ± H'. Since the question is about the magnitude, I can just take the absolute value.

H' = (eħ * m_s * B ) / m_e.

But m_s is ±1/2, so |H'| = (e ħ B) / (2 m_e).

Wait, substituting the numbers:

e is the elementary charge, 1.6e-19 C.

ħ is h-bar, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

m_e is electron mass, about 9.109e-31 kg.

B is 1 T.

So plugging in, |H'| = (1.6e-19 C) * (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 T) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: e * ħ * B.

1.6e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 = approximately 1.6 * 1.05 ≈ 1.68, so 1.68e-53.

Multiply by B=1: 1.68e-53.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So |H'| = (1.68e-53) / (1.8218e-30) = (1.68 / 1.8218) * 1e-23 ≈ 0.922 * 1e-23 = 9.22e-24 J.

Wait, that seems really small compared to ΔE which is about 4e-22 J. So H' is about 9e-24 J, and ΔE is about 4e-22 J. So H' is much smaller than ΔE.

So the ratio H'/ΔE is roughly (9e-24)/(4e-22) = (9/4) * 1e-2 ≈ 0.225. So H' is about 22.5% of ΔE. Wait, that's not negligible. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

m_e is 9.109e-31 kg.

So e * ħ = 1.6e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 = let's compute 1.6 * 1.0545718 ≈ 1.6873e-53. So 1.6873e-53.

Multiply by B=1: 1.6873e-53.

Divide by (2 m_e) = 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So 1.6873e-53 / 1.8218e-30 = (1.6873 / 1.8218) )e^(-53 + 30) = (0.926) * 1e-23 = 9.26e-24 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Now, ΔE is about 4e-22 J, and H' is 9e-24 J. So H' is about 2.3% of ΔE. So H' is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question is about the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy ΔE. So if H' is about 2% of ΔE, that's not negligible. But wait, the options are about whether H' is much larger, much smaller, etc.

Wait, the options are: option C says H' << ΔE, which would fit if H' is about 2% of ΔE. So 0.02 is much less than 1, so H' is much smaller than ΔE. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure because the calculation seems to show that H' is about 2% of ΔE, which is not extremely small, but definitely smaller than ΔE. So H' is less than ΔE, but is it much smaller? Well, 2% is not that small, but in the context of atomic physics, perhaps it's considered negligible compared to the transition energy. Or maybe I made a mistake in the value of the spin magnetic moment.

Wait, wait a second. The paramagnetic term for the spin might be different. Let me think again. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = (g_s * eħ)/(2 m_e) * m_s, where g_s is the gyromagnetic ratio for spin, which is approximately 2. So μ_s = (2 * eħ)/(2 m_e) * m_s = (eħ)/(m_e) * m_s.

So H' = - μ_s · B = - (eħ m_s B) / m_e.

Wait, but I had that right earlier. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The transition energy ΔE is probably the energy of the photon emitted during the transition. So that's the energy between two levels. But the paramagnetic term would cause a splitting of the energy levels, perhaps. So the shift due to B is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but let me think about typical values. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the transition from n=2 to n=1 would be about 10.2 eV. Wait, but the given λ is about 0.486 microns, which is the Balmer-alpha line. So n=3 to n=2, which is about 1.89 eV.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I calculated ΔE, I used hc/λ, which gives me the energy in Joules, but perhaps I should compute it in electron volts to compare better.

Let me recompute ΔE in eV.

λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1e-9 m.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 Js, c=3e8 m/s.

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ = 486.1e-9 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.087e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 divided by 4.861e-7 is:

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.4087 * 1e-18 = 4.087e-19 J.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE in eV is 4.087e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, that makes more sense because the Balmer-alpha transition is about 1.89 eV, but perhaps I'm using a more precise value.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, let's compute H' in eV.

H' is (e ħ B m_s) / m_e.

Wait, but wait, earlier calculation gave me H' in J as about 9.22e-24 J.

Convert 9.22e-24 J to eV: 9.22e-24 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 5.75e-5 eV.

So H' is about 5.75e-5 eV.

ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

So H' is 5.75e-5 eV, which is 0.0000575 eV.

Comparing to ΔE: 0.0000575 eV is much smaller than 2.55 eV. So H' is much less than ΔE.

So the ratio is about 2.25e-5. So H' is way smaller than ΔE. So the correct answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

But wait, let me think again. The paramagnetic term H' is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. For a 1 T field, does that shift the energy levels by a significant fraction of the transition energy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because earlier I considered m_s = 1/2, but perhaps for the paramagnetic term, since it's a spin-1/2 particle, the maximum m_s is 1/2.

Wait, but let's double-check the numbers because 5e-5 eV is 0.05 meV, which is really tiny compared to 2.55 eV.

So H' is about 5.75e-5 eV.

ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

So H' is about 2.25e-5 times ΔE. So H' is much less than ΔE, so option C is correct.

But wait, let me think about if I messed up any constants. Let me recalculate H'.

H' = (e * ħ * B * m_s) / (m_e)

Plugging in the numbers:

e = 1.6e-19 C

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

B = 1 T

m_s = 1/2

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

So:

H' = (1.6e-19 C) * (1.05457e-34 J·s) * 1 T * (1/2) / (9.109e-31 kg)

Calculating numerator:

1.6e-19 * 1.05457e-34 = 1.6873e-53.

Multiply by 1/2: 8.4365e-54.

Denominator: 9.109e-31 kg.

So H' = 8.4365e-54 / 9.109e-31 ≈ 9.26e-24 J.

Convert to eV: 9.26e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.78e-5 eV.

So that's correct.

So H' is about 5.78e-5 eV, which is much less than ΔE of about 2.55 eV.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy, so option C is correct: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energy terms.

### 1. **Transition Energy ΔE**
The transition energy is determined using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-6}} = 4.087 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.087 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### 2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy shift is given by:

\[
H' = -\mu_{\text{spin}} \cdot B = -\frac{e \hbar}{2m_e} g_s m_s B,
\]

where:
- \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (elementary charge),
- \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (reduced Planck's constant),
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (electron mass),
- \( g_s = 2 \) (spin gyromagnetic ratio),
- \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) (spin magnetic quantum number),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field strength).

Substituting the values:

\[
H' = \frac{e \hbar B}{2m_e} = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})(1)}{2(9.109 \times 10^{-31})}.
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
e \hbar = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \approx 1.6873 \times 10^{-53}.
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:

\[
H' = \frac{1.6873 \times 10^{-53}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 9.26 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert to electron volts:

\[
H' = \frac{9.26 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### 3. **Comparison of \( \langle H \rangle \) and \( \Delta E \)**
The paramagnetic coupling term \( H' \approx 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). The ratio is:

\[
\frac{H'}{\Delta E} = \frac{5.78 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.26 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, \( \langle H \rangle \) is orders of magnitude smaller than \( \Delta E \).

### 4. **Conclusion**
The correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**

Answer: C
