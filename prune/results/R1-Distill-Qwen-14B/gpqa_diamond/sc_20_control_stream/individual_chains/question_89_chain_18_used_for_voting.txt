Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically leading to an alkene formation. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH should form an alkene, probably 1,3-adamantene because the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Looking at the product 1, the NMR data is given. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but if the product is from elimination of HBr, it should be an alkene. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxides form from peracids. Alternatively, maybe there's a rearrangement or different reaction pathway.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. When KOH is used in elimination, it should form a diene or an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would require some other structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product's NMR. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a triplet from an -OH group or an ether, but wait, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but in that case, the coupling would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so if product 1 is a ketone, that makes sense.

Wait, but how does that happen? Heating with KOH usually leads to elimination. Unless... Oh, wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that elimination isn't possible, so substitution occurs. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ring-strained alkene, but if the product is a ketone, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two opposite positions of the adamantane skeleton. Heating with KOH: perhaps it's a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about elimination. Let me think again. If it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if that's the case, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the elimination leads to a cyclopropane. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed dehydration, forming an alkene, but again, why the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Another possibility is that the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone. How? Maybe via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which could be a ketone. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The adamantane structure is a diamondoid, so each carbon is bonded to three others. When Br is on carbons 1 and 3, perhaps elimination leads to a bridge, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a bridge formation. Maybe when the two Br atoms are removed, the structure forms a bridge, creating a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent Brs are eliminated, the adjacent carbons form a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the reaction conditions again. KOH and heat. Vicinal dihalide with KOH typically gives elimination (E2) to form an alkene. So product 1 should be a diene or an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't from elimination. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH in a substitution would replace Br with OH, giving a diol. So the product would be 1,3-adamantanediol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. How can two Br atoms lead to a ketone? Maybe the base is abstracting a β-hydrogen, and the adjacent Br leaves, leading to a carbocation which could rearrange. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require more than just elimination.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction. Let's think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination, but in a way that forms a ketone. Hmm, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, but that would form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would be a diol, not a ketone.

Another possibility: maybe the two adjacent Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, so when they are eliminated, the ring becomes smaller, creating a carbonyl. For example, perhaps the elimination forms a bridge, which leads to a bicyclic structure with a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about product 1's NMR. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41–2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). 4.79 could be an -OH group, but more likely, perhaps an -OCH2- group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridgehead proton.

Wait, 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H) suggests multiple equivalent protons in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a bridge structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. If so, the carbonyl's adjacent protons would appear around 2.1 ppm. So in product 1, the 1.94 ppm (2H) might be the protons next to the carbonyl. But then where do the other peaks come in?

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial product is an epoxide. The IR would then show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the epoxide, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So that's probably not an epoxide.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to move forward and see if the subsequent steps can shed some light.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I remember that Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. But for Friedel-Crafts, you need an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in some kind of acylation if product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, but product 1 after KOH is a ketone, say, maybe adamantanone. Then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might do something. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, and if the work-up is done with dimethylsulfide (a reductive work-up), it would break the ozonides into carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's piece this together. Product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is used on alkenes. So, considering the previous steps, what could product 2 be?

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2's formation via Al(OiPr)3 suggests an acylation or alkylation. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the first step. Let me think differently. What if the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, resulting in 1,3-diol. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹)? Diols don't have carbonyls. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the reaction is more about the elimination of HBr twice, leading to a ring contraction. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms are on a bridge, eliminating them could lead to a smaller ring with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. But I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH is causing the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, leading to a conjugated diene. Then, after that, perhaps the diene is further reacted. But wait, the product 1's IR suggests a carbonyl, so maybe that's not it.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should proceed to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Let's assume that product 1 is a ketone (since the IR shows a carbonyl). So, heating a ketone with Al(OiPr)3—what reaction would that be? Maybe acylation, but for what? Maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring expansion or another reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed reactions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when heated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some elimination to form a ketone. Maybe two OH groups lose water to form a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a ketone.

Hmm. Another approach: after ozonolysis, product 3's NMR is being analyzed. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would produce carbonyl-containing products. Let's say product 2 is a diene; then ozonolysis would break each double bond.

Wait, but product 2 comes after treatment with Al(OiPr)3. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination.

Wait, let's go back. Product 1: IR shows a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, the initial reaction must form a ketone or another carbonyl-containing compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, leading to a conjugated diene. But that would not directly form a carbonyl. So, maybe after elimination, further oxidation occurs. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. How? Wait, perhaps the reaction is similar to the formation of a diketone via two elimination steps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial structure is a bicyclic compound, and eliminating both Br groups leads to a bridgehead carbonyl. For example, imagine that the two Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, and eliminating them would form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating two HBr molecules leads to a bridge with a carbonyl. So, the product is a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. What would that do? Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is being converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is a diketone, and then it undergoes some kind of cyclization. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or a cyclic ether. But that's not matching the IR data.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Perhaps it's an ether. For example, -O-CH2-.

The 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H) might be from a bridge structure in adamantane. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons in certain positions.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom.

But I'm not seeing it. Maybe I need to think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a diamond shape. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent bridgehead carbons. So, when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to a structure where a bridge is broken, forming a larger ring with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination leads to a double bond. But that would be an alkene, which would have a different IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial reaction is a substitution. Each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an epoxide. But an epoxide would have an IR peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, not 1720.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Hmm, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. Let's assume that. So product 1 is a ketone, maybe 1,3-diketone. Then, product 2 is formed when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe Al(OiPr)3 is acting as a Lewis acid to help in some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. How? Maybe the ketone is undergoing an acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an enol, which then could form an enol ether. But I'm not sure how that would work with Al(OiPr)3.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement, such as a pinacol rearrangement, but that typically requires a diol.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about product 2: if the next step is ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond. So, product 2 is an alkene. How could that happen?

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by a reaction that creates a double bond. Perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes ring-opening or some rearrangement to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and the Al(OiPr)3 is causing an aldol condensation, forming an alkene. That could make sense. So, product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enone).

So, if product 1 is a diketone, heating with Al(OiPr)3 might facilitate an aldol condensation, leading to a conjugated enone (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond would be cleaved. Ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But wait, for ozonolysis, you usually break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, if product 2 is an enone (e.g., R-C=O-CH2-CH2-C=O), ozonolysis would break the central double bond into two carbonyls, giving two ketones.

Wait, but in the problem, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The NMR of product 3 is being considered. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, let's think about product 3. Suppose product 2 is an enone, say, (CH2)2C=CH-CO-R or something similar. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, so product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis of an enone (like a conjugated dienone) can lead to different products. If the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming the ketone is at position 2), ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the enone is part of a cyclic structure. For example, if product 2 is a cyclic enone like cyclohexenone, then ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, but the product after ozonolysis is product 3. Let's say product 3 is a diketone. The NMR would show signals from the carbonyl-adjacent protons. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the carbonyl.

In a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.1–2.5 ppm. The coupling pattern depends on their neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the problem, product 3's NMR is given, but the specific details aren't provided. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those exchanging with solvent).

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to these groups.

Assuming that product 3 is a diketone, the adjacent protons would be split based on neighboring Hs. Let's say each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with each other and any adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbonyl is next to a CH group, which is split by neighboring Hs.

Wait, let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say, 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, say, two aldehydes or ketones.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclopropane with a double bond, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structures. Let's think about the initial reaction again.

Product 1: after KOH, it has a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. So, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or another structure with a double bond.

Wait, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, which can catalyze the formation of enol ethers from ketones. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that might not be directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and heating with Al(OiPr)3 causes ring-opening, forming a double bond. For example, a bridgehead ketone might undergo elimination to form a double bond.

So, product 2 would have a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

So, in product 3, the ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl group would then have adjacent hydrogens. The most deshielded would be the ones next to the carbonyl groups.

If product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone), then ozonolysis would break the central double bond into two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps.

In that case, each CH2 group's protons would couple with each other and any adjacent groups. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the splitting could lead to a triplet or more complex splitting.

Wait, considering a simple case: if the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2-CH2 group. Each CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2. So, each proton in the CH2 would be a quartet, as each is adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2, which in turn are split into triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to another CH2.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure. Suppose product 2 is something like (CH2)2C=CH2. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups: O=C-(CH2)2-O and O=CH2. Wait, no, that's not right. Ozonolysis of an alkene R1R2C=CR3R4 would typically form two carbonyl compounds, such as R1R2CO and R3R4CO.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 2 as a simple diene, like 1,3-butadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. But that's a linear diene.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclopentene, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, let me consider a specific example. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones, perhaps at positions 1 and 3. But I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted double bond, like a trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted alkene.

When ozonolysis is performed on a double bond, each resulting carbonyl group's adjacent protons will have specific coupling patterns. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have protons that are split by neighboring groups.

Let me imagine product 3 as a diketone where each ketone is attached to a CH2 group. Each CH2 would have two protons that are adjacent to the carbonyl. These protons would couple with any neighboring protons.

If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, the coupling would be as follows: each proton in the first CH2 would be split by the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH2 is a group of two equivalent protons. So, each proton in CH2-A is split by the two protons in CH2-B, leading to a triplet.

But in reality, each CH2 group is next to another CH2, so each proton in CH2-A is coupled with two protons from CH2-B. That would make each proton in CH2-A a triplet. Similarly, each proton in CH2-B is a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is (CH2)2(CO)R, then the CH2 groups are adjacent, each with two protons. So, each CH2 group's protons would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons in the neighboring CH2.

But wait, in that case, each CH2 would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded hydrogen (next to CO) would be in a CH2 group, appearing as a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, which would fit.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, such as each CH2 is attached to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: if the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but that's a symmetrical structure. Alternatively, if each CO is attached to a CH group, which in turn is attached to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each carbonyl is next to a CH group. So, each CH would have one proton. That proton would be split by adjacent groups. For example, if each CH is next to a CH2 group, the proton would be split into a triplet (coupled with two protons from CH2). But if the CH is also adjacent to another CH group, it could split further.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, if it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, the proton would be split by neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is next to another CH2 group. So, each CH2 would have two protons, and each proton would couple with the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, that would make the CH2 protons a triplet, as each is coupled with two equivalent protons. So, each of those protons would be a triplet. Hence, the most deshielded hydrogen (as it's adjacent to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Wait, but let me think again. If the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, then each CH2 is adjacent to a CO and to another CH2. Each CH2 would have two protons. Each proton in the first CH2 would see the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the protons in the adjacent CH2 would each be a triplet.

So, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H would be the ones in the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls, appearing as triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH2 is next to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO-R, but that complicates things.

Another scenario: product 3 could have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is a methine (CH) group adjacent to a carbonyl. If this CH is next to two other CH2 groups, the coupling could lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone where each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group which is attached to another CH group, leading to coupling patterns.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding those exchanging). It's probably a triplet or something more complex.

In a typical CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, the splitting would be a triplet for each. So, the most deshielded H (being part of the first CH2) would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is itself next to another CH2, the coupling could lead to a doublet of triplets or another pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, making each CH2 group adjacent to a CO and another CH2. Each CH2's protons would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H would be in the CH2 next to the CO, giving a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, I'm not certain. Another thought: if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which has two protons, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that is split by two different neighboring groups. For example, a CH group next to a CH2 and another CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

Wait, let's think: if a CH has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be as follows. The CH proton would couple with the two protons in each neighboring group. So, each coupling would split the signal into a triplet. But if there are two different couplings, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not sure about the structure. Without knowing exactly what product 3's structure is, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the initial steps again. Let's outline the possible structures:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (carbonyl group, probably a ketone). Structure might be 1,3-diketone.

2. Product 1 → treated with Al(OiPr)3 → product 2, which has a double bond (perhaps via elimination or rearrangement).

3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (diketone or two carbonyl compounds).

In product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O.

Wait, no, more likely, it's a simple diketone like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Wait, but that would be a symmetrical structure, so the CH2 groups would each have two Hs. Each CH2's H would be a triplet, as each is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2.

Thus, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H (from the CH2 next to CO) would be a triplet, option A.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO-O, then the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which could lead to more splitting.

But without the exact structure, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given the options, and considering that the most likely scenario is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, the splitting would be a triplet. So the correct answer is A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. Vicinal dihalides typically undergo elimination (E2 mechanism) to form alkenes. However, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction does not stop at an alkene but proceeds further, likely forming a ketone.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). These signals are consistent with a ketone, where the most deshielded protons are adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or elimination, forming product 2, which contains a double bond. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step targets alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. This forms product 3, which is a diketone or contains carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - If product 3 is a diketone, the structure could resemble a symmetrical compound such as O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO. In this case, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that couple with the two protons in the neighboring CH₂ group. This results in a triplet coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **A) Triplet**: This matches the expected splitting pattern for protons in a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, where each proton is coupled with two equivalent protons.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled with two different sets of non-equivalent protons, which is less likely in this symmetrical diketone structure.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one set of equivalent protons and another set of non-equivalent protons, which is not consistent with the expected structure.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not feasible in this case.

Based on the analysis, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a triplet coupling pattern due to its interaction with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically leading to an alkene formation. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH should form an alkene, probably 1,3-adamantene because the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Looking at the product 1, the NMR data is given. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but if the product is from elimination of HBr, it should be an alkene. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxides form from peracids. Alternatively, maybe there's a rearrangement or different reaction pathway.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. When KOH is used in elimination, it should form a diene or an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would require some other structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product's NMR. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a triplet from an -OH group or an ether, but wait, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but in that case, the coupling would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so if product 1 is a ketone, that makes sense.

Wait, but how does that happen? Heating with KOH usually leads to elimination. Unless... Oh, wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that elimination isn't possible, so substitution occurs. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ring-strained alkene, but if the product is a ketone, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two opposite positions of the adamantane skeleton. Heating with KOH: perhaps it's a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about elimination. Let me think again. If it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if that's the case, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the elimination leads to a cyclopropane. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed dehydration, forming an alkene, but again, why the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Another possibility is that the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone. How? Maybe via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which could be a ketone. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The adamantane structure is a diamondoid, so each carbon is bonded to three others. When Br is on carbons 1 and 3, perhaps elimination leads to a bridge, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a bridge formation. Maybe when the two Br atoms are removed, the structure forms a bridge, creating a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent Brs are eliminated, the adjacent carbons form a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the reaction conditions again. KOH and heat. Vicinal dihalide with KOH typically gives elimination (E2) to form an alkene. So product 1 should be a diene or an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't from elimination. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH in a substitution would replace Br with OH, giving a diol. So the product would be 1,3-adamantanediol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. How can two Br atoms lead to a ketone? Maybe the base is abstracting a β-hydrogen, and the adjacent Br leaves, leading to a carbocation which could rearrange. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require more than just elimination.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction. Let's think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination, but in a way that forms a ketone. Hmm, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, but that would form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would be a diol, not a ketone.

Another possibility: maybe the two adjacent Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, so when they are eliminated, the ring becomes smaller, creating a carbonyl. For example, perhaps the elimination forms a bridge, which leads to a bicyclic structure with a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about product 1's NMR. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41–2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). 4.79 could be an -OH group, but more likely, perhaps an -OCH2- group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridgehead proton.

Wait, 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H) suggests multiple equivalent protons in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a bridge structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. If so, the carbonyl's adjacent protons would appear around 2.1 ppm. So in product 1, the 1.94 ppm (2H) might be the protons next to the carbonyl. But then where do the other peaks come in?

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial product is an epoxide. The IR would then show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the epoxide, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So that's probably not an epoxide.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to move forward and see if the subsequent steps can shed some light.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I remember that Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. But for Friedel-Crafts, you need an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in some kind of acylation if product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, but product 1 after KOH is a ketone, say, maybe adamantanone. Then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might do something. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, and if the work-up is done with dimethylsulfide (a reductive work-up), it would break the ozonides into carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, let's piece this together. Product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is used on alkenes. So, considering the previous steps, what could product 2 be?

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2's formation via Al(OiPr)3 suggests an acylation or alkylation. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the first step. Let me think differently. What if the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, resulting in 1,3-diol. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹)? Diols don't have carbonyls. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the reaction is more about the elimination of HBr twice, leading to a ring contraction. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms are on a bridge, eliminating them could lead to a smaller ring with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. But I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH is causing the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, leading to a conjugated diene. Then, after that, perhaps the diene is further reacted. But wait, the product 1's IR suggests a carbonyl, so maybe that's not it.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should proceed to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Let's assume that product 1 is a ketone (since the IR shows a carbonyl). So, heating a ketone with Al(OiPr)3—what reaction would that be? Maybe acylation, but for what? Maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring expansion or another reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed reactions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when heated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some elimination to form a ketone. Maybe two OH groups lose water to form a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a ketone.

Hmm. Another approach: after ozonolysis, product 3's NMR is being analyzed. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would produce carbonyl-containing products. Let's say product 2 is a diene; then ozonolysis would break each double bond.

Wait, but product 2 comes after treatment with Al(OiPr)3. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination.

Wait, let's go back. Product 1: IR shows a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, the initial reaction must form a ketone or another carbonyl-containing compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, leading to a conjugated diene. But that would not directly form a carbonyl. So, maybe after elimination, further oxidation occurs. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. How? Wait, perhaps the reaction is similar to the formation of a diketone via two elimination steps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial structure is a bicyclic compound, and eliminating both Br groups leads to a bridgehead carbonyl. For example, imagine that the two Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, and eliminating them would form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating two HBr molecules leads to a bridge with a carbonyl. So, the product is a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. What would that do? Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is being converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is a diketone, and then it undergoes some kind of cyclization. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or a cyclic ether. But that's not matching the IR data.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Perhaps it's an ether. For example, -O-CH2-.

The 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H) might be from a bridge structure in adamantane. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons in certain positions.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom.

But I'm not seeing it. Maybe I need to think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a diamond shape. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent bridgehead carbons. So, when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to a structure where a bridge is broken, forming a larger ring with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination leads to a double bond. But that would be an alkene, which would have a different IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial reaction is a substitution. Each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an epoxide. But an epoxide would have an IR peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, not 1720.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Hmm, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. Let's assume that. So product 1 is a ketone, maybe 1,3-diketone. Then, product 2 is formed when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe Al(OiPr)3 is acting as a Lewis acid to help in some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. How? Maybe the ketone is undergoing an acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an enol, which then could form an enol ether. But I'm not sure how that would work with Al(OiPr)3.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement, such as a pinacol rearrangement, but that typically requires a diol.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about product 2: if the next step is ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond. So, product 2 is an alkene. How could that happen?

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by a reaction that creates a double bond. Perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes ring-opening or some rearrangement to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and the Al(OiPr)3 is causing an aldol condensation, forming an alkene. That could make sense. So, product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enone).

So, if product 1 is a diketone, heating with Al(OiPr)3 might facilitate an aldol condensation, leading to a conjugated enone (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond would be cleaved. Ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But wait, for ozonolysis, you usually break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, if product 2 is an enone (e.g., R-C=O-CH2-CH2-C=O), ozonolysis would break the central double bond into two carbonyls, giving two ketones.

Wait, but in the problem, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The NMR of product 3 is being considered. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, let's think about product 3. Suppose product 2 is an enone, say, (CH2)2C=CH-CO-R or something similar. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, so product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis of an enone (like a conjugated dienone) can lead to different products. If the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming the ketone is at position 2), ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the enone is part of a cyclic structure. For example, if product 2 is a cyclic enone like cyclohexenone, then ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, but the product after ozonolysis is product 3. Let's say product 3 is a diketone. The NMR would show signals from the carbonyl-adjacent protons. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the carbonyl.

In a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.1–2.5 ppm. The coupling pattern depends on their neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the problem, product 3's NMR is given, but the specific details aren't provided. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those exchanging with solvent).

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to these groups.

Assuming that product 3 is a diketone, the adjacent protons would be split based on neighboring Hs. Let's say each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with each other and any adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbonyl is next to a CH group, which is split by neighboring Hs.

Wait, let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say, 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, say, two aldehydes or ketones.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclopropane with a double bond, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structures. Let's think about the initial reaction again.

Product 1: after KOH, it has a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. So, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or another structure with a double bond.

Wait, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, which can catalyze the formation of enol ethers from ketones. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that might not be directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and heating with Al(OiPr)3 causes ring-opening, forming a double bond. For example, a bridgehead ketone might undergo elimination to form a double bond.

So, product 2 would have a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

So, in product 3, the ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl group would then have adjacent hydrogens. The most deshielded would be the ones next to the carbonyl groups.

If product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone), then ozonolysis would break the central double bond into two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps.

In that case, each CH2 group's protons would couple with each other and any adjacent groups. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the splitting could lead to a triplet or more complex splitting.

Wait, considering a simple case: if the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2-CH2 group. Each CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2. So, each proton in the CH2 would be a quartet, as each is adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2, which in turn are split into triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to another CH2.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure. Suppose product 2 is something like (CH2)2C=CH2. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups: O=C-(CH2)2-O and O=CH2. Wait, no, that's not right. Ozonolysis of an alkene R1R2C=CR3R4 would typically form two carbonyl compounds, such as R1R2CO and R3R4CO.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 2 as a simple diene, like 1,3-butadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. But that's a linear diene.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclopentene, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, let me consider a specific example. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones, perhaps at positions 1 and 3. But I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted double bond, like a trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted alkene.

When ozonolysis is performed on a double bond, each resulting carbonyl group's adjacent protons will have specific coupling patterns. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have protons that are split by neighboring groups.

Let me imagine product 3 as a diketone where each ketone is attached to a CH2 group. Each CH2 would have two protons that are adjacent to the carbonyl. These protons would couple with any neighboring protons.

If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, the coupling would be as follows: each proton in the first CH2 would be split by the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH2 is a group of two equivalent protons. So, each proton in CH2-A is split by the two protons in CH2-B, leading to a triplet.

But in reality, each CH2 group is next to another CH2, so each proton in CH2-A is coupled with two protons from CH2-B. That would make each proton in CH2-A a triplet. Similarly, each proton in CH2-B is a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is (CH2)2(CO)R, then the CH2 groups are adjacent, each with two protons. So, each CH2 group's protons would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons in the neighboring CH2.

But wait, in that case, each CH2 would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded hydrogen (next to CO) would be in a CH2 group, appearing as a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, which would fit.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, such as each CH2 is attached to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: if the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but that's a symmetrical structure. Alternatively, if each CO is attached to a CH group, which in turn is attached to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each carbonyl is next to a CH group. So, each CH would have one proton. That proton would be split by adjacent groups. For example, if each CH is next to a CH2 group, the proton would be split into a triplet (coupled with two protons from CH2). But if the CH is also adjacent to another CH group, it could split further.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, if it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, the proton would be split by neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is next to another CH2 group. So, each CH2 would have two protons, and each proton would couple with the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, that would make the CH2 protons a triplet, as each is coupled with two equivalent protons. So, each of those protons would be a triplet. Hence, the most deshielded hydrogen (as it's adjacent to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Wait, but let me think again. If the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, then each CH2 is adjacent to a CO and to another CH2. Each CH2 would have two protons. Each proton in the first CH2 would see the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the protons in the adjacent CH2 would each be a triplet.

So, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H would be the ones in the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls, appearing as triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH2 is next to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO-R, but that complicates things.

Another scenario: product 3 could have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is a methine (CH) group adjacent to a carbonyl. If this CH is next to two other CH2 groups, the coupling could lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone where each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group which is attached to another CH group, leading to coupling patterns.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding those exchanging). It's probably a triplet or something more complex.

In a typical CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, the splitting would be a triplet for each. So, the most deshielded H (being part of the first CH2) would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is itself next to another CH2, the coupling could lead to a doublet of triplets or another pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, making each CH2 group adjacent to a CO and another CH2. Each CH2's protons would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H would be in the CH2 next to the CO, giving a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, I'm not certain. Another thought: if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which has two protons, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that is split by two different neighboring groups. For example, a CH group next to a CH2 and another CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

Wait, let's think: if a CH has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be as follows. The CH proton would couple with the two protons in each neighboring group. So, each coupling would split the signal into a triplet. But if there are two different couplings, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not sure about the structure. Without knowing exactly what product 3's structure is, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the initial steps again. Let's outline the possible structures:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (carbonyl group, probably a ketone). Structure might be 1,3-diketone.

2. Product 1 → treated with Al(OiPr)3 → product 2, which has a double bond (perhaps via elimination or rearrangement).

3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (diketone or two carbonyl compounds).

In product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O.

Wait, no, more likely, it's a simple diketone like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Wait, but that would be a symmetrical structure, so the CH2 groups would each have two Hs. Each CH2's H would be a triplet, as each is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2.

Thus, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H (from the CH2 next to CO) would be a triplet, option A.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO-O, then the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which could lead to more splitting.

But without the exact structure, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given the options, and considering that the most likely scenario is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, the splitting would be a triplet. So the correct answer is A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. Vicinal dihalides typically undergo elimination (E2 mechanism) to form alkenes. However, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction does not stop at an alkene but proceeds further, likely forming a ketone.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). These signals are consistent with a ketone, where the most deshielded protons are adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or elimination, forming product 2, which contains a double bond. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step targets alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. This forms product 3, which is a diketone or contains carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - If product 3 is a diketone, the structure could resemble a symmetrical compound such as O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO. In this case, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that couple with the two protons in the neighboring CH₂ group. This results in a triplet coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **A) Triplet**: This matches the expected splitting pattern for protons in a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, where each proton is coupled with two equivalent protons.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled with two different sets of non-equivalent protons, which is less likely in this symmetrical diketone structure.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one set of equivalent protons and another set of non-equivalent protons, which is not consistent with the expected structure.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not feasible in this case.

Based on the analysis, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a triplet coupling pattern due to its interaction with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group.

**Answer: A**
