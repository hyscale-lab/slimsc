Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are all different combinations of multiples of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). So, each particle's energy levels are quantized based on their quantum number n, right?

Wait, but these are four identical fermions. Oh right, because they're spin-1/2 particles, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin.

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number n. The formula I remember is E_n = (n² E), where E is as given. So each particle's energy is proportional to the square of its quantum number.

Since the particles are fermions, they must have unique quantum states. Each state is determined by (n, spin), but wait, in 1D, the quantum state is just n, and spin is either up or down. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So, let's think about how to fill the states. The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration where each particle is in the lowest possible states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Let's start filling the states:

The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles (spin up and down).
The second level (n=2) can hold another 2 particles.
But wait, we have four particles. So, n=1 and n=2 can each hold 2, making a total of 4. So all four particles can be in n=1 and n=2 with each having spin up and down.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Then, the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, wait. No. Each level's energy is n² E. So, the energy for each particle in n=1 is 1² E = E. Similarly, n=2 is 4 E.

So for four particles: two in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). The total ground state energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10 E. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Wait, that's the total for the ground state. But wait, in the question, it's asking for the energies of each state (ground, first excited, second excited), but I think it's the total energy of each state. Or is it the energy of each particle? No, I think it's the total energy of the system.

Wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So for each state, what's the total energy.

So in the ground state, two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2*1² + 2*2²) E = (2 + 8) E = 10 E. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E. That doesn't match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because perhaps each particle is in a different state, but in 1D, with spin, each n can have two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (spin up and down), the next two go into n=2 (again spin up and down). So the total energy is (2 * 1² + 2 * 2²) E = (2 + 8) E = 10 E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, what's the first option? Let me check the options again.

Option A: 30E,39E,50E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option C:4E,10E,15E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, in my calculation, the ground state is 10E. So which options have 10E as the ground state? Options B, C, D. So which one is correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the filling. Let me think again. Since all four particles are spin-1/2, and the well is 1D, so each n can hold two particles (spin up and down).

So the first two go into n=1, then next two into n=2. So each particle in n=1 has energy E, each in n=2 has 4E. So the total is 2*1 + 2*4 = 10 E.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

Now, what about the first excited state? Excited states mean that the particles are promoted to higher energy levels. But since they're fermions, the next available state would be n=3, but wait, maybe not.

Wait, but in the ground state, two are in n=1 and two in n=2. To get the first excited state, perhaps we promote one of the n=2 particles to n=3? Or maybe fill a state with higher energy.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps the first excited state would have the lowest possible energy higher than the ground state. So perhaps the configuration would have three particles in the lowest possible states and one in the next. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense. Let me think again.

Wait, because the ground state has the two lowest levels filled. So to get the first excited state, perhaps we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, each level can hold two, so if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but let me count the number of particles.

If in the first excited state, perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, that's four particles. Let me compute the energy.

n=1: 2 particles → 2*E = 2E.

n=2: 1 particle → 4E.

n=3: 1 particle → 9E.

Total: 2E +4E +9E = 15 E.

Wait, so the first excited state would have energy 15E? But wait, no, because in the configuration, the two particles in n=2. So maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted. Hmm, maybe I should think about all possible ways to have four particles in the lowest possible energies, but with some in higher states.

Wait, perhaps the next state after 10E is when three particles are in the first two levels, and one is promoted to the next. Wait, but wait, the first two levels can hold four particles (n=1 and n=2, each with two). So the ground state is those four filled.

If that's the case, then the first excited state would involve moving a particle to a higher level. But since all lower states are filled, the next available is n=3. So we would have... perhaps three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? No, wait, because n=1 can hold two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. So ground state is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2. So all four are in the lowest possible states.

To get the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, but since n=3 can hold two, but we have only four particles, so moving one up would leave one in n=2 and one in n=3.

So configuration would be: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

So energy would be:

2 * 1² E + 1 * 2² E + 1 * 3² E = 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

So first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but what about the second excited state? Let's see.

The next possible state would involve moving another particle up. Let's see:

We have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → total 4.

Alternatively, perhaps another configuration is possible with one particle in n=2 and two in n=3.

Wait, no, because n=3 can hold two particles, so if we have two in n=3, and two in n=1, that's possible.

So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.

Wait, but in that case, the energy is 2*1² E + 2*3² E = 2E + 18E = 20E.

But wait, another possibility is having one particle in n=2 and two in n=3, and one in n=4? Let me calculate.

Wait, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 0 elsewhere. That's four particles.

Wait, to get the next excited state, perhaps the next is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So total energy would be 2*1 + 2*9= 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, another configuration could be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3.

Wait, another possibility is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Let's calculate the energy: 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 +8 +9 =18E. Hmm, that's lower than 20E.

Wait, but in terms of energy, 18E is lower than 20E. But 18E is higher than 15E. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E.

Wait, but let me think about the possible states. The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Let me list all possible configurations with four particles and compute their energies.

Option 1: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 10E. (ground state)

Option 2: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 2 +4 +9 =15E. (first excited)

Option 3: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. (second?)

Option 4: 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 8 + 18=26E. (higher)

Option 5: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 →1 +8 +9=18E.

So that's 18E.

So the energies in order would be 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 26E, etc.

So the first excited is 15E, the second excited is 18E.

Wait, but in the options, option D says the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E. So that looks right.

But wait, earlier I thought the first excited state was 15E and the second is 18E, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first is 15E, second is 18E.

But let me think again about the possible excited states. Because sometimes the ordering might be different based on which configuration is lower.

Wait, in the configuration with 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3: the energy is 1 + 8 +9 =18E.

Another configuration could be 0 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 2 in n=3: but that would require 4 particles. So 0 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → energy 0 + 8 + 18=26E.

Wait, but earlier configuration of 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 is 15E, and 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 is 20E.

So the order is:

10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited?), 20E, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration with 3 particles in n=2 and 1 in n=4, but that's higher.

Wait, but wait, n=2 can hold two particles, so having three would violate the Pauli principle. So that's not possible.

So the next possible higher energy states after 15E are 18E, then 20E, etc.

So the second excited state would be 18E, making option D the correct one.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

So the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is the next possible energy, which is 15E.

The second excited state would be the next higher energy, which is 18E.

So the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E.

Looking at the options, option D is 10,15,18. So that's the answer.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would require more energy.

Wait, no, because that would have more energy than 15E.

Wait, no, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, which would require taking one particle from n=2 (which has two) to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So the total energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2 +4 +9=15E.

Then the next would be promoting another particle to n=3: so 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2 +0 + 18 =20 E. But 20 is higher than 18E.

Wait, but another configuration is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So 1 +8 +9=18E. So that's lower than 20E.

So the order is 10E (ground), then 15E (first excited), then 18E (second excited), then 20E (third excited), etc.

So the given options are:

D: 10,15,18 → which matches.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the following principles:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**: The energy levels are quantized and given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. This means each \( n \) can hold at most two particles.

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   - The two lowest energy levels, \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \), can each hold two particles.  
   - Total energy of the ground state:  
     \[
     E_{\text{ground}} = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 2 \cdot (2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
     \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   - To achieve the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).  
   - Configuration: 2 particles in \( n=1 \), 1 particle in \( n=2 \), and 1 particle in \( n=3 \).  
   - Total energy of the first excited state:  
     \[
     E_{\text{first excited}} = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 1 \cdot (2^2 E) + 1 \cdot (3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
     \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   - To achieve the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) or \( n=3 \) to \( n=4 \).  
   - However, a lower energy configuration is achieved by having 1 particle in \( n=1 \), 2 particles in \( n=2 \), and 1 particle in \( n=3 \).  
   - Total energy of the second excited state:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 1 \cdot (1^2 E) + 2 \cdot (2^2 E) + 1 \cdot (3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
     \]

6. **Energy Ordering**:  
   - Ground state: \( 10E \)  
   - First excited state: \( 15E \)  
   - Second excited state: \( 18E \)

From the given options, the correct sequence of energies is \( 10E, 15E, 18E \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are all different combinations of multiples of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). So, each particle's energy levels are quantized based on their quantum number n, right?

Wait, but these are four identical fermions. Oh right, because they're spin-1/2 particles, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin.

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number n. The formula I remember is E_n = (n² E), where E is as given. So each particle's energy is proportional to the square of its quantum number.

Since the particles are fermions, they must have unique quantum states. Each state is determined by (n, spin), but wait, in 1D, the quantum state is just n, and spin is either up or down. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So, let's think about how to fill the states. The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration where each particle is in the lowest possible states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Let's start filling the states:

The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles (spin up and down).
The second level (n=2) can hold another 2 particles.
But wait, we have four particles. So, n=1 and n=2 can each hold 2, making a total of 4. So all four particles can be in n=1 and n=2 with each having spin up and down.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Then, the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, wait. No. Each level's energy is n² E. So, the energy for each particle in n=1 is 1² E = E. Similarly, n=2 is 4 E.

So for four particles: two in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). The total ground state energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10 E. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Wait, that's the total for the ground state. But wait, in the question, it's asking for the energies of each state (ground, first excited, second excited), but I think it's the total energy of each state. Or is it the energy of each particle? No, I think it's the total energy of the system.

Wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So for each state, what's the total energy.

So in the ground state, two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2*1² + 2*2²) E = (2 + 8) E = 10 E. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E. That doesn't match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because perhaps each particle is in a different state, but in 1D, with spin, each n can have two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (spin up and down), the next two go into n=2 (again spin up and down). So the total energy is (2 * 1² + 2 * 2²) E = (2 + 8) E = 10 E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, what's the first option? Let me check the options again.

Option A: 30E,39E,50E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option C:4E,10E,15E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, in my calculation, the ground state is 10E. So which options have 10E as the ground state? Options B, C, D. So which one is correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the filling. Let me think again. Since all four particles are spin-1/2, and the well is 1D, so each n can hold two particles (spin up and down).

So the first two go into n=1, then next two into n=2. So each particle in n=1 has energy E, each in n=2 has 4E. So the total is 2*1 + 2*4 = 10 E.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

Now, what about the first excited state? Excited states mean that the particles are promoted to higher energy levels. But since they're fermions, the next available state would be n=3, but wait, maybe not.

Wait, but in the ground state, two are in n=1 and two in n=2. To get the first excited state, perhaps we promote one of the n=2 particles to n=3? Or maybe fill a state with higher energy.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps the first excited state would have the lowest possible energy higher than the ground state. So perhaps the configuration would have three particles in the lowest possible states and one in the next. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense. Let me think again.

Wait, because the ground state has the two lowest levels filled. So to get the first excited state, perhaps we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, each level can hold two, so if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but let me count the number of particles.

If in the first excited state, perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, that's four particles. Let me compute the energy.

n=1: 2 particles → 2*E = 2E.

n=2: 1 particle → 4E.

n=3: 1 particle → 9E.

Total: 2E +4E +9E = 15 E.

Wait, so the first excited state would have energy 15E? But wait, no, because in the configuration, the two particles in n=2. So maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted. Hmm, maybe I should think about all possible ways to have four particles in the lowest possible energies, but with some in higher states.

Wait, perhaps the next state after 10E is when three particles are in the first two levels, and one is promoted to the next. Wait, but wait, the first two levels can hold four particles (n=1 and n=2, each with two). So the ground state is those four filled.

If that's the case, then the first excited state would involve moving a particle to a higher level. But since all lower states are filled, the next available is n=3. So we would have... perhaps three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? No, wait, because n=1 can hold two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. So ground state is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2. So all four are in the lowest possible states.

To get the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, but since n=3 can hold two, but we have only four particles, so moving one up would leave one in n=2 and one in n=3.

So configuration would be: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

So energy would be:

2 * 1² E + 1 * 2² E + 1 * 3² E = 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

So first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but what about the second excited state? Let's see.

The next possible state would involve moving another particle up. Let's see:

We have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → total 4.

Alternatively, perhaps another configuration is possible with one particle in n=2 and two in n=3.

Wait, no, because n=3 can hold two particles, so if we have two in n=3, and two in n=1, that's possible.

So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.

Wait, but in that case, the energy is 2*1² E + 2*3² E = 2E + 18E = 20E.

But wait, another possibility is having one particle in n=2 and two in n=3, and one in n=4? Let me calculate.

Wait, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 0 elsewhere. That's four particles.

Wait, to get the next excited state, perhaps the next is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So total energy would be 2*1 + 2*9= 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, another configuration could be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3.

Wait, another possibility is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Let's calculate the energy: 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 +8 +9 =18E. Hmm, that's lower than 20E.

Wait, but in terms of energy, 18E is lower than 20E. But 18E is higher than 15E. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E.

Wait, but let me think about the possible states. The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Let me list all possible configurations with four particles and compute their energies.

Option 1: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 10E. (ground state)

Option 2: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 2 +4 +9 =15E. (first excited)

Option 3: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. (second?)

Option 4: 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 8 + 18=26E. (higher)

Option 5: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 →1 +8 +9=18E.

So that's 18E.

So the energies in order would be 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 26E, etc.

So the first excited is 15E, the second excited is 18E.

Wait, but in the options, option D says the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E. So that looks right.

But wait, earlier I thought the first excited state was 15E and the second is 18E, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first is 15E, second is 18E.

But let me think again about the possible excited states. Because sometimes the ordering might be different based on which configuration is lower.

Wait, in the configuration with 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3: the energy is 1 + 8 +9 =18E.

Another configuration could be 0 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 2 in n=3: but that would require 4 particles. So 0 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → energy 0 + 8 + 18=26E.

Wait, but earlier configuration of 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 is 15E, and 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 is 20E.

So the order is:

10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited?), 20E, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration with 3 particles in n=2 and 1 in n=4, but that's higher.

Wait, but wait, n=2 can hold two particles, so having three would violate the Pauli principle. So that's not possible.

So the next possible higher energy states after 15E are 18E, then 20E, etc.

So the second excited state would be 18E, making option D the correct one.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

So the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is the next possible energy, which is 15E.

The second excited state would be the next higher energy, which is 18E.

So the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E.

Looking at the options, option D is 10,15,18. So that's the answer.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would require more energy.

Wait, no, because that would have more energy than 15E.

Wait, no, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, which would require taking one particle from n=2 (which has two) to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So the total energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2 +4 +9=15E.

Then the next would be promoting another particle to n=3: so 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2 +0 + 18 =20 E. But 20 is higher than 18E.

Wait, but another configuration is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So 1 +8 +9=18E. So that's lower than 20E.

So the order is 10E (ground), then 15E (first excited), then 18E (second excited), then 20E (third excited), etc.

So the given options are:

D: 10,15,18 → which matches.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the following principles:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**: The energy levels are quantized and given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. This means each \( n \) can hold at most two particles.

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   - The two lowest energy levels, \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \), can each hold two particles.  
   - Total energy of the ground state:  
     \[
     E_{\text{ground}} = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 2 \cdot (2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
     \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   - To achieve the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).  
   - Configuration: 2 particles in \( n=1 \), 1 particle in \( n=2 \), and 1 particle in \( n=3 \).  
   - Total energy of the first excited state:  
     \[
     E_{\text{first excited}} = 2 \cdot (1^2 E) + 1 \cdot (2^2 E) + 1 \cdot (3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
     \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   - To achieve the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) or \( n=3 \) to \( n=4 \).  
   - However, a lower energy configuration is achieved by having 1 particle in \( n=1 \), 2 particles in \( n=2 \), and 1 particle in \( n=3 \).  
   - Total energy of the second excited state:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 1 \cdot (1^2 E) + 2 \cdot (2^2 E) + 1 \cdot (3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
     \]

6. **Energy Ordering**:  
   - Ground state: \( 10E \)  
   - First excited state: \( 15E \)  
   - Second excited state: \( 18E \)

From the given options, the correct sequence of energies is \( 10E, 15E, 18E \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
