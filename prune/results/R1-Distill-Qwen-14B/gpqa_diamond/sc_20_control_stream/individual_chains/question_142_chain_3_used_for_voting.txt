Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states have density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but this one looks like a mixture of |0> and |1> states.

Wait, so ρ is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. The |0><0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (1,1) and 0s elsewhere. So adding them together, each diagonal element becomes 1, and then we multiply by 1/2. So the density matrix is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But wait, how do you represent a mixed state geometrically?

Wait, the density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So for a density matrix ρ, the corresponding Bloch vector r can be found by solving I + r·σ = 2ρ.

Let me compute this. Here, ρ is (1/2) (|0><0| + |1><1|). So 2ρ is |0><0| + |1><1|. Let's compute each component:

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

So if I have I + r·σ = 2ρ. Let me compute 2ρ. 2ρ is [[1,0], [0,1]], which is the same as I. So I + r·σ = I. Which implies that r·σ must be zero matrix.

Because I + r·σ = I → r·σ = 0. So each component must satisfy:

r_x * σx + r_y * σy + r_z * σz = 0 matrix.

Looking at each element:

The (0,0) element of r·σ is r_z * σz(0,0) → r_z * 1. The (0,1) element is r_x * 1 (from σx) + r_y*(-i) (from σy). Similarly, the (1,0) is r_x *1 + r_y*(i), and (1,1) is r_z * (-1).

So setting each element to zero:

For (0,0): r_z * 1 =0 → r_z = 0.

For (0,1): r_x - i r_y =0 → r_x = i r_y.

For (1,0): r_x + i r_y =0 → r_x = -i r_y.

Wait, how can both (0,1) and (1,0) be zero? Let me see.

From (0,1): r_x - i r_y =0 → r_x = i r_y.

From (1,0): r_x + i r_y =0 → r_x = -i r_y.

So substituting r_x from (0,1) into (1,0): i r_y = -i r_y → i r_y + i r_y =0 → 2i r_y=0 → r_y=0.

Then from r_x =i * r_y → r_x=0.

So all components r_x, r_y, r_z are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Wait, but that makes sense because the state is maximally mixed, so it's the completely depolarized state, which should be at the center of the Bloch sphere. So in terms of the qubit space, this density matrix is at the origin. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is related to the density matrix \( \rho \) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Solving for \( \mathbf{r} \), we equate \( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 2\rho \). Substituting \( 2\rho = I \), we find:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that \( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), and \( r_z = 0 \), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely depolarized state, which is consistent with the maximally mixed state. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( (0, 0, 0) \).
