Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1=1 and l2=1. The problem mentions ignoring spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part here.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait, coupled state... So the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1. But wait, how do you get l from two l=1 particles? I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the possible total l values are from l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So 1 + 1 = 2, and |1-1|=0, so possible l's are 2,1,0. Oh but in this state, l is 2. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both electrons. Each of these operators corresponds to the z-component of the individual angular momenta. We're supposed to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, L1z and L2z are separate operators. So the state we're in is a coupled state, which is a combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta.

Let me think about the basis for this state. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total angular momentum is 2, and the m value is -1. But to find the probability of getting specific values for L1z and L2z, I probably need to expand this coupled state into the individual product states.

Wait, the total angular momentum state |l, m> is a combination of the product states |l1, m1>|l2, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m. So in this case, m is -1.

So for each possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1, the coupled state is a linear combination of these product states. The coefficients would be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about measuring L1z and L2z, which are the individual z-components. So each L_z operator for each particle acts only on their respective parts of the tensor product state.

So, if the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>, perhaps it's a combination of states where each electron has certain m1 and m2 values, such that m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1 for each. So when you combine two of them, the possible m_total values are from 2 down to -2, in steps of 1. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum over m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1. Each term in the sum will be |m1>|m2> multiplied by the appropriate coefficient.

Wait, but the state is |l=2, m=-1>, which is the total state. So to expand it into the product basis, we can use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The general expansion for |l1, l2, l, m> is a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m of [ < l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m > ] |l1 m1> |l2 m2>.

In this case, l1=l2=1, l=2, m=-1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are all pairs where m1 + m2 = -1. Since each m can be -1, 0, +1, the possible pairs are:

m1=-1, m2=0 → m=-1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → m=-1.

Wait, can m1 be any other value? Let's see: possible m1 values are -1, 0, +1. So m1 + m2 must be -1.

If m1 is -1, then m2 is 0.

If m1 is 0, then m2 is -1.

If m1 is +1, m2 would have to be -2, but m2 cannot be less than -1. So the only possible pairs are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

Wait, wait, no. Because m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So if m1 is 1, m2 would have to be -2, which is impossible. So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). Are there any others? Let's see:

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → yes.

m1 = 0 → m2 = -1.

m1 = 1 → m2 = -2 → not possible.

So only two terms contribute to the expansion.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as:

[ a |m1=-1> |m2=0> + b |m1=0> |m2=-1> ].

What are the coefficients a and b? These are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l1=1 and l2=1 to get l=2, m=-1.

Hmm, I think I need to remember how the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work for combining two p orbitals (l=1). The state |l=2, m=-1> is formed from which combination?

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l1 and l2 to get L^2 and M. For l=2, m=-1, the state is a combination of states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each l and m can be found in standard tables or from the properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the general expansion.

The general expansion for |2, m> in terms of |m1, m2> is as follows.

For m=2: only m1=1, m2=1 → coefficient is 1.

For m=1: m1=1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=1. The coefficients would involve sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the specific m=-1 case.

Wait, for m=-1, the possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). So the state is a linear combination of these two.

The standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 to get l=2 are:

I think the coefficients are:

For |2, m> where m= -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

The expansion for |2, -1> would be:

sqrt( (something) ) * |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( (something else) ) * |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, I think the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). Or perhaps their squares add to 1.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about how the states are built.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the explicit expansion.

The coupled state |l=2, m=-1> can be written as:

sqrt( 2/3 ) |m1=-1, m2=0> - sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two p orbitals (l=1) to get l=2.

The state |2, 1> is constructed from |1,1>|0,0> and |1,0>|1,1>, but wait, that might not be correct. Wait, perhaps I should remember that the coefficients are such that the sum of squares equals 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the ladder operators. The ladder operator for L+ would raise the state.

But maybe another approach: the state |2, -1> is an eigenstate of L^2 and L_z, with eigenvalues 2(2+1)ħ² and -ħ respectively.

But the basis states are |m1, m2>, which are eigenstates of L1z and L2z. So to find the expansion, perhaps I can think about the possible combinations.

Wait, but perhaps the coefficients are such that the state |2, -1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, with certain coefficients.

I think the correct coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). Wait, let me try to write it as:

|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about the signs and the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the general approach, even without knowing the exact coefficients.

So the coupled state is a linear combination of two product states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So when we write the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a superposition of these two product states with certain coefficients.

The probability of each product state would be the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.

So, in the expansion,

|1,1,2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Then, the probability of finding m1=-1 and m2=0 is |a|^2, and m1=0 and m2=-1 is |b|^2.

If I can find |a|² and |b|², I can find the probabilities.

But the question is about measuring L1z and L2z, each being -ħ.

Wait, L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum. Since l1=1, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. The eigenvalues are m1 * ħ.

So, to get L1z = -ħ, m1 must be -1. Similarly, L2z = -ħ implies m2 = -1.

But in the expansion of the coupled state, the possible product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, so in neither of these product states do both m1 and m2 equal -1. Because in the first term, m1=-1, m2=0; in the second term, m1=0, m2=-1.

So the joint probability of finding m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero because that product state doesn't appear in the expansion.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Are there other terms in the expansion?

Earlier, I thought that only the two product states contribute to the m=-1 case, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, let's think about the possible m1 and m2 that add up to m=-1.

So m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs:

(-1, 0), (0, -1).

Is there any other possible pair? Well, m1 and m2 can't be beyond their allowed ranges. So for example, if m1=1, m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed because m2 can't be less than -1 for l=1.

So, only those two terms are present.

Thus, the coupled state doesn't include any term where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero.

Wait, but wait a minute. If both electrons have m=-1, their sum would be m_total = -2, right? But our coupled state has m_total = -1, so that's not compatible. So any product state where both have m=-1 would contribute to a coupled state with m=-2, not m=-1.

So the two-electron state |1,1,2,-1> does not have any component where both electrons have m=-1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the answer should be option D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total angular momentum projection quantum number.

To determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), we need to analyze the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). This state is a linear combination of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the magnetic quantum numbers of the first and second electrons, respectively. The condition \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) must be satisfied for the total \( m = -1 \).

The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are:
1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

Thus, the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) can be written as:
\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = a |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + b |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The joint probability of measuring specific \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) values is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficient.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \). This corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) does not include the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), as this would require \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which is incompatible with the total \( m = -1 \) in the coupled state.

Therefore, the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

If m1 is -1, then m2 is 0.

If m1 is 0, then m2 is -1.

If m1 is +1, m2 would have to be -2, but m2 cannot be less than -1. So the only possible pairs are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

Wait, wait, no. Because m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So if m1 is 1, m2 would have to be -2, which is impossible. So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). Are there any others? Let's see:

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → yes.

m1 = 0 → m2 = -1.

So the answer should be option D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total angular momentum projection quantum number.

To determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), we need to analyze the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). This state is a linear combination of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the magnetic quantum numbers of the first and second electrons, respectively. The condition \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) must be satisfied for the total \( m = -1 \).

The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are:
1. \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)
2. \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)

Thus, the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) can be written as:
\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = a |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + b |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The joint probability of measuring specific \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) values is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficient.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \). This corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) does not include the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), as this would require \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which is incompatible with the total \( m = -1 \) in the coupled state.

Therefore, the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

Answer: D
