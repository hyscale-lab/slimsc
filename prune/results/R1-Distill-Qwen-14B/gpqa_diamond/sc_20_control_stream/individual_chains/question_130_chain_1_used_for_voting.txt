Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, alright. So, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is an emission line in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. But since the question is about absorption, these clouds are absorbing that wavelength from the quasar's light. 

Redshift, z, tells us how much the wavelength has stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I think is the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). 

So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. But wait, wait. I think I might be mixing something up. The Lyman alpha emission line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. If the cloud is at some redshift, then the observed wavelength would be longer than that. 

Wait, but the question is about the clouds absorbing the quasar's light. Oh, right, quasars emit a lot of light, including the Lyman alpha wavelength. So when this light passes through the hydrogen cloud, the cloud's hydrogen absorbs at the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. So from our perspective, the wavelength we observe is the quasar's emitted wavelength (which is 1216 Angstroms in its own frame) shifted by the cloud's redshift.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The quasar emits light with a certain wavelength. The Lyman alpha line is in the quasar's frame. Then when the light passes through the hydrogen cloud, which is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), the cloud absorbs at its own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. So the observed wavelength is the quasar's emitted wavelength (which is at 1216 Angstroms) shifted by the cloud's redshift plus any other effects. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to model this.

The quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms in its own rest frame. This light travels through space, and then passes through a hydrogen cloud that is moving away from us. The hydrogen in the cloud will absorb at its rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms as well. But because the cloud is moving away, the wavelength of the quasar's Lyman alpha photon as seen by the cloud is actually redshifted. So the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. But since the cloud's hydrogen is at rest in the cloud's frame, it will absorb at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. Therefore, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must be 1216 Angstroms for the absorption to occur.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the cloud is moving away, the photon's wavelength is longer than the rest frame. So in the cloud's frame, the photon's wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But wait, the cloud's hydrogen is at rest, so it will absorb just the photon that has wavelength 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, no, that would imply that the photon's wavelength is 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. But since the photon's wavelength in the quasar's frame is 1216*(1 + z_quasar), and the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is (1216)*(1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud), because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, then for the photon to be absorbed by the cloud, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must match the cloud's rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms.

So:

Photon's wavelength in quasar frame: lambda_q = 1216 Angstroms (because the quasar emits at Lyman alpha)
Photon's wavelength in cloud frame: lambda_c = lambda_q * (1 + z_cloud) / (1 + z_quasar) ?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up with the direction. Let me think more carefully. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, right? Because the cloud is along the line of sight to the quasar. So when the photon leaves the quasar, it's at wavelength 1216*(1 + z_quasar). Then, as it travels through the cloud, the cloud has a redshift z_cloud. So from the cloud's frame, the photon's wavelength is lambda_c = lambda_q_observed / (1 + z_cloud). Or perhaps lambda_c = lambda_q_observed * (1 + z_cloud)?

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of observed frame (us on Earth) and the quasar's frame.

The quasar's Lyman alpha is emitted at wavelength 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. So when it travels to us, if the quasar is at redshift z_quasar, the observed wavelength is lambda_q = 1216 * (1 + z_quasar).

Now, the hydrogen cloud is somewhere between us and the quasar. Let's say the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So, from the cloud's perspective, the quasar's light is redshifted by (1 + z_cloud). Wait, no. The cloud's frame is moving away from the quasar. So the photon's wavelength from the quasar, as seen by the cloud, is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) / (1 + z_quasar) ?

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me think about the general formula for redshift between two objects. If Object A is at redshift z_A, and Object B is at redshift z_B (with z_B > z_A), then the redshift between them is z = (1 + z_B)/(1 + z_A) - 1.

Wait, no. The way redshift works is that if you have two objects, the redshift from A to B is given by 1 + z_AB = (1 + z_B)/(1 + z_A). So the photon emitted by A is observed by B at a wavelength corresponding to z_AB.

But in our case, the photon is emitted by the quasar (z_quasar), passes through the cloud at z_cloud, and then reaches us. So, the photon's wavelength when it leaves the quasar is 1216*(1 + z_quasar). Then, when it reaches the cloud, which is at z_cloud (and z_cloud < z_quasar), the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is lambda_cloud = lambda_quasar_obs * (1 + z_cloud) ?

Wait, no. Because the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So, from the cloud's perspective, the quasar is at a higher redshift. The photon's wavelength when it arrives at the cloud is (1216 * (1 + z_quasar)) / (1 + z_cloud), because the photon has been redshifted due to the expansion between the quasar and the cloud.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to write this out step by step.

Suppose the quasar is at a very high redshift, z_q, and the hydrogen cloud is at a lower redshift, z_c. The quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame.

When this photon travels towards us, it will be redshifted by the expansion of the universe between the quasar and us. But before that, it passes through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud is at a certain redshift, so when the photon arrives at the cloud, it's already been redshifted by the expansion from the quasar to the cloud. 

So, the wavelength of the photon when it reaches the cloud is 1216 * (1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift between the quasar and the cloud. But z_quasar_cloud is ( (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) - 1.

Wait, I think I'm getting it. Alternatively, the photon's wavelength when it arrives at the cloud is 1216 * (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud). 

But the cloud's hydrogen will absorb this photon if the photon's wavelength in the cloud's rest frame is equal to 1216 Angstroms. So, in the cloud's frame, the photon's wavelength is lambda_cloud = lambda_quasar_obs_in_cloud.

Wait, but the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is lambda_quasar_in_cloud = (1216 * (1 + z_quasar)) / (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, no. The photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is lambda_cloud = lambda_quasar_obs (in our frame) / (1 + z_cloud). Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so from the cloud's perspective, our frame is redshifted by z_cloud. So, our observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_cloud * (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the frame transformations. Let me think about it this way.

In the cloud's rest frame, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is redshifted. So, the cloud sees the quasar's Lyman alpha photon as having a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms because the quasar is at a higher redshift.

The cloud's hydrogen can only absorb at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's own frame. So, in the cloud's frame, the quasar's Lyman alpha photon must be exactly 1216 Angstroms for the cloud to absorb it. So, the wavelength of the photon as seen by the cloud must be 1216 Angstroms.

But the quasar's photon has a rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. So, in the quasar's frame, the photon is emitted at 1216. But the cloud is moving away from the quasar due to the expansion of the universe, so the photon's wavelength is stretched by the factor (1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift between the quasar and the cloud.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach.

The condition for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha photon is that, in the cloud's rest frame, the photon's wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. So, the photon's wavelength in the quasar's frame is 1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud), since the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar.

Wait, no, the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, so the redshift between them is (z_quasar - z_cloud)/(1 + z_cloud) ?

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the quasar's Lyman alpha photon as observed in the cloud's frame. For the cloud to absorb it, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must be 1216 Angstroms.

So, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is lambda_cloud = lambda_quasar_emit * (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud). Wait, no. Because the photon leaves the quasar, which is at z_quasar, and then travels to the cloud. The expansion between the quasar and the cloud is such that the photon's wavelength is stretched by the factor (1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift between the quasar and the cloud.

Wait, the redshift between two points with z1 and z2 (z2 > z1) is given by (1 + z2) = (1 + z1) * (1 + z_relative). So, z_relative = ( (1 + z2)/(1 + z1) ) - 1.

In our case, the quasar is at z_q, the cloud at z_c, and z_q > z_c. So, the redshift between the quasar and the cloud is z_rel = ( (1 + z_q) / (1 + z_c) ) - 1. So, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is lambda_quasar_emit * (1 + z_rel) = 1216 * ( (1 + z_q)/(1 + z_c) ) .

But for the cloud to absorb it, lambda_quasar_cloud_frame must be 1216 Angstroms. So,

1216 * ( (1 + z_q) / (1 + z_c) ) = 1216.

Divide both sides by 1216:

(1 + z_q) / (1 + z_c) ) = 1 → 1 + z_q = 1 + z_c → z_q = z_c.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would mean the quasar and the cloud are at the same redshift, but the cloud is along the line of sight, so the cloud must be at a lower redshift than the quasar. That's a contradiction.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, so z_c < z_q.

In that case, the photon emitted by the quasar at 1216 Angstroms would have a wavelength in the cloud's frame of 1216 * (1 + z_rel), where z_rel is the redshift between the quasar and the cloud.

But for the cloud to absorb it, this must be equal to 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So,

1216 * (1 + z_rel) = 1216 → 1 + z_rel = 1 → z_rel = 0.

Which implies that the quasar and the cloud are at the same redshift. But that's impossible because the cloud is in front of the quasar.

This suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I should think of it from the observer's perspective.

The quasar's Lyman alpha photon is observed by us at some wavelength. The hydrogen cloud, which lies between us and the quasar, absorbs light at a wavelength that depends on its own redshift.

Wait, but the cloud's own Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. So, from our perspective, the absorption occurs at a wavelength of 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). But the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is observed by us at 1216 * (1 + z_quasar).

So, for the absorption to occur, the quasar's Lyman alpha photon, as observed by us, must coincide with the absorption wavelength of the cloud. That is,

1216 * (1 + z_quasar) = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud).

Which again implies z_quasar = z_cloud. But that's impossible because the cloud is in front of the quasar. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. The quasar's Lyman alpha is in the UV, but when it's redshifted, it might move into the optical range for us. The cloud's absorption line would be at a different wavelength.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the quasar's Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, but when it passes through the hydrogen cloud, the cloud absorbs it at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's rest frame. So, the quasar's photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must be 1216 Angstroms.

So, if the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame is 1216 Angstroms, then in our frame, the wavelength is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud), because the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud relative to us.

But the photon was emitted by the quasar at 1216 Angstroms, and after traveling through the expansion of the universe, it's now at 1216 * (1 + z_quasar) Angstroms when it reaches us. But wait, the photon passes through the cloud on its way to us. So, the photon's wavelength when it leaves the quasar is 1216, then it gets redshifted as it travels through the universe, but how much does it get redshifted before reaching the cloud?

Alternatively, let me think about this: the photon is emitted by the quasar at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud is at a certain redshift, so when the photon arrives at the cloud, its wavelength is 1216 * (1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift between the quasar and the cloud.

But for the cloud to absorb it, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must be 1216 Angstroms. So,

1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud) = 1216 → z_quasar_cloud = 0.

Which again suggests that the quasar and cloud are at the same redshift, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think in terms of observed wavelengths.

The quasar's Lyman alpha emission is observed by us at lambda_q = 1216*(1 + z_q).

The hydrogen cloud is at a redshift z_c. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at lambda_c = 1216*(1 + z_c).

For the absorption to occur, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission must be at the same wavelength as the cloud's absorption. So,

lambda_q = lambda_c.

So,

1216*(1 + z_q) = 1216*(1 + z_c).

Which again implies z_q = z_c. But that's impossible because the cloud is between us and the quasar, so z_c < z_q.

Hmm, this is confusing. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question says that the clouds of neutral hydrogen are absorbing the light from the background quasars. So the quasar is behind the cloud. So, the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar.

Wait, but then how can the cloud's absorption line match the quasar's emission line? Because the quasar's Lyman alpha is at a higher redshift, so the observed wavelength would be longer than the cloud's absorption line.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_q), and the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_c). So, in our observed frame, the quasar's emission is at a longer wavelength than the cloud's absorption. So, if the quasar's emission line is at a longer wavelength, how does the cloud's absorption line affect it?

Wait, no. The emission line is from the quasar, which is at a higher redshift. The absorption line is from the cloud, which is at a lower redshift. So, the absorption would occur at a wavelength shorter than the quasar's emission.

Wait, but how does that affect the detection? Because the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is in the UV, but if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorption could shift into the optical.

Wait, but the question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. So, the absorption feature must be in the optical range for us to observe it with such telescopes.

So, the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. We need this to be in the optical range, which for ground-based telescopes is roughly 400-700 nm, or 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be less than about 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, wait, but 1216 Angstroms is in the ultraviolet. If we have z_cloud such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical, then:

1 + z_cloud = 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.756.

So z_cloud ≈ 4.756.

But that's higher than any of the options provided. The options are up to 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction. Let's think again.

If the cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman alpha absorption is observed at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms.

We want this to be in the optical range so that ground-based telescopes can see it.

The optical range is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms).

So, 4000 < 1216*(1 + z) < 7000.

Let me compute the lower and upper limits.

Lower limit: 1216*(1 + z) > 4000 → 1 + z > 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292 → z > 2.292.

Upper limit: 1216*(1 + z) <7000 → 1 + z < 7000 /1216 ≈5.756 → z <4.756.

So, for the absorption to be in the optical, the redshift z should be between approximately 2.29 and 4.75.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that the clouds can be detected. So, the minimum z is about 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above this. Option D is 1.9, which is below 2.29, so that would place the absorption line in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks UV.

Wait, but wait. The Lyman alpha absorption from the cloud would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). If this is in the optical (so z_cloud is about 2.3 or higher), then the absorption is in the visible spectrum and can be observed. If z_cloud is lower than 2.29, the absorption would be in the UV, which can't be observed from the ground.

So, the lower limit on z_cloud is approximately 2.29. The closest option is C) 2.4.

Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So, the lower limit is around 2.29, so the minimum redshift is option C) 2.4.

Wait, but why isn't option A (z=3) the lower limit? Because 3 is higher than 2.29.

Wait, I think I need to double-check my calculations.

Let me compute 1216*(1 + z) = 4000.

z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.292) -1 = 2.292.

So, any z higher than 2.292 would bring the absorption into the optical. So, the minimum z is around 2.29.

So, the lower limit is the smallest z such that 1216*(1+z) is just above 4000 Angstroms. That's z ~ 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest lower limit is 2.4, which is option C.

Wait, but the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects". So the redshift must be at least 2.29, so the lower limit is z=2.29. So, any z above that is acceptable.

So, the possible redshifts are from z=2.29 to higher. The question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z is ~2.29. So, any option where z >=2.29 is acceptable.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is above 2.29. Option A is 3, which is also acceptable.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit, so the smallest possible z that still allows detection. So, the lower limit is z=2.29, so the minimal z is approximately 2.3. So, the options given are A)3 and C)2.4. So, the lower limit is 2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, and the cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstroms. But wait, the quasar's emission is observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar), and the absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But for the absorption to be visible, the absorption wavelength must be in the optical. So, for z_cloud, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

So, solving for z_cloud:

(4000 < 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <7000)

1 + z_cloud > 4000 /1216 ≈3.292 → z_cloud >2.292

Similarly, 1 + z_cloud <7000/1216≈5.756 → z_cloud <4.756.

So, the redshift z_cloud must be between approximately 2.29 and 4.75.

So, the lower limit is around 2.29. So, any redshift above that will allow the absorption to be in optical. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So, the minimal z is 2.29. So, the correct answer is the smallest option above 2.29, which is option C) 2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

The Lyman alpha absorption line occurs at a rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms in the hydrogen cloud's rest frame. For the absorption to be detectable in the optical range (approximately 4000–7000 Angstroms), the observed wavelength of the absorption line must fall within this range. The observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \times (1 + z)
\]

where \( z \) is the redshift of the hydrogen cloud. To ensure the absorption line is in the optical range, we set up the following inequalities:

\[
4000 < 1216 \times (1 + z) < 7000
\]

### Step 1: Solve for the lower limit of \( z \)
The lower limit corresponds to the absorption line being at the shortest wavelength in the optical range (4000 Angstroms):

\[
1216 \times (1 + z) > 4000
\]

\[
1 + z > \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.292
\]

\[
z > 3.292 - 1 \approx 2.292
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \).

### Step 2: Solve for the upper limit of \( z \)
The upper limit corresponds to the absorption line being at the longest wavelength in the optical range (7000 Angstroms):

\[
1216 \times (1 + z) < 7000
\]

\[
1 + z < \frac{7000}{1216} \approx 5.756
\]

\[
z < 5.756 - 1 \approx 4.756
\]

Thus, the upper limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 4.76 \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. From the calculation, the lower limit is \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is acceptable but not the smallest possible value.
- **B) 1.2**: This is below the calculated lower limit and would place the absorption line in the ultraviolet, which cannot be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is just above the calculated lower limit and satisfies the condition for detection in the optical range.
- **D) 1.9**: This is below the calculated lower limit and would also place the absorption line in the ultraviolet.

### Conclusion
The smallest redshift that allows the Lyman alpha absorption to be detected in the optical range is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the options, the closest value is **C) 2.4**.

Answer: C
