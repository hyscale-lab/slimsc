Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read through it again and understand what's going on.

The question is about gene interactions and disease resistance in white lupine. We've got three genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants for each, and some double mutants. The idea is that at least one of these is a transcription factor upstream of others. The resistance levels are given for each mutant and their combinations.

So the data shows:

- g1 (mutant for G1): 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10% (so even worse than either alone)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So gene B is epistatic to gene A if the phenotype of A depends on B. Also, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here these genes are about disease resistance, so maybe not relevant unless the genes affect multiple aspects.

Wait, but the question asks about the interaction between these genes. Since G2 knockout has 0% resistance, that suggests that G2 is crucial for resistance. Because without G2, the plants can't resist the disease at all.

Looking at the double mutants, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. Same as when G2 is knocked out alone. That might suggest that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is not working, then even if G1 is present, it doesn't matter because G2's function is needed for G1's effect. Or wait, maybe G2 is the transcription factor upstream of G1. Let's think about how that would work.

If G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate the expression of other genes, like G1 and/or G3. So, if G2 is non-functional (g2), then those downstream genes (G1 and G3) wouldn't be expressed or active. So, in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, which could be because without G2, none of the downstream genes are working.

Looking at the other mutants: g1 is at 75%, which is better than g2 but worse than wild type. So G1 contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. G3 is at 50%, which is worse than wild type, so it's also contributing.

Now, the double mutants: when G1 and G2 are both knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is 0%. But wait, in g2 alone, it's already 0%, so what's the effect of knocking out G1 in addition? If G1 is downstream of G2, then in g2, G1 isn't functioning anyway. So knocking out G1 in g2 would have the same effect, which it does (0%). So that suggests G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g1g3 has resistance 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). That implies that when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance in a redundant way—like if one is working, there's enough resistance, but when both are gone, it's worse. So redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate for the other. But in this case, when both are out, the resistance drops further, so maybe they are additive but not redundant? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another way: in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than both g1 (75) and g3 (50). This suggests that the two genes contribute to resistance in a way that they don't fully compensate for each other. So if you have only G1, resistance is 75, which is not as good as wild type. If you have only G3, it's 50. So when both are missing, it's worse than either alone. So maybe they're in the same pathway, but not necessarily redundant.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates both G1 and G3. Let me model it.

If G2 is a TF (transcription factor), it turns on G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g2, both are off, so no resistance.

In g1, G2 is still working, so G3 is on. Hence, g1 has 75% resistance. But without G1, perhaps the resistance depends on G3? And if G3 is active, the resistance is lower than when both are active.

Wait, but in g1, G3 is active because G2 is working. So if G3 alone gives 50% resistance, but when G1 is also present, they add up to 100% (wild type). Hmm, but g1 is 75%—so that's not matching. Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but have additive effects. So when both are present, their combined effect is 100%, but individually, they contribute 75% and 50% respectively. But that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, and G3 is also downstream of G2.

Wait, the data for g1 is 75% resistance. So without G1, the resistance is 75%—which is better than g3's 50% but worse than wild type. So perhaps G1 is involved in a more minor pathway or maybe G1 is working in parallel to G3.

Wait, another approach: epistatic relationships. Let's look at the double mutants.

In the g1g2 double mutant, resistance is 0%. But since g2 is 0% alone, this suggests that G1's effect depends on G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the absence of G2, G1 can't function. So G2 is upstream.

Similarly, in the g2g3 double mutant, resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So G3's effect is also dependent on G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So G2 is the transcription factor because it's the one that's upstream.

Now, looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is 10%. That's lower than either g1 (75) or g3 (50). So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps their combined knockout makes things worse. But how?

Wait, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, and they are additive, then knocking out both would reduce the resistance further. So maybe G1 contributes 75% - 50% = 25% of the resistance, and G3 contributes 50% - 25% = 25%? Not sure, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So if G2 is the upstream TF activating both, then in the wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, both are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. When only G1 is knocked out, G3 is active, leading to 50% (since G3 alone gives 50%?), but wait the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. Let me make a table.

Wild type: 100% (so all genes are functional).

g1: 75% → missing G1. So if G1 contributes 25% to the resistance. Because without it, resistance is 75%—so G1 normally adds 25% on top of others.

Wait no, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps G1 is part of a redundant system. Let's think about gene redundancy. If two genes are redundant, they can compensate for each other. So, in a double mutant, the phenotype would be worse than each single mutant.

But in this case, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant. Because if they were redundant, the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double mutant. But here, the double mutant is worse than both singles. So that suggests they are additive, perhaps.

Wait, but the other double mutants: g1g2 is 0%, which is same as g2. So that's consistent with G2 being upstream of G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0% same as g2. So G2 is upstream of G3 as well.

So, the key point is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Now, the question is about which option is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. But from the data, G2 is epistatic to G1, as in the absence of G2 (g2), G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1. But the option says G1 is a TF, which I don't think is correct because the data suggests G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Same promoter? Maybe that's not the right model. Also, does G3 epistatic to G1? From the data, when G1 and G3 are both out, the resistance is worse than either. So perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3? Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But here, the question is about resistance. I'm not sure if that's the case. Also, in option C, G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. But how? Let me think. If g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, that suggests that in the absence of both, the effect is worse. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and both contribute to resistance. If G1 is upstream of G3, then G1 would be epistatic to G3. Because the function of G3 depends on G1.

Wait, but in the case where G1 is upstream, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function regardless of its own status. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is non-functional because G1 is upstream. But wait, in the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is higher than g1g3's 10%. So that can't be right. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, then in g1, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so g1 should have the same as g1g3. But g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%, and higher than g1g3's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is upstream of G1. If G3 is upstream, then in g3, G1 is not functional. But g3 has 50% resistance, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that also doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think again. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's function masks G3's. So in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 would be seen. So in the g1g3 double mutant, you'd see the effect of G3. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using epistatic relationships. Let's think about what each double mutant shows.

In g1g2, resistance is 0%. Since g2 is 0%, that's the same. So G1's effect is only present when G2 is active. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

So G2 is the main gene; without it, everything else doesn't matter.

Now, the only other double mutant with non-zero is g1g3 at 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than when either is knocked out.

So in the presence of G2, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So when G1 is out, G3 is still present, giving 50% resistance. When G3 is out, G1 is present, giving 75% resistance. But when both are out, the resistance is 10%.

So G1 and G3 are contributing in a way that their combined absence is worse than either alone. That suggests that they work in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the effect of the double mutant wouldn't be worse than the single mutants. For example, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then knocking out both would only be as bad as the worse single mutant. But here, it's worse than both, which suggests they are additive.

So, the model is: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive (75 +50 = 125, but that's more than 100, so perhaps the wild type is 100, so G1 alone gives 75, G3 alone gives 50, but together, it's 100. But the data for g1 and g3 don't fit that model as in, when G1 is out, the resistance is 75, which would be G3 alone. So without G1, G3 is active, giving 50%? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active, giving 100% resistance. In g1, G3 is active, giving 50%, but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the presence of G1 or G3 is sufficient for some level of resistance. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined activity adds up. So when G1 and G3 are both present, the resistance is 100%; when G1 is out, resistance is 50% (because G3 is active), but the data says g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So when G1 is out, the resistance drops to 75%, which is worse than wild type. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. G3 contributes 50%, but when both are out, it drops to 10%. Wait that doesn't make sense. Maybe G1 contributes 25 (100 -75) and G3 contributes 50, but when both are out, 100 -25 -50 =25, but the data is 10%, which is less than 25.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic toward G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that if either G1 or G3 is present, the same function is done. So if you knock out G1, G3 can compensate, and vice versa. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So if they were redundant, their single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double mutant. But here, the double mutant is 10% compared to 75 and 50. So that doesn't fit; redundancy would require that the double mutant is as bad as the worse single mutant. So that can't be right. So option D is likely incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But in this scenario, it's about resistance. I'm not sure about that part. The epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, the effect would be determined by G1. But the data says g1g3 is worse than g1 (75) and worse than g3 (50). So that doesn't fit the model. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic toward G1. Same promoter would imply they are co-regulated. But I don't see how that would directly explain the data. Also, G3 being epistatic to G1 would mean that in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. But in the data, when G3 is out (g3), G1 is present and resistance is 75%. If G3 were epistatic, then in g3, G1's effect wouldn't matter. But resistance is 50% in g3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should model each option's scenario.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3. So, G1's function is upstream of G3. So in the absence of G1 (g1), G3 can't function. But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which would imply that in the absence of G3, G1 is functional. Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then G3's function depends on G1. So in g1, G3 should not be functional. But if g3 alone is 50%, that suggests that in the presence of G1 (i.e., wild type), G3 contributes 50% to resistance. So in that case, g1 (where G3 is functional) would have 50% + something from G1?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% resistance.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of the double mutant would depend on G1. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than either, so that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as g3. But the data isn't matching that either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this in terms of how much each gene contributes.

Assuming G2 is the TF, it's required for the activation of G1 and G3.

In the wild type, all three are functional, so resistance is 100%.

In g1: G2 is okay, so G3 is active. G1 is not active. Resistance is 75%. So perhaps G1 contributes 25% to resistance. G3 contributes 75%? Because 75% (g1) = 100% - 25% (G1's contribution).

In g3: G2 is okay, so G1 is active. G3 is not. Resistance is 50%. So G3 contributes 50%, because 100% - 50% =50% (g3's resistance).

Wait, that would mean G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So when both are knocked out (g1g3), the total would be 100% -25% -50% =25%, but data shows 10% resistance. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps they are not additive.

Alternatively, maybe the two genes are part of the same pathway. So their combined knockout would not just subtract but have a more severe effect. Maybe they function in a linear pathway, and only the last step matters.

Wait, for example, let's say G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So in g1, G3 isn't activated, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%. That doesn't fit. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, g1 would have the same as g1g3 (since G3 wouldn't be active). But g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which is different.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Another approach: Let's construct a model.

G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance.

So:

Wild type: G2 → G1 active, G2 → G3 active → resistance 100%.

g1: G2 → G3 active → resistance 50% (but the data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute in a way that their combined activity is additive, but each has a base level of activity without the other. So, when both are present, it's 100%, when only G1 is present, it's 75%, when only G3 is present, it's 50%, and when neither is present, it's 25% (but the data for g1g3 is 10%). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is required for G1 and G3, which in turn are required for a step in the disease resistance pathway. So, without G2, you can't activate G1 and G3, so no resistance (g2 is 0%). G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So when G1 is out, G3 is active, leading to 50% resistance (g1 is 75%? No, that doesn't fit.)

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, I think G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. If they have same promoter, then knocking out G1 would also knock out G3, but in the data, g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%. So they aren't the same. Therefore, option B is unlikely.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But in this scenario, it's about just resistance. I'm not sure about that. But perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to other traits, but that's not relevant here. The key is the epistatic relationship.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that would mean that in the absence of G1, G3's function is worse than when G1 is present. So perhaps G1 is required for G3's function. So G3's effect is downstream of G1.

Wait, but in that case, knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from being functional. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that would mean that G3 is only partially functional in the absence of G1, which contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the absence of G3, G1's effect doesn't matter. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which would mean that in the absence of G3, G1 is functional. So that would fit if G3's function is downstream of G1. Then, in the absence of G3, G1 can't function, so resistance would be lower. But the data shows g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50% and worse than wild type.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a pathway.

If G2 → G1 → G3.

So G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. Then:

- Wild type: G3 is active, resistance 100%.

- g2: G1 and G3 inactive → resistance 0%.

- g1: G3 inactive → resistance 0%, but data shows 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 → G1 and G2 → G3. Both G1 and G3 independently contribute to resistance. So in g1, G3 is active, giving 50% (but data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates G1, which also activates another gene (let's call it G4) that's involved in resistance. But this is getting too speculative.

Maybe it's time to make a decision based on the data and the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. Unlikely, since G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. Unlikely because their single mutants have different resistances.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3. I'm not sure about the pleiotropy, but the epistatic part: G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the absence of G1, G3's effect isn't seen. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is worse than wild type but better than g1g3's 10%. So maybe G3 contributes 50% when G1 is present, but in the absence of G1, G3 can't contribute, leading to 10%? That doesn't fit the data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. Redundancy would mean that knocking out both would have the same effect as the worse single mutant. But data shows 10%, which is worse than either. So D is incorrect.

So perhaps option A is incorrect because G2 is the TF, not G1.

Looking back, option C says G2 is TF. So considering that, which is correct.

Another angle: the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 function in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a severe defect. But why would the single mutants not be as bad?

Wait, maybe G1 is required for G3's function. So in the absence of G1, G3 can't function, so resistance would drop. But in the data, g3 has 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is required for G1's function. In g3, G1 can't function, leading to 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 have partial functions. For instance, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, but together they contribute 75%. Then, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 25% (100 -75 =25%). But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is less than 25%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway requires both G1 and G3. So, if either is missing, the resistance is lower, but if both are missing, it's the worst. So, perhaps the pathway is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance. So, each contributes to the pathway, but both are needed for maximum resistance. So in the single mutants, you lose some resistance, and in the double, you lose all. But that doesn't fit the numbers.

Wait, another model: G2 activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute a part to the resistance. In the wild type, both are present, giving full resistance (100%). If G1 is knocked out, G3 provides 50% resistance (so g1 is 75%? No, data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So, in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are off. In the absence of G1, G3 is off. So g1 would have 0% resistance. But data says g1 is 75%, so that's not matching.

Wait, maybe G2 activates G1, which can function on its own, and G2 also activates G3, which can also function on its own. So, in the absence of G2, both are off. In the absence of G1, G3 is active, giving 50%. In the absence of G3, G1 is active, giving 75%. When both are absent, resistance is 0%. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about epistasis.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So, if gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the presence of a certain allele in gene B determines whether the phenotype of gene A is expressed.

In our case, the presence of G2 determines whether G1 and G3 can function. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That's clear because without G2, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3.

Now, among G1 and G3, their combined effect in the double mutant is worse than either single. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways, and each contributes to resistance.

So, the model is:

- G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in parallel pathways.

So, when G1 is knocked out, G3 still contributes 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G1 contributes more than G3. So if G1 is out, resistance drops by 25% (from 100 to 75). G3 is out, drops by 50% (from 100 to 50). When both are out, drops by an additional 25 (from 75 to 50?), but the data shows 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, in the wild type, G1 and G3 together contribute 100. If G1 is out, G3 contributes 50. If G3 is out, G1 contributes 75. If both are out, resistance is 25. But the data shows 10% in g1g3. So perhaps the model is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes to the activity of a downstream gene. So, the more upstream genes you knock out, the worse the resistance.

But I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should look for which option correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and the fact that G1 and G3 are not redundant, but their combined absence causes more severe resistance.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

I'm not sure about the pleiotropy. But since G2 is the TF, that part is correct. The interaction between G1 and G3 in the double mutant would suggest that G1 is epistatic to G3 if G1's function is upstream. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1 if G3's function is upstream.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. Which is worse than either single mutant. So, perhaps the functions of G1 and G3 are additive but not independent. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is more than just the sum. But I'm not sure how that applies to epistasis.

Another thought: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. So in g3, G1 is present, so G3's effect is seen. But in g1g3, since G1 is absent, G3's absence doesn't matter. But the data shows g1g3 is worse than g3, which suggests that G3 contributes more when G1 is absent. So maybe it's the opposite: G3 is epistatic to G1.

But I'm getting stuck and time is limited. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive. So, the only option that matches this is option A or C. But I'm not sure about the pleiotropy part.

Wait, the question says the three candidate genes are of unknown function, and at least one is a TF upstream of others. So, the correct option should have G2 as the TF. So, looking at the options, options A and D have G2 as TF (A has G1, no. B has G2, C has G2, D has G2).

Wait, looking again:

Options:

A) G1 is TF → incorrect, since G2 is the TF.

B) G2 is TF → correct.

C) G2 is TF → correct.

D) G2 is TF → correct.

So, options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Among these, which has the right relationships.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the absence of G1 (g3), G3's effect would be seen. But in g3, G3 is present, but resistance is 50%. In g1g3, G3 is absent, so resistance is 10% (as G1 is also absent). So perhaps G1 is required for G3's function. So, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but in the absence of G1, G3 can't function. So in g3, G1 is present, so G3 can function. So in g3, G3's function is 50%, which is lower than wild type. In g1g3, G1 is absent, so G3 can't function, leading to 10% resistance. So, that model would fit.

So, G1 is epistatic to G3. Because the function of G3 depends on G1.

So, in option C, G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would fit.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3, and so G1 is epistatic to G3.

Looking at the options, option C says: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

The 'pleiotropy' part is uncertain, but the key points are G2 is TF, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the interaction between three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine plants resistant to the fungal disease anthracnose. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key observations are:

1. **g2 mutant**: Resistance is 0%, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes.
2. **g1 mutant**: Resistance is 75%, suggesting that G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.
3. **g3 mutant**: Resistance is 50%, indicating that G3 also contributes to resistance but less so than G1.
4. **Double mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: Resistance is 0%, consistent with g2 alone, confirming that G2 is epistatic to G1.
   - **g2g3**: Resistance is 0%, consistent with g2 alone, confirming that G2 is epistatic to G3.
   - **g1g3**: Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a manner that is not redundant but rather additive or complementary.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor (TF), which is inconsistent with the data. The data strongly suggests that G2 is the TF, as its knockout results in 0% resistance, and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, which aligns with the data. However, it claims that G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which is unlikely because their single mutants (g1 and g3) have different resistance levels (75% and 50%, respectively). Additionally, it states that G3 is epistatic to G1, which does not fit the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance (10%) than either single mutant. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, which is correct. It also states that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which is plausible as they contribute to resistance but have distinct effects. Importantly, it states that G1 is epistatic to G3. This aligns with the data: in the absence of G1 (g1), G3 still contributes to resistance (50%), but in the absence of both G1 and G3 (g1g3), resistance drops to 10%, indicating that G1 is required for G3's full function. Thus, G1 is epistatic to G3. This option fits the data well.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, which is correct. However, it claims that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which is inconsistent with the data. If G1 and G3 were redundant, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the worse single mutant (either g1 or g3). Instead, g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a manner where G1 is epistatic to G3. This is best captured by **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read through it again and understand what's going on.

The question is about gene interactions and disease resistance in white lupine. We've got three genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants for each, and some double mutants. The idea is that at least one of these is a transcription factor upstream of others. The resistance levels are given for each mutant and their combinations.

So the data shows:

- g1 (mutant for G1): 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10% (so even worse than either alone)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So gene B is epistatic to gene A if the phenotype of A depends on B. Also, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here these genes are about disease resistance, so maybe not relevant unless the genes affect multiple aspects.

Wait, but the question asks about the interaction between these genes. Since G2 knockout has 0% resistance, that suggests that G2 is crucial for resistance. Because without G2, the plants can't resist the disease at all.

Looking at the double mutants, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. Same as when G2 is knocked out alone. That might suggest that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is not working, then even if G1 is present, it doesn't matter because G2's function is needed for G1's effect. Or wait, maybe G2 is the transcription factor upstream of G1. Let's think about how that would work.

If G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate the expression of other genes, like G1 and/or G3. So, if G2 is non-functional (g2), then those downstream genes (G1 and G3) wouldn't be expressed or active. So, in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, which could be because without G2, none of the downstream genes are working.

Looking at the other mutants: g1 is at 75%, which is better than g2 but worse than wild type. So G1 contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. G3 is at 50%, which is worse than wild type, so it's also contributing.

Now, the double mutants: when G1 and G2 are both knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is 0%. But wait, in g2 alone, it's already 0%, so what's the effect of knocking out G1 in addition? If G1 is downstream of G2, then in g2, G1 isn't functioning anyway. So knocking out G1 in g2 would have the same effect, which it does (0%). So that suggests G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g1g3 has resistance 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). That implies that when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance in a redundant way—like if one is working, there's enough resistance, but when both are gone, it's worse. So redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate for the other. But in this case, when both are out, the resistance drops further, so maybe they are additive but not redundant? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another way: in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than both g1 (75) and g3 (50). This suggests that the two genes contribute to resistance in a way that they don't fully compensate for each other. So if you have only G1, resistance is 75, which is not as good as wild type. If you have only G3, it's 50. So when both are missing, it's worse than either alone. So maybe they're in the same pathway, but not necessarily redundant.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates both G1 and G3. Let me model it.

If G2 is a TF (transcription factor), it turns on G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g2, both are off, so no resistance.

In g1, G2 is still working, so G3 is on. Hence, g1 has 75% resistance. But without G1, perhaps the resistance depends on G3? And if G3 is active, the resistance is lower than when both are active.

Wait, but in g1, G3 is active because G2 is working. So if G3 alone gives 50% resistance, but when G1 is also present, they add up to 100% (wild type). Hmm, but g1 is 75%—so that's not matching. Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but have additive effects. So when both are present, their combined effect is 100%, but individually, they contribute 75% and 50% respectively. But that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, and G3 is also downstream of G2.

Wait, the data for g1 is 75% resistance. So without G1, the resistance is 75%—which is better than g3's 50% but worse than wild type. So perhaps G1 is involved in a more minor pathway or maybe G1 is working in parallel to G3.

Wait, another approach: epistatic relationships. Let's look at the double mutants.

In the g1g2 double mutant, resistance is 0%. But since g2 is 0% alone, this suggests that G1's effect depends on G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the absence of G2, G1 can't function. So G2 is upstream.

Similarly, in the g2g3 double mutant, resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So G3's effect is also dependent on G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So G2 is the transcription factor because it's the one that's upstream.

Now, looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is 10%. That's lower than either g1 (75) or g3 (50). So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps their combined knockout makes things worse. But how?

Wait, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, and they are additive, then knocking out both would reduce the resistance further. So maybe G1 contributes 75% - 50% = 25% of the resistance, and G3 contributes 50% - 25% = 25%? Not sure, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So if G2 is the upstream TF activating both, then in the wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, both are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. When only G1 is knocked out, G3 is active, leading to 50% (since G3 alone gives 50%?), but wait the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. Let me make a table.

Wild type: 100% (so all genes are functional).

g1: 75% → missing G1. So if G1 contributes 25% to the resistance. Because without it, resistance is 75%—so G1 normally adds 25% on top of others.

Wait no, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps G1 is part of a redundant system. Let's think about gene redundancy. If two genes are redundant, they can compensate for each other. So, in a double mutant, the phenotype would be worse than each single mutant.

But in this case, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant. Because if they were redundant, the single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double mutant. But here, the double mutant is worse than both singles. So that suggests they are additive, perhaps.

Wait, but the other double mutants: g1g2 is 0%, which is same as g2. So that's consistent with G2 being upstream of G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0% same as g2. So G2 is upstream of G3 as well.

So, the key point is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Now, the question is about which option is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. But from the data, G2 is epistatic to G1, as in the absence of G2 (g2), G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1. But the option says G1 is a TF, which I don't think is correct because the data suggests G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Same promoter? Maybe that's not the right model. Also, does G3 epistatic to G1? From the data, when G1 and G3 are both out, the resistance is worse than either. So perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3? Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But here, the question is about resistance. I'm not sure if that's the case. Also, in option C, G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. But how? Let me think. If g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, that suggests that in the absence of both, the effect is worse. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and both contribute to resistance. If G1 is upstream of G3, then G1 would be epistatic to G3. Because the function of G3 depends on G1.

Wait, but in the case where G1 is upstream, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function regardless of its own status. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is non-functional because G1 is upstream. But wait, in the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is higher than g1g3's 10%. So that can't be right. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, then in g1, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so g1 should have the same as g1g3. But g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%, and higher than g1g3's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is upstream of G1. If G3 is upstream, then in g3, G1 is not functional. But g3 has 50% resistance, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that also doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think again. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's function masks G3's. So in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 would be seen. So in the g1g3 double mutant, you'd see the effect of G3. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using epistatic relationships. Let's think about what each double mutant shows.

In g1g2, resistance is 0%. Since g2 is 0%, that's the same. So G1's effect is only present when G2 is active. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

So G2 is the main gene; without it, everything else doesn't matter.

Now, the only other double mutant with non-zero is g1g3 at 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than when either is knocked out.

So in the presence of G2, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So when G1 is out, G3 is still present, giving 50% resistance. When G3 is out, G1 is present, giving 75% resistance. But when both are out, the resistance is 10%.

So G1 and G3 are contributing in a way that their combined absence is worse than either alone. That suggests that they work in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the effect of the double mutant wouldn't be worse than the single mutants. For example, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then knocking out both would only be as bad as the worse single mutant. But here, it's worse than both, which suggests they are additive.

So, the model is: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive (75 +50 = 125, but that's more than 100, so perhaps the wild type is 100, so G1 alone gives 75, G3 alone gives 50, but together, it's 100. But the data for g1 and g3 don't fit that model as in, when G1 is out, the resistance is 75, which would be G3 alone. So without G1, G3 is active, giving 50%? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active, giving 100% resistance. In g1, G3 is active, giving 50%, but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the presence of G1 or G3 is sufficient for some level of resistance. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined activity adds up. So when G1 and G3 are both present, the resistance is 100%; when G1 is out, resistance is 50% (because G3 is active), but the data says g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So when G1 is out, the resistance drops to 75%, which is worse than wild type. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. G3 contributes 50%, but when both are out, it drops to 10%. Wait that doesn't make sense. Maybe G1 contributes 25 (100 -75) and G3 contributes 50, but when both are out, 100 -25 -50 =25, but the data is 10%, which is less than 25.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic toward G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that if either G1 or G3 is present, the same function is done. So if you knock out G1, G3 can compensate, and vice versa. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So if they were redundant, their single mutants would have the same phenotype as the double mutant. But here, the double mutant is 10% compared to 75 and 50. So that doesn't fit; redundancy would require that the double mutant is as bad as the worse single mutant. So that can't be right. So option D is likely incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But in this scenario, it's about resistance. I'm not sure about that part. The epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, the effect would be determined by G1. But the data says g1g3 is worse than g1 (75) and worse than g3 (50). So that doesn't fit the model. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic toward G1. Same promoter would imply they are co-regulated. But I don't see how that would directly explain the data. Also, G3 being epistatic to G1 would mean that in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. But in the data, when G3 is out (g3), G1 is present and resistance is 75%. If G3 were epistatic, then in g3, G1's effect wouldn't matter. But resistance is 50% in g3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should model each option's scenario.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3. So, G1's function is upstream of G3. So in the absence of G1 (g1), G3 can't function. But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which would imply that in the absence of G3, G1 is functional. Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then G3's function depends on G1. So in g1, G3 should not be functional. But if g3 alone is 50%, that suggests that in the presence of G1 (i.e., wild type), G3 contributes 50% to resistance. So in that case, g1 (where G3 is functional) would have 50% + something from G1?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% resistance.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of the double mutant would depend on G1. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than either, so that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as g3. But the data isn't matching that either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this in terms of how much each gene contributes.

Assuming G2 is the TF, it's required for the activation of G1 and G3.

In the wild type, all three are functional, so resistance is 100%.

In g1: G2 is okay, so G3 is active. G1 is not active. Resistance is 75%. So perhaps G1 contributes 25% to resistance. G3 contributes 75%? Because 75% (g1) = 100% - 25% (G1's contribution).

In g3: G2 is okay, so G1 is active. G3 is not. Resistance is 50%. So G3 contributes 50%, because 100% - 50% =50% (g3's resistance).

Wait, that would mean G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So when both are knocked out (g1g3), the total would be 100% -25% -50% =25%, but data shows 10% resistance. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps they are not additive.

Alternatively, maybe the two genes are part of the same pathway. So their combined knockout would not just subtract but have a more severe effect. Maybe they function in a linear pathway, and only the last step matters.

Wait, for example, let's say G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So in g1, G3 isn't activated, leading to lower resistance. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%. That doesn't fit. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, g1 would have the same as g1g3 (since G3 wouldn't be active). But g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which is different.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Another approach: Let's construct a model.

G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance.

So:

Wild type: G2 → G1 active, G2 → G3 active → resistance 100%.

g1: G2 → G3 active → resistance 50% (but the data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute in a way that their combined activity is additive, but each has a base level of activity without the other. So, when both are present, it's 100%, when only G1 is present, it's 75%, when only G3 is present, it's 50%, and when neither is present, it's 25% (but the data for g1g3 is 10%). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is required for G1 and G3, which in turn are required for a step in the disease resistance pathway. So, without G2, you can't activate G1 and G3, so no resistance (g2 is 0%). G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So when G1 is out, G3 is active, leading to 50% resistance (g1 is 75%? No, that doesn't fit.)

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, I think G2 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. If they have same promoter, then knocking out G1 would also knock out G3, but in the data, g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%. So they aren't the same. Therefore, option B is unlikely.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits. But in this scenario, it's about just resistance. I'm not sure about that. But perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to other traits, but that's not relevant here. The key is the epistatic relationship.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that would mean that in the absence of G1, G3's function is worse than when G1 is present. So perhaps G1 is required for G3's function. So G3's effect is downstream of G1.

Wait, but in that case, knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from being functional. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that would mean that G3 is only partially functional in the absence of G1, which contradicts the idea that G1 is epistatic to G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the absence of G3, G1's effect doesn't matter. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which would mean that in the absence of G3, G1 is functional. So that would fit if G3's function is downstream of G1. Then, in the absence of G3, G1 can't function, so resistance would be lower. But the data shows g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50% and worse than wild type.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a pathway.

If G2 → G1 → G3.

So G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. Then:

- Wild type: G3 is active, resistance 100%.

- g2: G1 and G3 inactive → resistance 0%.

- g1: G3 inactive → resistance 0%, but data shows 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 → G1 and G2 → G3. Both G1 and G3 independently contribute to resistance. So in g1, G3 is active, giving 50% (but data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates G1, which also activates another gene (let's call it G4) that's involved in resistance. But this is getting too speculative.

Maybe it's time to make a decision based on the data and the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. Unlikely, since G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. Unlikely because their single mutants have different resistances.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3. I'm not sure about the pleiotropy, but the epistatic part: G1 is epistatic to G3. So in the absence of G1, G3's effect isn't seen. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is worse than wild type but better than g1g3's 10%. So maybe G3 contributes 50% when G1 is present, but in the absence of G1, G3 can't contribute, leading to 10%? That doesn't fit the data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. Redundancy would mean that knocking out both would have the same effect as the worse single mutant. But data shows 10%, which is worse than either. So D is incorrect.

So perhaps option A is incorrect because G2 is the TF, not G1.

Looking back, option C says G2 is TF. So considering that, which is correct.

Another angle: the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 function in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a severe defect. But why would the single mutants not be as bad?

Wait, maybe G1 is required for G3's function. So in the absence of G1, G3 can't function, so resistance would drop. But in the data, g3 has 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is required for G1's function. In g3, G1 can't function, leading to 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 have partial functions. For instance, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, but together they contribute 75%. Then, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 25% (100 -75 =25%). But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is less than 25%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pathway requires both G1 and G3. So, if either is missing, the resistance is lower, but if both are missing, it's the worst. So, perhaps the pathway is G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance. So, each contributes to the pathway, but both are needed for maximum resistance. So in the single mutants, you lose some resistance, and in the double, you lose all. But that doesn't fit the numbers.

Wait, another model: G2 activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute a part to the resistance. In the wild type, both are present, giving full resistance (100%). If G1 is knocked out, G3 provides 50% resistance (so g1 is 75%? No, data says g1 is 75%). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So, in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are off. In the absence of G1, G3 is off. So g1 would have 0% resistance. But data says g1 is 75%, so that's not matching.

Wait, maybe G2 activates G1, which can function on its own, and G2 also activates G3, which can also function on its own. So, in the absence of G2, both are off. In the absence of G1, G3 is active, giving 50%. In the absence of G3, G1 is active, giving 75%. When both are absent, resistance is 0%. But the data says g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about epistasis.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So, if gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the presence of a certain allele in gene B determines whether the phenotype of gene A is expressed.

In our case, the presence of G2 determines whether G1 and G3 can function. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That's clear because without G2, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3.

Now, among G1 and G3, their combined effect in the double mutant is worse than either single. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways, and each contributes to resistance.

So, the model is:

- G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in parallel pathways.

So, when G1 is knocked out, G3 still contributes 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G1 contributes more than G3. So if G1 is out, resistance drops by 25% (from 100 to 75). G3 is out, drops by 50% (from 100 to 50). When both are out, drops by an additional 25 (from 75 to 50?), but the data shows 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, in the wild type, G1 and G3 together contribute 100. If G1 is out, G3 contributes 50. If G3 is out, G1 contributes 75. If both are out, resistance is 25. But the data shows 10% in g1g3. So perhaps the model is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes to the activity of a downstream gene. So, the more upstream genes you knock out, the worse the resistance.

But I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should look for which option correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and the fact that G1 and G3 are not redundant, but their combined absence causes more severe resistance.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

I'm not sure about the pleiotropy. But since G2 is the TF, that part is correct. The interaction between G1 and G3 in the double mutant would suggest that G1 is epistatic to G3 if G1's function is upstream. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1 if G3's function is upstream.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. Which is worse than either single mutant. So, perhaps the functions of G1 and G3 are additive but not independent. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is more than just the sum. But I'm not sure how that applies to epistasis.

Another thought: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. So in g3, G1 is present, so G3's effect is seen. But in g1g3, since G1 is absent, G3's absence doesn't matter. But the data shows g1g3 is worse than g3, which suggests that G3 contributes more when G1 is absent. So maybe it's the opposite: G3 is epistatic to G1.

But I'm getting stuck and time is limited. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive. So, the only option that matches this is option A or C. But I'm not sure about the pleiotropy part.

Wait, the question says the three candidate genes are of unknown function, and at least one is a TF upstream of others. So, the correct option should have G2 as the TF. So, looking at the options, options A and D have G2 as TF (A has G1, no. B has G2, C has G2, D has G2).

Wait, looking again:

Options:

A) G1 is TF → incorrect, since G2 is the TF.

B) G2 is TF → correct.

C) G2 is TF → correct.

D) G2 is TF → correct.

So, options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Among these, which has the right relationships.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the absence of G1 (g3), G3's effect would be seen. But in g3, G3 is present, but resistance is 50%. In g1g3, G3 is absent, so resistance is 10% (as G1 is also absent). So perhaps G1 is required for G3's function. So, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but in the absence of G1, G3 can't function. So in g3, G1 is present, so G3 can function. So in g3, G3's function is 50%, which is lower than wild type. In g1g3, G1 is absent, so G3 can't function, leading to 10% resistance. So, that model would fit.

So, G1 is epistatic to G3. Because the function of G3 depends on G1.

So, in option C, G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would fit.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3, and so G1 is epistatic to G3.

Looking at the options, option C says: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

The 'pleiotropy' part is uncertain, but the key points are G2 is TF, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So the correct answer is option C.


The question involves determining the interaction between three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine plants resistant to the fungal disease anthracnose. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key observations are:

1. **g2 mutant**: Resistance is 0%, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes.
2. **g1 mutant**: Resistance is 75%, suggesting that G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.
3. **g3 mutant**: Resistance is 50%, indicating that G3 also contributes to resistance but less so than G1.
4. **Double mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: Resistance is 0%, consistent with g2 alone, confirming that G2 is epistatic to G1.
   - **g2g3**: Resistance is 0%, consistent with g2 alone, confirming that G2 is epistatic to G3.
   - **g1g3**: Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a manner that is not redundant but rather additive or complementary.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor (TF), which is inconsistent with the data. The data strongly suggests that G2 is the TF, as its knockout results in 0% resistance, and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, which aligns with the data. However, it claims that G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which is unlikely because their single mutants (g1 and g3) have different resistance levels (75% and 50%, respectively). Additionally, it states that G3 is epistatic to G1, which does not fit the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance (10%) than either single mutant. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, which is correct. It also states that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which is plausible as they contribute to resistance but have distinct effects. Importantly, it states that G1 is epistatic to G3. This aligns with the data: in the absence of G1 (g1), G3 still contributes to resistance (50%), but in the absence of both G1 and G3 (g1g3), resistance drops to 10%, indicating that G1 is required for G3's full function. Thus, G1 is epistatic to G3. This option fits the data well.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, which is correct. However, it claims that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which is inconsistent with the data. If G1 and G3 were redundant, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as the worse single mutant (either g1 or g3). Instead, g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a manner where G1 is epistatic to G3. This is best captured by **Option C**.
