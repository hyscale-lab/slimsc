Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look right. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a column vector with complex numbers, but here the elements are (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think I remember that the state vector needs to be normalized. So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate the magnitude squared of each component and sum them.

So the vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the length squared is 6, which means the vector isn't normalized. So the actual state vector would be this vector divided by sqrt(6), right? Because the state vector's length should be 1. So the state vector |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2,1 ]^T.

Wait, but the problem just says the state is this column matrix. So I'll proceed with that, but I'll have to normalize it when calculating probabilities.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down P's elements. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0,1/sqrt(2),0]. So P looks like:

[ 0           1/√2       0     ]
[1/√2        0          1/√2  ]
[ 0           1/√2       0     ]

Wait, I'm thinking about this. Observables are Hermitian matrices, right? Let me check if P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's transpose P and see.

Transposing P, the rows become columns. So the first column becomes [0,1/√2, 0], which is the first row of the original P. The second column is [1/√2,0,1/√2], which becomes the second row of the transposed, but the original P's second row is [1/√2,0,1/√2], so that matches. The third column is [0,1/√2, 0], which is the third row of the original. So P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So that's correct for an observable.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring 0 when the observable P is measured. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and see if 0 is one of them. Because the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are its eigenvalues.

So first step: find the eigenvalues of P. Let me compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I ) = 0.

So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

Row 1: [0 - λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0 - λ]

The determinant is |P - λ I| = 

Let me compute the determinant:

| -λ      1/√2      0     |
|1/√2    -λ      1/√2    |
| 0      1/√2     -λ     |

I'll compute this determinant. Hmm, perhaps using expansion by minors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see. The matrix P has a certain structure. Let me think about the eigenvalues.

Another approach: perhaps there's symmetry that can help. Let me consider the vectors. For instance, what are the eigenvectors of P?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Suppose λ is 0. Let me plug λ=0 into the matrix and see if the determinant is zero.

So P becomes:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row2:1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row3:0, 1/√2, 0

The determinant of this matrix when λ=0. Let me compute it.

Wait, the matrix is:

[ 0  a  0 ]
[ a  0  a ]
[0  a  0 ]

Where a =1/√2.

The determinant of this matrix can be calculated.

Let me compute the determinant:

The matrix is:

Row1: 0, a, 0
Row2: a, 0, a
Row3: 0, a, 0

I can compute this determinant by expanding along the first row.

The determinant is 0*(minor) - a * minor + 0 * minor. So only the second term matters.

The minor for the element (1,2) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row1 and column2. So:

[ a  a ]
[ a  0 ]

The determinant of that is a*(0) -a * a = -a².

So the determinant of P when λ=0 is 0 - a * (-a²) + 0 = a^3.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:

The determinant is sum over columns of element * (-1)^(i+j) * minor.

For 3x3:

det = m11*(m22*m33 - m23*m32) - m12*(m21*m33 - m23*m31) + m13*(m21*m32 - m22*m31)

So for the matrix at λ=0:

m11=0, m12=a, m13=0
m21=a, m22=0, m23=a
m31=0, m32=a, m33=0

So det = 0*(0*0 - a*a) - a*(a*0 - a*0) + 0*(a*a - 0*0)
= 0 - a*(0) + 0 = 0.

Wait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, so at λ=0, the determinant is 0. So 0 is an eigenvalue of P.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I should compute the determinant correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues another way.

Let me consider that the matrix P is a 3x3 matrix with certain symmetries. Let me think of it as a graph. The matrix is symmetric and has non-zero elements only in certain positions. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the eigenvectors.

But maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

So the characteristic equation is:

| -λ      1/√2      0     |
|1/√2    -λ      1/√2    |
| 0      1/√2     -λ     |

The determinant is (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, let's compute the determinant step by step.

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

So:

det = (-λ) * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ]) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ]) + 0 * det(...) 

So the first term is (-λ) times [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = (-λ)(λ² - (1/2)).

The second term is (-1/√2) times the determinant of the minor matrix. The minor for the (1,2) element is the matrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0, -λ]

The determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ/√2).

So the second term becomes (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (-λ)/(2).

Wait, wait no, because the expansion is (-1)^(1+2) times the element times the minor. So the sign is negative for the (1,2) element. So the second term is:

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
= - (1/√2) * ( -λ/√2 )
= - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) 
= (λ)/(2).

Wait, because the expansion is:

sum_{j=1 to 3} [ (-1)^{i+j} * a_ij * M_ij ]

where M_ij is the minor.

So for i=1, j=2:

(-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.

So the term is -1 * (1/√2) * [ determinant of the minor ]

The minor for (1,2) is the matrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0, -λ]

Which has determinant (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) )= -λ/√2.

So the term is - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) )= (1/√2) * (λ/√2) )= λ/(2).

The third term is zero because m13 is zero.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2).

Hmm, let me compute this:

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) * (λ^2 - 1/2) ? Wait wait no, I think I messed up.

Wait, no, the expansion is:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) ) - (1/√2)*( [determinant of minor] )

Wait, no, the expansion is:

det = (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] + [ (-1)^(1+2) * (1/√2) * (determinant of minor) ]

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Maybe using row operations to simplify the determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, perhaps the matrix P has eigenvalues that are symmetric.

Wait, considering that P is a symmetric matrix with some pattern, perhaps the eigenvalues are 0 and something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P can be written as the sum of two tensor products or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues by noting that P^2 might have a simpler form.

Let me compute P squared to see if that helps.

P^2 = P * P.

Computing each element:

Element (1,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2)

Element (1,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Element (1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2).

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute each element correctly.

Wait, let's compute P squared. Let me write out P again:

P =
[0, a, 0]
[a, 0, a]
[0, a, 0]

where a = 1/√2.

So P squared is:

First row: [ (0*a + a*a + 0*0), (0* a + a*0 + 0*a ), (0*0 + a*a + 0*0) ]

Wait, no, the standard matrix multiplication: (P^2)_{i,j} = sum_k P_{i,k} P_{k,j}.

So for (1,1):

sum_k P_{1,k} P_{k,1}.

P_{1,1} = 0, P_{1,2} = a, P_{1,3}=0.

So (1,1) element is:

0*P_{1,1} + a*P_{2,1} + 0*P_{3,1}.

P_{2,1} is a.

So 0*0 + a*a +0*0 = a² = 1/2.

Similarly, (1,2) element:

sum P_{1,k} P_{k,2}.

= 0*P_{1,2} + a * P_{2,2} + 0 * P_{3,2}.

P_{2,2} is 0. So 0 + a*0 + 0 = 0.

(1,3) element:

sum P_{1,k} P_{k,3}.

= 0*P_{1,3} + a * P_{2,3} + 0 * P_{3,3}.

P_{2,3} is a. So 0 + a*a +0= a²=1/2.

So first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Second row:

(2,1) element: sum P_{2,k} P_{k,1}.

P_{2,1}=a, P_{2,2}=0, P_{2,3}=a.

So a*P_{1,1} +0*P_{2,1} +a*P_{3,1}.

P_{1,1}=0, P_{2,1}=a, P_{3,1}=0.

So a*0 + 0*a + a*0=0.

Wait, no, wait: P_{k,1} for k=1,2,3.

So (2,1) element: sum_{k=1→3} P_{2,k} P_{k,1}.

So P_{2,1} * P_{1,1} + P_{2,2} * P_{2,1} + P_{2,3} * P_{3,1}.

= a * 0 + 0 * a + a * 0 = 0.

(2,2) element: sum P_{2,k} P_{k,2}.

= a * a + 0 *0 + a * a.

= a² + 0 + a² = 2a² = 2*(1/2) =1.

(2,3) element: sum P_{2,k} P_{k,3}.

= a *0 +0 *a +a *0=0.

Third row: (3,1) element.

sum P_{3,k} P_{k,1}.

P_{3,1}=0, P_{3,2}=a, P_{3,3}=0.

So 0*P_{1,1} + a * P_{2,1} + 0 * P_{3,1}.

= 0 + a*a +0 = a²=1/2.

(3,2) element:

sum P_{3,k} P_{k,2}.

=0* a + a*0 +0 * a =0.

(3,3) element: sum P_{3,k} P_{k,3}.

= 0*0 + a *a +0 *0= a²=1/2.

So P squared matrix is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]
[0, 1, 0]
[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Now, perhaps looking at P squared can help find the eigenvalues.

Because if P^2 has eigenvalues equal to λ^2, where λ are the eigenvalues of P.

Alternatively, perhaps P squared is a diagonal matrix in some basis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the trace of P and P squared.

The trace of P is sum of diagonal elements: 0 +0 +0=0.

The trace of P^2 is 1/2 +1 +1/2= 2.

Hmm, but the trace is equal to sum of eigenvalues. So for P, sum of eigenvalues is 0. For P squared, sum of eigenvalues squared is 2.

But wait, the eigenvalues of P squared are the squares of the eigenvalues of P.

So if the eigenvalues of P are λ1, λ2, λ3, then λ1 + λ2 + λ3 =0 (since trace of P is zero), and λ1^2 + λ2^2 + λ3^2 = 2 (trace of P^2 is 2).

Another thing: the determinant of P is the product of its eigenvalues. So det(P) = λ1 λ2 λ3.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, det(P) is the product of eigenvalues. Let me compute det(P) using the matrix.

Wait, the determinant of P when λ=0 was zero, but when λ is an eigenvalue, the determinant is zero. Hmm, perhaps I should compute the determinant of (P - λ I) to find the characteristic equation, but that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an educated guess about the eigenvalues.

Suppose that P has eigenvalues 0, a, and -a, such that their sum is zero. Because the trace is zero, that makes sense.

Then, the sum of their squares would be 0 + a² + a²= 2a² = 2. So a²=1 → a=1 or -1.

So the eigenvalues would be 0, 1, -1.

Let me check if this satisfies the characteristic equation.

If P has eigenvalues 0,1,-1, then the characteristic equation would be λ(λ-1)(λ+1) )= λ(λ²-1) )= λ^3 - λ =0.

So the equation is λ^3 - λ=0 → λ(λ²-1)=0 → λ=0,1,-1.

Does this match with our P matrix?

Wait, let me compute the determinant of (P - λ I) and see if the characteristic equation is λ^3 - λ =0.

Wait, when I compute the determinant for (P - λ I), the expansion I started earlier was:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) + 0.

Wait, let me compute it again.

The determinant is:

| -λ      a      0     |
| a     -λ      a     |
|0       a     -λ     |

Expanding along the first row:

= (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

= (-λ) (λ^2 - a^2)  - a ( -a λ )

= (-λ)(λ^2 - a^2) + a^2 λ

= -λ^3 + a^2 λ + a^2 λ

= -λ^3 + 2 a^2 λ.

But a is 1/√2, so a²=1/2.

So the determinant is -λ^3 + 2*(1/2) λ = -λ^3 + λ.

Set this equal to zero for eigenvalues: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ(λ^2 -1 )=0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Yes! So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So when the observable P is measured, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. The probabilities relate to the projections of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

The state vector is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T, but it's not normalized. Let's compute its normalization.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2,1 ]^T.

So the state is |ψ> = (1/√6) [ -1; 2; 1 ]

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

The eigenvector satisfies (P -0 I)|v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

The matrix P is:

[0, a, 0]
[a, 0, a]
[0, a, 0]

So the system of equations is:

0*v1 + a v2 +0 v3 =0 → a v2 =0 → v2=0.

a v1 +0 v2 +a v3 =0 → a v1 + a v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

0*v1 + a v2 +0 v3=0 → a v2=0 → v2=0.

So from the first equation, v2=0.

From the second equation, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, v3]^T, with v1 = -v3.

Let me choose v3= t, then v1= -t. So the eigenvector is [ -t, 0, t ]^T = t [ -1, 0,1 ]^T.

So the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is any scalar multiple of [ -1; 0;1 ].

But since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar, I can take the normalized version. The norm of [ -1, 0, 1 ] is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is 1/sqrt(2) [ -1,0,1 ].

Let me denote this as |0> = (1/√2) [ -1; 0; 1 ]

Now, the probability to measure 0 is the square of the amplitude of |0> in the state |ψ>.

The amplitude is the inner product <0|ψ>.

Compute this:

<0|ψ> = (1/√2) [ -1, 0, 1 ] * (1/√6) [ -1; 2; 1 ]

= (1/√2 * 1/√6) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ]

= (1/√12) [1 +0 +1 ]

= (1/√12)(2) = 2/(√12) = (√12)/6 * 2 → wait, wait:

Wait, 2/(√12) = 2/(2√3) )= 1/√3.

So the amplitude is 1/√3. The probability is the square of this: (1/√3)^2 =1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given system and observable. The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This vector is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\| |\psi\rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The observable is represented by the matrix \( P \), with elements:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring 0, we need to determine the eigenvalues of \( P \). The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( P - \lambda I \), the determinant is computed as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring, we find:

\[
\lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \pm 1.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvalue \( 0 \) corresponds to the eigenvector \( |0\rangle \), which satisfies \( P |0\rangle = 0 \). Solving for \( |0\rangle \), we find:

\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the overlap between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Computing the dot product:

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left[ (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + 1(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (1 + 0 + 1) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
