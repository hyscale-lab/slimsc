Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, and we're told to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so that simplifies things a bit.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is probably special relativity because we have two different inertial frames moving relative to each other. When something changes frames, especially at high speeds, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, the problem is about distance traveled. So maybe I need to consider how time and distance transform between the two frames.

Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That means in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at the same speed, 60,000 km/s, right? Because if one frame sees the other moving at v, the other sees the first moving at -v. So the speed is the same magnitude, opposite direction.

The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. Because the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So I think we need to find the distance as observed from the galaxy's frame. So how does time in one frame relate to the other?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about it. The time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta isn't moving; it's stationary, and the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s.

So, the problem is asking: when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame, how far has the ejecta moved in the galaxy's frame?

Wait, but wait, the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So in the galaxy's frame, how much time has passed? Because time would have dilated, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps I should consider using the Lorentz transformations. Because we have two frames moving relative to each other. Let's denote S as the galaxy's frame and S' as the ejecta's frame.

In S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (which is at rest in S') at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at velocity v = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but then in S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, so the galaxy's center is approaching. So the time in S' is 50 seconds. How much time passes in S during that 50 seconds?

Wait, but in S', the ejecta isn't moving, so the distance it travels in S is just v multiplied by the time in S. Wait, no, no. Because the time in S will not be the same as in S'. So perhaps I need to calculate the time that passes in S, then multiply by velocity to get the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance in S is the same as the distance in S' multiplied by the Lorentz factor? Wait, no, because distance is measured differently in each frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the variables.

Let me assign:

- In S (galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center (let's say in the negative x-direction) at speed v = 60,000 km/s.

- In S' (ejecta frame), the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at speed v=60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is stationary, and the galaxy is approaching.

The event is: in S', the center of the galaxy moves towards the ejecta, and after 50 seconds in S', we want to know how much distance the ejecta has moved in S.

Wait, wait, no. The question says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. During that time, the ejecta is stationary (since it's its own frame). So in the galaxy's frame, that same time would be longer due to time dilation. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is shorter.

Wait, but how do we relate the time in S' to the time in S?

I think we need to use the time dilation formula. The time in S (galaxy's frame) would be longer than the time in S' (ejecta's frame) because the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy. So, the time in S (Δt) is equal to gamma multiplied by the time in S' (Δt').

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh, right, but I need to check if v is a significant fraction of c. Let's compute v in km/s: 60,000 km/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c. Because 0.2 of 300,000 is 60,000. So v = 0.2c.

So gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

Wait, wait: 0.2 squared is 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed would be gamma multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame. So Δt = gamma * Δt' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame, which is v multiplied by Δt (galaxy's time). Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and the time is Δt.

So distance is v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm. Close, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps more accurately, let's compute 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 s. Then 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 and 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. Which isn't one of the options. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

But wait, maybe my approximation for gamma is too rough. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897.

So 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020304598.

So gamma is approximately 1.020304598.

So Δt = gamma * 50 s ≈ 1.020304598 * 50 ≈ 51.01523 seconds.

So distance = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.01523 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.01523.

Let me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000, 60,000 * 0.01523 = 913.8.

So total is 3,060,000 + 913.8 ≈ 3,060,913.8 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using the proper length and length contraction.

Wait, from the galaxy's frame, the distance the ejecta travels is just v multiplied by Δt. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering relative motion without relativity, which would be a mistake, but let's see.

Wait, if I ignore relativity and just compute it as 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But I think that approach is wrong because the frames are moving, so time isn't the same.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us into thinking it's a simple velocity multiplied by time, but we need to account for the fact that the time in each frame is different.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simpler than that. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the galaxy's center is approaching the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center would cover a distance of 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But wait, no, that's the distance the galaxy moves in its own frame. But the question is about how far the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame. Hmm, no, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the motion in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but in the galaxy's frame, how much time passes when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but time is dilated. So the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta's clock running slow. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows longer than 50 seconds.

So the time in the galaxy's frame is gamma * 50 ≈ 51.03 s.

So distance is v * Δt = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km, which is about 3.06 million km, matching option D, which is 3,060,000 km.

But wait, perhaps I should use the exact gamma value without approximation. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.2c, so beta = 0.2.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020304598.

So Δt = 50 * 1.020304598 ≈ 51.0152299 s.

Distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0152299 s = 60,000 * 51.0152299.

Let me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 * 0.0152299 ≈ 60,000 * 0.015 = 900, and 60,000 * 0.0002299 ≈ approx 13.794. So total is 900 + 13.794 = 913.794.

So total distance is 3,060,000 + 913.794 = 3,060,913.794 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to approach this is using the velocity addition formula, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the proper time. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (e.g., the supernova and the observation) happen at the same place. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use length contraction. The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is gamma times the ejecta's frame time.

So, yes, that's what I did earlier. So the distance is approximately 3,060,914 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km as option D.

So the answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the galaxy's frame using special relativity. The ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames moving at a relative speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \( \Delta t' = 50 \, \text{s} \), and we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
In special relativity, time dilation occurs between two frames moving relative to each other. The relationship between the time intervals is given by:

\[
\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
\]

Thus, the time in the galaxy's frame is:

\[
\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame
In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a constant speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled is:

\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot \Delta t
\]

Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( \Delta t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \):

\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,914 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with the Options
The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,060,914 \, \text{km} \), which is closest to option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)).

### Conclusion
The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).
