Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z for a given state. Let's see what I remember about this.

The problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that the eigenstates of P_z form the basis for the space we're working in. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), right? So I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then compute the square root of their difference.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the expectation of P_z might not be zero, but since the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, the uncertainty could be non-zero.

First, I should represent the state vector as a column. The given vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that as a column: 

ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

Now, the operator P_z is given as a diagonal matrix. Let me write that:

P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ)

Because the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ, and the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me compute each component. So ψ has entries a, b, c where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

⟨P_z⟩ = a * (ħ) * a + b * 0 * b + c * (-ħ) * c.

Wait, no, wait. The operator is diagonal, so when you multiply, it's just summing the products of each component with the corresponding diagonal element.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (a^2) * ħ + (b^2)*0 + (c^2)*(-ħ) = ħ(a^2 - c^2).

Let me compute a^2 and c^2. a = -1/2, so a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, c is -1/2, so c² is same as a², 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ħ( (1/4) - (1/4) ) = ħ(0) = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Because the state is a superposition of P_z eigenstates. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, each component corresponds to a different eigenvalue.

The state ψ is a linear combination of the eigenstates |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So each component's coefficient squared gives the probability of being in that eigenstate. So for |+z⟩, the coefficient is a=-1/2, so probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly for |-z⟩, same probability. And for |0z⟩, it's (1/√2)^2=1/2.

Since the expectation value is a weighted average of the eigenvalues, it would be (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0. So yes, that's correct.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is the same as the square of each diagonal element. So P_z² is diag(ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is a^2 * ħ² + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * ħ².

Again, a^2 is 1/4, c^2 is 1/4. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's option B. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) sqrt(2)ħ

B) ħ/sqrt(2)

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the state is given, and we're calculating the uncertainty. Is there a better way to compute this, perhaps by diagonalizing P_x and finding the state in terms of P_z eigenstates? No, I think the approach I took is correct because I directly computed the expectation values using the given state.

Wait, another thought: since the state is in an eigenstate of P_x, and P_x, P_y, P_z don't commute, the uncertainties in P_z should be non-zero.

Yes, and that's what we found: ΔP_z = ħ/sqrt(2). So that's option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the basis of its eigenvectors:

\[
P_z = \text{diag}(\hbar, 0, -\hbar).
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of the diagonal matrix $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = \text{diag}(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2).
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
