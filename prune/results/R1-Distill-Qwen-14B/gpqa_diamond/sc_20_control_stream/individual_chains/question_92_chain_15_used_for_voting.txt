Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh wait, but the question gives me bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. So I guess I'll need to use Hess's Law or something related to bond energies.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's visualize that structure. It looks like it's a conjugated diene or something with multiple double bonds maybe. Wait, wait, let me count the double bonds. Oh, I see two double bonds, one in the middle and another towards the end. So that's two double bonds.

But wait, actually, looking again: (CH3)2C=CH-... and then somewhere else there's another CH=C(CH3)2. So yeah, two double bonds. So that's two C=C bonds.

But wait, I'm not sure if the compound is a cyclic or acyclic structure. The formula seems linear, but maybe it's a ring? No, I think it's a straight chain. So each double bond is isolated or conjugated?

But perhaps that's not too important for the calculation. Let me focus on the given data.

The given data is:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, so the energy required to break a C-C bond in a molecule into isolated carbon atoms is 1000 kJ per mol. Wait, no, atomization is breaking molecules into atoms, right. So for carbon, that would be the energy to break all bonds in the molecule into individual C atoms. So for a molecule with n C-C bonds, the atomization would involve breaking those.

Wait, but the bond energies given are for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies, considering all the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

No, wait, that's for reactions. Alternatively, for a molecule, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the bonds formed and broken. But more accurately, the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But here, the problem provides bond energies, so perhaps the method involves considering the total energy of all bonds in the molecule and relating that to the elements.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule to produce gaseous atoms. So, for a molecule, say, CnHm, the atomization would involve breaking all C-C, C-H, and H-H bonds (though H-H is for diatomic H2, but in the molecule, perhaps it's part of the bond energy when considering the formation from elements).

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule as the sum of the bond energies of all its bonds, then relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, let me recall: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies as follows:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in the reactants] - [sum of bond energies in the products]

But wait, no, that's for a reaction. Alternatively, for a molecule, perhaps it's the sum of the bond energies minus the bond energies of the elements.

Wait, let's think in terms of the formation reaction. Suppose the compound is formed from its constituent elements: carbon and hydrogen.

The reaction would be something like:

a C (graphite) + b H2 (g) → 1 mol of compound

The enthalpy change for this reaction is the enthalpy of formation.

But to calculate this using bond energies, I can calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf = [ (bonds broken in reactants) - (bonds formed in product) ]

Wait, no, actually, the formula is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

ΔHf°(compound) = Σ [ bond energies of bonds in elements ] – Σ [ bond energies of bonds in compound ]

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

The bond energies of the elements are in their standard states. For example, H2 has H-H bonds, and C is in the form of graphite, which has C-C bonds.

So, when forming the compound, bonds are broken in the elements and new bonds are formed in the compound.

The enthalpy change (ΔHf°) is equal to the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (reactants) minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound (products) are formed.

So, the formula should be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

Wait, that makes sense. Because breaking bonds requires energy (endothermic), and forming bonds releases energy (exothermic). So the change is the energy used to break the reactant bonds minus the energy released when product bonds form.

So, in this case, the reactants are elemental carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas (H2). The product is the given compound.

So, I need to calculate the total bond energy of the reactants (C and H2) and subtract the total bond energy of the product (the compound).

But wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe that's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule and produce isolated atoms. So for the compound, the atomization energy would be the sum of all the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the atomization energy of the compound and relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, here's another method: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies and the atomization energies of the elements.

The formula I remember is:

ΔHf°(compound) = [Σ (atomization energies of elements)] - [Σ (bond energies in compound)]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Oh, right! The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔHf° = (Σ ΔH_atomization of elements) - (Σ ΔH_bonds in compound)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I think is:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products)

But in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the products are the bonds in the compound.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it using the concept that the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, maybe the equation is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of atomization of H) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in the compound ]

Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization of H (H2) is the bond energy for H-H, which is given as 100 kJ/mol.

Wait, let's re-express this. The enthalpy of atomization for an element is the energy required to completely break all bonds in one mole of the element into gaseous atoms. So for carbon, which is in a solid state (graphite), the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. For H2, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2, so per mole of H2, it's 100 kJ to break into 2 H atoms.

So, for the reaction:

C (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 (g)

The enthalpy change ΔHf° is the enthalpy of formation of the compound.

But to compute this using bond energies, we can consider the energy changes involved.

The formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × ΔH_atom_C) + (n_H2 × ΔH_H2) ] – [ Σ (bond energies in the compound) × moles ]

Wait, perhaps that's the way.

Wait, another way to think about it is using the bond energies as follows. The enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product.

But I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by:

ΔHf° = [ (sum of bond energies in the elements) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the compound ]

Wait, but the elements are in their standard states, which are C (graphite) and H2 (g).

So, the sum of bond energies in the elements would be:

For each C atom in graphite: the bond energy is given as the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So if a molecule has n C atoms, each C is from graphite, which has C-C bonds. Wait, but graphite is a network solid, so each C atom is bonded to three others. So the enthalpy of atomization per mole of C is 1000 kJ. So per mole of C, 1000 kJ is needed to break all bonds and make gaseous C atoms.

Similarly, for H2, each mole has one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ/mol.

So, for the reaction, if the compound has m C atoms and n H atoms, the total energy for the reactants (elements) would be:

(m × 1000 kJ) + ( (n/2) × 100 kJ )

Because each H2 molecule contributes one H-H bond, and each contributes 100 kJ. So for n H atoms, we have (n/2) moles of H2, each contributing 100 kJ.

Then, the bond energies in the compound are the sum of all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2) × 100 ) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in the compound ]

Wait, but wait, the sum of all bond energies in the compound is the sum of all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So, the bond energies in the compound would be:

sum_bond = (number of C-C bonds × 200) + (number of C=C × 300) + (number of C-H × 400) 

So, putting it all together:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2 ) × 100 ) ] - [ (C-C bonds ×200) + (C=C bonds ×300) + (C-H bonds ×400) ]

Wait, but wait, the sum in the reactants is the energy needed to break the bonds in the elements (atomization), while the sum in the products is the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed. So the formula should be:

ΔHf° = (energy to break reactant bonds) - (energy to form product bonds)

Which is the same as:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

So, yes, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2 ) × 100 ) ] - [ sum_bond ]

Now, I need to determine the number of C and H atoms in the compound, and count the number of each type of bond.

Let's look at the compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2*(CH3) → 2 C and 6 H each. Wait, but wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2 group is on a central C.

Looking for the number of C and H:

Let me break it down:

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 groups attached to a central C.

The structure is:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the carbons and hydrogens.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H.

Wait, the entire molecule:

Looking at each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : So, that's a central C (C1) attached to two CH3 groups, a double bond to CH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each part:

But actually, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2 C and 6 H, but when attached to another C, that's part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to count the entire formula.

The formula of the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write the formula as Cn Hm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to break down each part:

Each CH3 contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Looking at each part:

The structure can be written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each part:

Start from the left:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: This part is (CH3)2C-CH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all carbons first.

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 attached to a central C. So that's 3 C's (the central C and two CH3 C's). But wait, no: each CH3 is a CH3 group, so the central C is attached to two CH3 groups, each of which is a CH3- group. So for each (CH3)2C, it's one C from the central and two from the CH3 groups: 3 C's.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just count each carbon.

Let me list each carbon in the structure:

1. The first (CH3)2C=CH- group: has 3 C's (the two CH3 Cs and the central C).

2. Then CH-CH2-: this is a CH connected to a CH2.

3. Then CH(CH3)-: another CH with a CH3.

4. Then CH2-: another CH2.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: this has the central C attached to two (CH3) groups and a double bond to another C.

Wait, perhaps I should number each C and count:

But perhaps it's easier to just count the total number of C and H.

Wait, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2*(CH3) → 2 C and 6 H per group. But in the molecule, there are two such groups, one at each end.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end has a (CH3)2C=C... and ...C=CH(C3)2.

Wait, but it's a chain, so perhaps it's better to count all the carbons.

Let me count the carbons:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's (the central C, and two CH3 C's)
- Then CH2: 2 C's? No, wait, CH2 is just one C. So each CH2 adds one C.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C in the structure:

The structure is:

C(CH3)2=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So that's:

1. C(CH3)2: 3 C's (the central C and the two from CH3)
2. =C: 1 C
3. -CH2: 1 C
4. -CH(CH3): 1 C
5. -CH2: 1 C
6. -CH=C(CH3)2: 3 C's (central C, and two from CH3)
So total C's: 3 + 1 + 1 +1 +1 +3 = 10 C's.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each end is a (CH3)2C=CH- and a CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is a chain with two double bonds.

But regardless, perhaps I should proceed by counting the number of C and H atoms.

Let me write the formula.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each (CH3)2C= as a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Now, to count the number of C atoms:

Each (CH3)2C= group has 3 C's. Similarly, each CH=C(CH3)2 group has 3 C's. The central chain is CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH.

Wait, maybe it's easier to draw it, but without that, let me proceed with the counting.

Each (CH3)2C= group has 3 C's (the central C and two from CH3). Similarly, the other end has another (CH3)2C=, which is another 3 C's.

In between, we have a chain: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH.

Each CH is one C, CH2 is one C, CH(CH3) is one C, etc.

Wait, let's count:

- (CH3)2C=CH: that's 3 C's (the central C, and two from CH3)
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH: 1 C
- Then =CH-C(CH3)2: that's 3 C's (the central C, and two from CH3 on each side)

Wait, no, the end is CH=C(CH3)2: that's a central C connected via a double bond to another C (which is part of CH=C(CH3)2). So perhaps that's 3 C's as well.

So adding up:

3 (from first group) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH(CH3)) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 3 (from the end group) = 11 C's?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule's formula is C10 H16.

Wait, why? Because the structure seems to have two (CH3)2 groups, each contributing (2 C and 6 H × 2 groups = 4 C and 12 H?), but perhaps that's not accurate.

Wait, another approach: The molecule is symmetric, perhaps. Let me see.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Which can be written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, in this structure, each end has a (CH3)2C= group.

Each (CH3)2C= group contributes 3 C and 6 H (since each CH3 has 3 H, and two CH3 groups contribute 6 H, and the central C has one more C).

Wait, perhaps I should count each part.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-

This is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 H.

The C in (CH3)2C is connected to one CH group (CH-), which contributes 1 H.

So the first part has 3 C (from (CH3)2C) and the CH contributes 1 C, making 4 C's? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, (CH3)2C is one C, and the =CH- is another C, so two C's for that part? Wait, no, (CH3)2C is one C, and the =CH- is another C, so that's two C's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the entire structure and count each C and H.

Another approach: Let me write the full structural formula.

The molecule has the following structure:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the initial structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2- etc., which suggests that the first double bond is between C and CH.

Wait, perhaps considering each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: That's a group where a central C is attached to two CH3 groups and has a double bond to a CH group. So the central C is connected via double bond to the CH group. So the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-.

2. Then comes CH2-.

3. Then CH(CH3)-.

4. Then CH2-.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: a group where a central C is connected via double bond to another C, and each has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, but I'm not sure. Let me count all the C and H:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes:

- Each (CH3) is 1 C and 3 H.
- So two (CH3) groups contribute 2 C and 6 H.

In the first part, (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C: 1 C.
- The two CH3 groups: 2 C and 6 H.
- The =CH-: that's 1 C and 1 H (since CH has one H).

So for the first group: 3 C and 7 H.

Wait, but the =CH- is a CH group, which has one H. So in (CH3)2C=CH-, the total is 3 C and 7 H.

Then the next group is CH2-: that's 1 C and 2 H.

Then CH(CH3)-: that's 1 C and (the CH has 1 H) plus the CH3 has 3 H, so total 4 H. So 1 C and 4 H.

Then CH2-: 1 C and 2 H.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: Let's see. The CH= is 1 C and 1 H. The C(CH3)2 is 1 C and 6 H (since two CH3 groups contribute 2×3=6 H). So the CH=C(CH3)2 group is 2 C and 7 H.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each end has (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the total is:

For each (CH3)2 group, 2 C and 6 H.

The molecule has two such groups, so 4 C and 12 H.

Then, the chain in between: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH.

Each part:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- CH(CH3): 1 C, 4 H (1 from CH and 3 from CH3).
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- CH: 1 C, 1 H.

So the chain between the two (CH3)2 groups is: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH, which is 5 C and (1+2+4+2+1)=10 H.

Then, the two (CH3)2 groups contribute 4 C and 12 H.

So total C: 4 (from (CH3)2 groups) +5 (chain) =9 C.

Wait, but that doesn't account for the two double bonds. Wait, perhaps I missed some C's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recount.

Wait, perhaps the chain is:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= is a substituent attached to a double bond.

So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2C= is connected to a CH group, which is connected via a single bond to another CH2, which connects to a CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH, which is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2C= is a substituent on a chain.

So the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C's:

- (CH3)2C= : 3 C (the central C and two from CH3)
- CH: 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH: 1 C
- C(CH3)2: 3 C (central C and two from CH3 groups)
Total C's: 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +3 = 11 C's.

Wait, but that's 11 C's, which would make the formula C11 H?

Wait, what about the H's?

Each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 
- (CH3)2: 6 H
- CH-: 1 H
Total: 7 H

Then CH2-: 2 H
Then CH(CH3): 4 H (1 from CH, 3 from CH3)
Then CH2-: 2 H
Then CH=C(CH3)2: 
- CH: 1 H
- C(CH3)2: 6 H
Total: 7 H.

So the H's are:

7 (first part) +2 +4 +2 +7 = 22 H?

Wait, but that can't be right because each CH2 is between groups, so perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me count each H in each group.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: (CH3)2 contributes 6 H. The C=CH- has one H.
   So 6 + 1 = 7 H.

2. CH2-: 2 H.

3. CH(CH3)-: The CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So 4 H.

4. CH2-: 2 H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: The CH has 1 H, and the C(CH3)2 has 6 H. So 7 H.

Adding up: 7 + 2 +4 +2 +7 = 22 H.

So the formula is C11 H22.

Wait, I'm getting C11 H22, but I'm not sure because earlier counting gave me 11 C's.

But let me check: 11 C, 22 H → C11H22.

Wait, but that would be 11 carbons and 22 hydrogens, so the molecular formula is C11H22.

But wait, I'm not confident in that count, but I'll proceed with that for now.

Now, the next step is to determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

The bonds are:

- C-C (single)
- C=C (double)
- C-H (single)

We need to count the number of each bond.

Let me think: each C-C bond is a single bond between two C atoms.

Each C=C bond is a double bond, but in our count, each C=C is one double bond, which consists of two π bonds and one σ bond (wait, but in bond energy terms, each double bond contributes as a single unit, so each C=C counts as one bond with energy 300 kJ/mol, not considering the individual bonds. So for each double bond, it's considered as one bond with energy 300.

So, let's count:

Number of C-C bonds: Let me imagine the structure.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond between C atoms is a C-C bond.

So the structure has:

- Between (CH3)2C and the =CH: no C-C bond, as it's a double bond.

Wait, no, the (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH, so that's a C=C bond. Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to CH2.

Then, CH2 is connected to CH(CH3), which is connected to CH2, which is connected to CH, which is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So the C-C bonds are:

- Between (CH3)2C and CH (no, that's a double bond)
- Between CH and CH2 (single bond)
- Between CH2 and CH(CH3) (single bond)
- Between CH(CH3) and CH2 (single bond)
- Between CH2 and CH (single bond)
- Between CH and C(CH3)2 (double bond)

Wait, perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Let me try again.

Each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : The (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH.

2. CH-CH2-: single bond between CH and CH2.

3. CH2-CH(CH3): single bond between CH2 and CH(CH3).

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: single bond between CH(CH3) and CH2.

5. CH2-CH: single bond between CH2 and CH.

6. CH=C(CH3)2: double bond between CH and C(CH3)2.

So the C-C bonds are:

Between:

a) CH and CH2 → 1 C-C bond.

b) CH2 and CH(CH3) → 1 C-C bond.

c) CH(CH3) and CH2 → 1 C-C bond.

d) CH2 and CH → 1 C-C bond.

So that's 4 C-C single bonds.

Plus, the two double bonds: between (CH3)2C and CH, and between CH and C(CH3)2. So that's 2 C=C bonds.

Wait, but each double bond is a single unit, but in terms of bond count, each C=C contributes as one bond. So each C=C counts as one bond, but uses two π bonds. But for calculation purposes, each C=C bond contributes 300 kJ as a single bond.

So, the total number of C-C bonds is 4, and C=C bonds is 2.

Now, counting the C-H bonds.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds.

In the structure:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2×3=6 C-H bonds.

The CH groups (from =CH-) and (CH=) contribute 1 each.

The CH2 groups contribute 2 each.

The CH(CH3) group contributes 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4.

So let's count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: C-H bonds in (CH3)2 → 6. The CH- has 1 C-H. Total:7.

2. CH2-: 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-: 4 C-H.

4. CH2-: 2 C-H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 C-H, and the C(CH3)2 has 6 C-H. Total:7.

Adding up: 7 +2 +4 +2 +7=22 C-H bonds.

Wait, but that can't be right because each CH3 has 3 C-H, and the molecule is C11 H22, which has 22 H's. So each H is attached to a C, so 22 C-H bonds.

So number of C-H bonds is 22.

Now, putting it all together.

So:

n_C = 11.

n_H =22.

Number of C-C bonds: 4.

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-H bonds:22.

Now, using the formula for ΔHf°:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2 ) × 100 ) ] - [ (C-C bonds ×200) + (C=C bonds ×300) + (C-H bonds ×400) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

m =11 C atoms.

n_H =22.

So,

ΔHf° = [11 * 1000 + (22/2) * 100 ] - [4 * 200 + 2 * 300 + 22 * 400 ]

Calculate each part:

First part:

11 * 1000 = 11,000 kJ.

(22/2) * 100 =11 *100= 1,100 kJ.

So total for reactants: 11,000 + 1,100 = 12,100 kJ.

Second part:

4 *200 = 800.

2 *300= 600.

22 *400= 8,800.

Total: 800 +600=1,400; 1,400 +8,800=10,200.

So,

ΔHf° = 12,100 - 10,200 = 1,900 kJ/mol.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 11200, option D is 1900 kJ/g which is different. Wait, but the question says enthalpy of formation is for the compound, which is in kJ/mol.

So the calculated ΔHf° is 1900 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is higher. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is not correct as we're calculating per mole. So the correct option should be D if it was per gram, but the calculation is per mole.

Wait, the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol.

B)67.4 kJ/mol.

C)11.44 kJ/g.

D)1900 kJ/g.

Wait, but the calculation gives 1900 kJ/mol, but option A is 11200, and option B is 67.4. None of the options is 1900 kJ/mol. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the C-C and C=C bonds.

Let me try again.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking for C-C bonds:

Each single bond between carbons counts.

Looking at the chain:

The (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond (C=C) to CH.

Then, CH is connected via single bond to CH2.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3): single bond.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2: single bond.

CH2 connected to CH: single bond.

CH connected via double bond to C(CH3)2.

So, the single C-C bonds are:

1. CH-CH2.

2. CH2-CH(CH3).

3. CH(CH3)-CH2.

4. CH2-CH.

That's four C-C single bonds, as before.

Double bonds: two C=C bonds.

So that part seems correct.

C-H bonds:22, as the molecule has 22 H atoms.

So, the calculation must be correct, but the options don't have 1900 kJ/mol. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula uses the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ per mole, but perhaps we should calculate based on the number of moles of carbon in the compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the enthalpy of atomization as the energy needed to break all bonds in the compound into isolated atoms.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (Σ atoms * ΔH_atomization) - Σ (bonds in compound * bond energy)

So for each C in the compound, we take 1000 kJ/mol, and for each H, since H is in H2, we take (1/2)*100 kJ/mol (since each H2 molecule contributes one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ/mol).

So for the compound:

Number of C atoms:11 → 11 *1000 =11,000 kJ.

Number of H atoms:22 → 22 * (1/2 *100) =22 *50=1100 kJ.

Total for elements:11,000 +1,100=12,100 kJ.

Now, the bonds in the compound are:

C-C:4 → 4 *200=800.

C=C:2 →2 *300=600.

C-H:22 →22 *400=8,800.

Total bonds energy:800 +600=1400; 1400 +8800=10,200.

So, ΔHf°=12,100 -10,200 =1,900 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. Wait, looking again, the options:

A) 11200 kJ/mol.

B)67.4 kJ/mol.

C)11.44 kJ/g.

D)1900 kJ/g.

Hmm, none of these is 1900 kJ/mol. But option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is per gram, but our calculation is per mole. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molar mass and convert.

The molar mass of C11H22:

Carbon:12 *11=132.

Hydrogen:1*22=22.

Total:132+22=154 g/mol.

So, if the ΔHf° is 1900 kJ/mol, then per gram it would be 1900 /154 ≈12.33 kJ/g, which is close to option C (11.44) but not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, but why is the calculated enthalpy of formation positive? It implies that the compound is endothermic to form, which seems unlikely considering hydrocarbons often have negative enthalpies of formation. But perhaps the given data is hypothetical.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is not 4. Let me re-examine the structure.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the chain is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → double bond between C and CH.

2. CH-CH2- → single bond.

3. CH2-CH(CH3) → single bond.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2 → single bond.

5. CH2-CH → single bond.

6. CH=C(CH3)2 → double bond.

So the single bonds are between:

a) CH-CH2 → C-C bond.

b) CH2-CH(CH3) → C-C bond.

c) CH(CH3)-CH2 → C-C bond.

d) CH2-CH → C-C bond.

So that's four C-C bonds, correct.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds:22.

So the bond count seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ per mole, but perhaps per C atom. So for 11 C atoms, it's 11 *1000 =11,000 kJ. Yes.

H may have been miscalculated. Let me recount H bonds.

Each (CH3)2 group: 2 CH3 → 2*3=6 H.

The =CH-: 1 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3)=4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 (from CH) + 2*3=6 (from CH3 groups) =7 H.

So H count is:

6 (from (CH3)2) +1 +2 +4 +2 +7 =22.

Yes, correct.

So, the calculation must be correct, but the options do not include 1900 kJ/mol. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but the closest is option D: 1900 kJ/g, but that's per gram, which doesn't make sense as the calculation is per mole.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo and option A is 1900 instead of 11200. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is per mole of C, not per mole of compound. So for each C atom, 1000 kJ/mol. So for 11 C atoms, it's 11 *1000=11,000.

But wait, the way the question presents the data says 'enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol'—so per mole of C, not per mole of compound.

So the calculation seems correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is the negative of what I calculated, but that would require the formula to be:

ΔHf° = [sum of bonds in products] - [sum of bonds in reactants]

Which would give -1900 kJ/mol. But that's not among the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of combustion or something else, but no, the question is about enthalpy of formation.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the calculation in another way.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the bond energies of the product.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

The formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum (bonds in elements)] - [sum (bonds in compound)]

So, bonds in elements:

For C: 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

For H2: 100 kJ/mol per molecule.

So, for 11 C atoms: 11 *1000=11,000.

For 22 H atoms: (22/2) *100=1,100.

Total reactants bonds:12,100.

Bonds in compound: 4*200 + 2*300 + 22*400 =800 +600 +8800=10,200.

So ΔHf°=12,100 -10,200=1,900 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is different. Let me recount.

Alternative approach: perhaps the formula is C10H16.

Wait, let me recount the carbons and hydrogens.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3, so 2 C each, but the central C is part of the group.

So (CH3)2C= is 3 C's.

At each end, there are two (CH3)2 groups, so 3 C each ×2=6 C? Or no, because each (CH3)2 group is attached to a C that's part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. So perhaps each end contributes 3 C's, but perhaps the middle has more C's.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C10H16.

If that's the case, then:

n_C=10, n_H=16.

Let me recompute with that.

n_C=10.

n_H=16.

Bond counts:

Assume that the compound has a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

But without correctly knowing the structure, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is C10H16, which is a common formula for alkenes.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps I made an error in the initial approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ per mole of C, but in the compound, the number of C is 10, not 11.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct molecular formula is C10H16.

So let me try that.

n_C=10.

n_H=16.

Now, recomputing:

ΔHf° = [ (10 *1000) + (16/2 *100) ] - [ sum_bond ]

Sum_bond = (number of C-C bonds *200) + (number of C=C bonds *300) + (number of C-H *400)

But I need to determine the number of each bond.

Assuming the molecule is C10H16, which is a diene, perhaps with two double bonds.

So, number of C=C bonds=2.

Each double bond is considered as one bond, so 2.

Now, the number of C-C bonds.

In an alkene, the structure would have a chain.

For a 10-carbon molecule with two double bonds, perhaps there are 7 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C bonds.

Wait, but without the exact structure, it's difficult, but perhaps I can proceed with an estimate.

Assuming the molecule has 8 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C bonds.

But perhaps another approach: the total number of bonds in the molecule.

Each carbon in a chain has four bonds. For a molecule with 10 C's, the total number of bonds is (10 *4 - H)/2. Wait, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, the number of single C-C bonds can be determined as follows:

Each C in a chain (except the ends) has two C-C bonds. The ends have one.

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the previous calculation, but that gave 1900 kJ/mol which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I misread the structure. Let me read it again.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a bicyclic compound or something else, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as 1900 kJ/mol, and see which option is closest.

But the options don't have 1900. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is not per mole of C, but per mole of CO2 or something else. But the question states it's 1000 kJ/mol for carbon.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the given bond energies, treating the reaction as:

Elements (C and H2) → compound.

So, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (atomization) minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

So, the formula remains as before.

But perhaps the given options are in kJ/g, not per mole.

So, the molar mass is 154 g/mol.

So, 1900 kJ/mol → 1900 / 154 ≈12.33 kJ/g.

But option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate the bond energies.

Wait, let me recheck the bond energies:

C-C:200 kJ/mol.

C=C:300.

C-H:400.

H-H:100.

Yes.

So, perhaps the mistake is in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is higher. Let me recount.

In the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The C-C single bonds are:

Between CH and CH2 →1.

Between CH2 and CH(CH3) →1.

Between CH(CH3) and CH2 →1.

Between CH2 and CH →1.

That's four C-C single bonds.

If I missed any, perhaps I should count more.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is longer. Let me try to write the structure again.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each segment is connected by single bonds except the double bonds.

So, number of C-C single bonds: between each pair.

So, the four single bonds as before.

Thus, the bond count seems correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200.

Wait, but my calculation gives 1900, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the way I calculated the H's. Let me recount.

If the molecule is C10H16, then n_C=10, n_H=16.

So,

ΔHf° = [ (10 *1000) + (16/2 *100) ] - [ sum_bond ]

= 10,000 + 800 =10,800.

sum_bond: Let's say 8 C-C bonds, 2 C=C, 16 C-H.

sum_bond=8*200=1600 +2*300=600 +16*400=6400 → total 1600+600=2200; 2200+6400=8600.

So ΔHf°=10,800 -8,600=2,200 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

sum_bond=7*200=1400 +2*300=600 +16*400=6400 → total=1400+600=2000 +6400=8400.

ΔHf=10,800 -8,400=2,400.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps the intended answer is option B:67.4, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the given data is in kJ per mole of reaction, and I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given per mole of C, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So for 11 C atoms, it's 11 *1000 =11,000.

H is 22 atoms → 22/2 =11 H2 molecules → 11 *100=1,100.

Total:12,100.

sum_bond:4*200=800, 2*300=600, 22*400=8,800 → total 10,200.

ΔHf=12,100 -10,200=1,900 kJ/mol.

So, the correct answer is 1900 kJ/mol, but it's not listed. However, looking at the options, option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is per gram.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, but it's in grams. But the question asks for per mole, so this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B:67.4, but I don't see how.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is different. Let me recount C and H.

If the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-C(CH3)2, with two double bonds, but perhaps the number of C's is 10.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200, but I don't see how that comes about.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the enthalpy per gram, not per mole.

In that case, with molar mass 154 g/mol, 1900 kJ/mol is 1900 /154 ≈12.33 kJ/g, which is close to option C:11.44 kJ/g. But that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200 kJ/mol, which would require a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts. Let me think.

If the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there are more C-C bonds.

For example, if the molecule is (CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2=C, which might have more single bonds.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have a simpler approach.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = [ (number of C ×1000) + (number of H ×50) ] - [ (number of C-C ×200) + (number of C=C ×300) + (number of C-H ×400) ]

So, using this formula.

If the molecule is C11H22, then:

ΔHf = (11*1000)+(22*50) - [ (4*200)+(2*300)+(22*400) ]

= 11,000 + 1,100 → 12,100.

Minus (800 +600 +8800 )=10,200.

ΔHf=1900.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the given data is bond dissociation energies in kJ per mole, and the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the intended choice is option A, which is 11200, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ/g, so 1900 /154≈12.3 kJ/g, which is not an option. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is close but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has fewer H's. Let me recount.

If the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2 CH3 →6 H.

The =CH- group has 1 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH(CH3) has 1 H (CH) +3 H (CH3) →4 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2 has 1 H (CH) + 6 H (two CH3 groups) →7 H.

So total H:6 +1 +2 +4 +2 +7=22.

Yes, 22 H.

Thus, the calculation holds.

So, the correct answer should be 1900 kJ/mol, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the correct option is A, which is 11200 kJ/mol, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the correct formula is C10H16.

Then,

n_C=10.

n_H=16.

So,

ΔHf = [10 *1000 + (16/2)*100 ] - [ sum_bond ]

sum_bond: let's say 7 C-C bonds, 2 C=C, 16 C-H.

So,

sum_bond=7*200=1400 +2*300=600 →2000; 16*400=6400 → total 8400.

ΔHf=10,000 +800=10,800 →10,800 -8400=2400 kJ/mol. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But I can't see how that would come about.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of atomization per molecule, which would be wrong, but let's try.

Each C atom in the compound requires 1000 kJ to atomize. So for 11 C, 11,000 kJ.

Each H requires 50 kJ (since H2 is 100 kJ per mole, so per H atom, 50).

22 H →1100.

Total:12,100.

Minus sum_bond:10,200.

ΔHf=1900.

Still same result.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, but it's in grams, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A:11200 kJ/mol, but I don't see the calculation leading there.

I think I'll have to go with the calculation, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But given the options, perhaps option A is the intended answer, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**: The compound was analyzed, and the molecular formula was identified as **C11H22**. This was based on counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the structure.

2. **Bond energy contributions**:
   - **C-C bonds**: There are 4 single C-C bonds in the molecule.
   - **C=C bonds**: There are 2 double C=C bonds in the molecule.
   - **C-H bonds**: There are 22 C-H bonds in the molecule.

3. **Enthalpy of atomization**:
   - Carbon (C): 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.
   - Hydrogen (H): 100 kJ/mol per H2 molecule (50 kJ/mol per H atom).

4. **Calculate the total energy for the reactants (elements)**:
   - For 11 C atoms: \( 11 \times 1000 = 11,000 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - For 22 H atoms: \( 22 \times 50 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total for reactants: \( 11,000 + 1,100 = 12,100 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Calculate the total energy for the bonds in the compound**:
   - C-C bonds: \( 4 \times 200 = 800 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - C=C bonds: \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - C-H bonds: \( 22 \times 400 = 8,800 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total for bonds in the compound: \( 800 + 600 + 8,800 = 10,200 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Energy for reactants} - \text{Energy for bonds in compound}
   \]
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 12,100 - 10,200 = 1,900 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

7. **Convert to kJ/g (optional)**:
   - Molar mass of \( \text{C11H22} \): \( 11 \times 12 + 22 \times 1 = 154 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - Per gram: \( \frac{1,900}{154} \approx 12.33 \, \text{kJ/g} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol)**: This is far too high compared to the calculated value of 1,900 kJ/mol.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This is also far too low and does not match the calculation.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**: This is close to the calculated value of \( 12.33 \, \text{kJ/g} \), but not exact.
- **Option D (1,900 kJ/g)**: This is incorrect because the calculation was performed per mole, not per gram.

### Conclusion:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is \( 1,900 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), which is not explicitly listed among the options. However, the closest match in terms of magnitude is **Option D (1,900 kJ/g)**, despite the inconsistency in units. Given the options, **Option D** is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh wait, but the question gives me bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. So I guess I'll need to use Hess's Law or something related to bond energies.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's visualize that structure. It looks like it's a conjugated diene or something with multiple double bonds maybe. Wait, wait, let me count the double bonds. Oh, I see two double bonds, one in the middle and another towards the end. So that's two double bonds.

But wait, actually, looking again: (CH3)2C=CH-... and then somewhere else there's another CH=C(CH3)2. So yeah, two double bonds. So that's two C=C bonds.

But wait, I'm not sure if the compound is a cyclic or acyclic structure. The formula seems linear, but maybe it's a ring? No, I think it's a straight chain. So each double bond is isolated or conjugated?

But perhaps that's not too important for the calculation. Let me focus on the given data.

The given data is:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, so the energy required to break a C-C bond in a molecule into isolated carbon atoms is 1000 kJ per mol. Wait, no, atomization is breaking molecules into atoms, right. So for carbon, that would be the energy to break all bonds in the molecule into individual C atoms. So for a molecule with n C-C bonds, the atomization would involve breaking those.

Wait, but the bond energies given are for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies, considering all the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

No, wait, that's for reactions. Alternatively, for a molecule, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the bonds formed and broken. But more accurately, the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But here, the problem provides bond energies, so perhaps the method involves considering the total energy of all bonds in the molecule and relating that to the elements.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule to produce gaseous atoms. So, for a molecule, say, CnHm, the atomization would involve breaking all C-C, C-H, and H-H bonds (though H-H is for diatomic H2, but in the molecule, perhaps it's part of the bond energy when considering the formation from elements).

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule as the sum of the bond energies of all its bonds, then relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, let me recall: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies as follows:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in the reactants] - [sum of bond energies in the products]

But wait, no, that's for a reaction. Alternatively, for a molecule, perhaps it's the sum of the bond energies minus the bond energies of the elements.

Wait, let's think in terms of the formation reaction. Suppose the compound is formed from its constituent elements: carbon and hydrogen.

The reaction would be something like:

a C (graphite) + b H2 (g) → 1 mol of compound

The enthalpy change for this reaction is the enthalpy of formation.

But to calculate this using bond energies, I can calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf = [ (bonds broken in reactants) - (bonds formed in product) ]

Wait, no, actually, the formula is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

ΔHf°(compound) = Σ [ bond energies of bonds in elements ] – Σ [ bond energies of bonds in compound ]

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

The bond energies of the elements are in their standard states. For example, H2 has H-H bonds, and C is in the form of graphite, which has C-C bonds.

So, when forming the compound, bonds are broken in the elements and new bonds are formed in the compound.

The enthalpy change (ΔHf°) is equal to the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (reactants) minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound (products) are formed.

So, the formula should be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

Wait, that makes sense. Because breaking bonds requires energy (endothermic), and forming bonds releases energy (exothermic). So the change is the energy used to break the reactant bonds minus the energy released when product bonds form.

So, in this case, the reactants are elemental carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas (H2). The product is the given compound.

So, I need to calculate the total bond energy of the reactants (C and H2) and subtract the total bond energy of the product (the compound).

But wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe that's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule and produce isolated atoms. So for the compound, the atomization energy would be the sum of all the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the atomization energy of the compound and relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, here's another method: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies and the atomization energies of the elements.

The formula I remember is:

ΔHf°(compound) = [Σ (atomization energies of elements)] - [Σ (bond energies in compound)]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Oh, right! The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following equation:

ΔHf° = (Σ ΔH_atomization of elements) - (Σ ΔH_bonds in compound)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I think is:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products)

But in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the products are the bonds in the compound.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it using the concept that the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, maybe the equation is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of atomization of H) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in the compound ]

Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization of H (H2) is the bond energy for H-H, which is given as 100 kJ/mol.

Wait, let's re-express this. The enthalpy of atomization for an element is the energy required to completely break all bonds in one mole of the element into gaseous atoms. So for carbon, which is in a solid state (graphite), the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. For H2, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2, so per mole of H2, it's 100 kJ to break into 2 H atoms.

So, for the reaction:

C (graphite) + 2 H2 (g) → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 (g)

The enthalpy change ΔHf° is the enthalpy of formation of the compound.

But to compute this using bond energies, we can consider the energy changes involved.

The formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × ΔH_atom_C) + (n_H2 × ΔH_H2) ] – [ Σ (bond energies in the compound) × moles ]

Wait, perhaps that's the way.

Wait, another way to think about it is using the bond energies as follows. The enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product.

But I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by:

ΔHf° = [ (sum of bond energies in the elements) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the compound ]

Wait, but the elements are in their standard states, which are C (graphite) and H2 (g).

So, the sum of bond energies in the elements would be:

For each C atom in graphite: the bond energy is given as the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So if a molecule has n C atoms, each C is from graphite, which has C-C bonds. Wait, but graphite is a network solid, so each C atom is bonded to three others. So the enthalpy of atomization per mole of C is 1000 kJ. So per mole of C, 1000 kJ is needed to break all bonds and make gaseous C atoms.

Similarly, for H2, each mole has one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ/mol.

So, for the reaction, if the compound has m C atoms and n H atoms, the total energy for the reactants (elements) would be:

(m × 1000 kJ) + ( (n/2) × 100 kJ )

Because each H2 molecule contributes one H-H bond, and each contributes 100 kJ. So for n H atoms, we have (n/2) moles of H2, each contributing 100 kJ.

Then, the bond energies in the compound are the sum of all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2) × 100 ) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in the compound ]

Wait, but wait, the sum of all bond energies in the compound is the sum of all C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So, the bond energies in the compound would be:

sum_bond = (number of C-C bonds × 200) + (number of C=C × 300) + (number of C-H × 400) 

So, putting it all together:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2 ) × 100 ) ] - [ (C-C bonds ×200) + (C=C bonds ×300) + (C-H bonds ×400) ]

Wait, but wait, the sum in the reactants is the energy needed to break the bonds in the elements (atomization), while the sum in the products is the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed. So the formula should be:

ΔHf° = (energy to break reactant bonds) - (energy to form product bonds)

Which is the same as:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

So, yes, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2 ) × 100 ) ] - [ sum_bond ]

Now, I need to determine the number of C and H atoms in the compound, and count the number of each type of bond.

Let's look at the compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2*(CH3) → 2 C and 6 H each. Wait, but wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2 group is on a central C.

Looking for the number of C and H:

Let me break it down:

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 groups attached to a central C.

The structure is:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the carbons and hydrogens.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H.

Wait, the entire molecule:

Looking at each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : So, that's a central C (C1) attached to two CH3 groups, a double bond to CH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each part:

But actually, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2 C and 6 H, but when attached to another C, that's part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to count the entire formula.

The formula of the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write the formula as Cn Hm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to break down each part:

Each CH3 contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Looking at each part:

The structure can be written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each part:

Start from the left:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: This part is (CH3)2C-CH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all carbons first.

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 attached to a central C. So that's 3 C's (the central C and two CH3 C's). But wait, no: each CH3 is a CH3 group, so the central C is attached to two CH3 groups, each of which is a CH3- group. So for each (CH3)2C, it's one C from the central and two from the CH3 groups: 3 C's.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just count each carbon.

Let me list each carbon in the structure:

1. The first (CH3)2C=CH- group: has 3 C's (the two CH3 Cs and the central C).

2. Then CH-CH2-: this is a CH connected to a CH2.

3. Then CH(CH3)-: another CH with a CH3.

4. Then CH2-: another CH2.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: this has the central C attached to two (CH3) groups and a double bond to another C.

Wait, perhaps I should number each C and count:

But perhaps it's easier to just count the total number of C and H.

Wait, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2*(CH3) → 2 C and 6 H per group. But in the molecule, there are two such groups, one at each end.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end has a (CH3)2C=C... and ...C=CH(C3)2.

Wait, but it's a chain, so perhaps it's better to count all the carbons.

Let me count the carbons:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's (the central C, and two CH3 C's)
- Then CH2: 2 C's? No, wait, CH2 is just one C. So each CH2 adds one C.

Wait, perhaps I should count each C in the structure:

The structure is:

C(CH3)2=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So that's:

1. C(CH3)2: 3 C's (the central C and the two from CH3)
2. =C: 1 C
3. -CH2: 1 C
4. -CH(CH3): 1 C
5. -CH2: 1 C
6. -CH=C(CH3)2: 3 C's (central C, and two from CH3)
So total C's: 3 + 1 + 1 +1 +1 +3 = 10 C's.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each end is a (CH3)2C=CH- and a CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is a chain with two double bonds.

But regardless, perhaps I should proceed by counting the number of C and H atoms.

Let me write the formula.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each (CH3)2C= as a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Now, to count the number of C atoms:

Each (CH3)2C= group has 3 C's. Similarly, each CH=C(CH3)2 group has 3 C's. The central chain is CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH.

Wait, maybe it's easier to draw it, but without that, let me proceed with the counting.

Each (CH3)2C= group has 3 C's (the central C and two from CH3). Similarly, the other end has another (CH3)2C=, which is another 3 C's.

In between, we have a chain: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH.

Each CH is one C, CH2 is one C, CH(CH3) is one C, etc.

Wait, let's count:

- (CH3)2C=CH: that's 3 C's (the central C, and two from CH3)
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH: 1 C
- Then =CH-C(CH3)2: that's 3 C's (the central C, and two from CH3 on each side)

Wait, no, the end is CH=C(CH3)2: that's a central C connected via a double bond to another C (which is part of CH=C(CH3)2). So perhaps that's 3 C's as well.

So adding up:

3 (from first group) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH(CH3)) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 3 (from the end group) = 11 C's?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule's formula is C10 H16.

Wait, why? Because the structure seems to have two (CH3)2 groups, each contributing (2 C and 6 H × 2 groups = 4 C and 12 H?), but perhaps that's not accurate.

Wait, another approach: The molecule is symmetric, perhaps. Let me see.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Which can be written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, in this structure, each end has a (CH3)2C= group.

Each (CH3)2C= group contributes 3 C and 6 H (since each CH3 has 3 H, and two CH3 groups contribute 6 H, and the central C has one more C).

Wait, perhaps I should count each part.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-

This is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 H.

The C in (CH3)2C is connected to one CH group (CH-), which contributes 1 H.

So the first part has 3 C (from (CH3)2C) and the CH contributes 1 C, making 4 C's? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, (CH3)2C is one C, and the =CH- is another C, so two C's for that part? Wait, no, (CH3)2C is one C, and the =CH- is another C, so that's two C's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the entire structure and count each C and H.

Another approach: Let me write the full structural formula.

The molecule has the following structure:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the initial structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2- etc., which suggests that the first double bond is between C and CH.

Wait, perhaps considering each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: That's a group where a central C is attached to two CH3 groups and has a double bond to a CH group. So the central C is connected via double bond to the CH group. So the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-.

2. Then comes CH2-.

3. Then CH(CH3)-.

4. Then CH2-.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: a group where a central C is connected via double bond to another C, and each has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, but I'm not sure. Let me count all the C and H:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes:

- Each (CH3) is 1 C and 3 H.
- So two (CH3) groups contribute 2 C and 6 H.

In the first part, (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C: 1 C.
- The two CH3 groups: 2 C and 6 H.
- The =CH-: that's 1 C and 1 H (since CH has one H).

So for the first group: 3 C and 7 H.

Wait, but the =CH- is a CH group, which has one H. So in (CH3)2C=CH-, the total is 3 C and 7 H.

Then the next group is CH2-: that's 1 C and 2 H.

Then CH(CH3)-: that's 1 C and (the CH has 1 H) plus the CH3 has 3 H, so total 4 H. So 1 C and 4 H.

Then CH2-: 1 C and 2 H.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: Let's see. The CH= is 1 C and 1 H. The C(CH3)2 is 1 C and 6 H (since two CH3 groups contribute 2×3=6 H). So the CH=C(CH3)2 group is 2 C and 7 H.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm counting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each end has (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the total is:

For each (CH3)2 group, 2 C and 6 H.

The molecule has two such groups, so 4 C and 12 H.

Then, the chain in between: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH.

Each part:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- CH(CH3): 1 C, 4 H (1 from CH and 3 from CH3).
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- CH: 1 C, 1 H.

So the chain between the two (CH3)2 groups is: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH, which is 5 C and (1+2+4+2+1)=10 H.

Then, the two (CH3)2 groups contribute 4 C and 12 H.

So total C: 4 (from (CH3)2 groups) +5 (chain) =9 C.

Wait, but that doesn't account for the two double bonds. Wait, perhaps I missed some C's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recount.

Wait, perhaps the chain is:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= is a substituent attached to a double bond.

So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2C= is connected to a CH group, which is connected via a single bond to another CH2, which connects to a CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH, which is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2C= is a substituent on a chain.

So the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C's:

- (CH3)2C= : 3 C (the central C and two from CH3)
- CH: 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH: 1 C
- C(CH3)2: 3 C (central C and two from CH3 groups)
Total C's: 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +3 = 11 C's.

Wait, but that's 11 C's, which would make the formula C11 H?

Wait, what about the H's?

Each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 
- (CH3)2: 6 H
- CH-: 1 H
Total: 7 H

Then CH2-: 2 H
Then CH(CH3): 4 H (1 from CH, 3 from CH3)
Then CH2-: 2 H
Then CH=C(CH3)2: 
- CH: 1 H
- C(CH3)2: 6 H
Total: 7 H.

So the H's are:

7 (first part) +2 +4 +2 +7 = 22 H?

Wait, but that can't be right because each CH2 is between groups, so perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me count each H in each group.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: (CH3)2 contributes 6 H. The C=CH- has one H.
   So 6 + 1 = 7 H.

2. CH2-: 2 H.

3. CH(CH3)-: The CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So 4 H.

4. CH2-: 2 H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: The CH has 1 H, and the C(CH3)2 has 6 H. So 7 H.

Adding up: 7 + 2 +4 +2 +7 = 22 H.

So the formula is C11 H22.

Wait, I'm getting C11 H22, but I'm not sure because earlier counting gave me 11 C's.

But let me check: 11 C, 22 H → C11H22.

Wait, but that would be 11 carbons and 22 hydrogens, so the molecular formula is C11H22.

But wait, I'm not confident in that count, but I'll proceed with that for now.

Now, the next step is to determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

The bonds are:

- C-C (single)
- C=C (double)
- C-H (single)

We need to count the number of each bond.

Let me think: each C-C bond is a single bond between two C atoms.

Each C=C bond is a double bond, but in our count, each C=C is one double bond, which consists of two π bonds and one σ bond (wait, but in bond energy terms, each double bond contributes as a single unit, so each C=C counts as one bond with energy 300 kJ/mol, not considering the individual bonds. So for each double bond, it's considered as one bond with energy 300.

So, let's count:

Number of C-C bonds: Let me imagine the structure.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond between C atoms is a C-C bond.

So the structure has:

- Between (CH3)2C and the =CH: no C-C bond, as it's a double bond.

Wait, no, the (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH, so that's a C=C bond. Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to CH2.

Then, CH2 is connected to CH(CH3), which is connected to CH2, which is connected to CH, which is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So the C-C bonds are:

- Between (CH3)2C and CH (no, that's a double bond)
- Between CH and CH2 (single bond)
- Between CH2 and CH(CH3) (single bond)
- Between CH(CH3) and CH2 (single bond)
- Between CH2 and CH (single bond)
- Between CH and C(CH3)2 (double bond)

Wait, perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Let me try again.

Each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : The (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH.

2. CH-CH2-: single bond between CH and CH2.

3. CH2-CH(CH3): single bond between CH2 and CH(CH3).

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: single bond between CH(CH3) and CH2.

5. CH2-CH: single bond between CH2 and CH.

6. CH=C(CH3)2: double bond between CH and C(CH3)2.

So the C-C bonds are:

Between:

a) CH and CH2 → 1 C-C bond.

b) CH2 and CH(CH3) → 1 C-C bond.

c) CH(CH3) and CH2 → 1 C-C bond.

d) CH2 and CH → 1 C-C bond.

So that's 4 C-C single bonds.

Plus, the two double bonds: between (CH3)2C and CH, and between CH and C(CH3)2. So that's 2 C=C bonds.

Wait, but each double bond is a single unit, but in terms of bond count, each C=C contributes as one bond. So each C=C counts as one bond, but uses two π bonds. But for calculation purposes, each C=C bond contributes 300 kJ as a single bond.

So, the total number of C-C bonds is 4, and C=C bonds is 2.

Now, counting the C-H bonds.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds.

In the structure:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2×3=6 C-H bonds.

The CH groups (from =CH-) and (CH=) contribute 1 each.

The CH2 groups contribute 2 each.

The CH(CH3) group contributes 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4.

So let's count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: C-H bonds in (CH3)2 → 6. The CH- has 1 C-H. Total:7.

2. CH2-: 2 C-H.

3. CH(CH3)-: 4 C-H.

4. CH2-: 2 C-H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 C-H, and the C(CH3)2 has 6 C-H. Total:7.

Adding up: 7 +2 +4 +2 +7=22 C-H bonds.

Wait, but that can't be right because each CH3 has 3 C-H, and the molecule is C11 H22, which has 22 H's. So each H is attached to a C, so 22 C-H bonds.

So number of C-H bonds is 22.

Now, putting it all together.

So:

n_C = 11.

n_H =22.

Number of C-C bonds: 4.

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-H bonds:22.

Now, using the formula for ΔHf°:

ΔHf° = [ (m × 1000) + ( (n_H / 2 ) × 100 ) ] - [ (C-C bonds ×200) + (C=C bonds ×300) + (C-H bonds ×400) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

m =11 C atoms.

n_H =22.

So,

ΔHf° = [11 * 1000 + (22/2) * 100 ] - [4 * 200 + 2 * 300 + 22 * 400 ]

Calculate each part:

First part:

11 * 1000 = 11,000 kJ.

(22/2) * 100 =11 *100= 1,100 kJ.

So total for reactants: 11,000 + 1,100 = 12,100 kJ.

Second part:

4 *200 = 800.

2 *300= 600.

22 *400= 8,800.

Total: 800 +600=1,400; 1,400 +8,800=10,200.

So,

ΔHf° = 12,100 - 10,200 = 1,900 kJ/mol.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 11200, option D is 1900 kJ/g which is different. Wait, but the question says enthalpy of formation is for the compound, which is in kJ/mol.

So the calculated ΔHf° is 1900 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is higher. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is not correct as we're calculating per mole. So the correct option should be D if it was per gram, but the calculation is per mole.

Wait, the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol.

B)67.4 kJ/mol.

C)11.44 kJ/g.

D)1900 kJ/g.

Wait, but the calculation gives 1900 kJ/mol, but option A is 11200, and option B is 67.4. None of the options is 1900 kJ/mol. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the C-C and C=C bonds.

Let me try again.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking for C-C bonds:

Each single bond between carbons counts.

Looking at the chain:

The (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond (C=C) to CH.

Then, CH is connected via single bond to CH2.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3): single bond.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2: single bond.

CH2 connected to CH: single bond.

CH connected via double bond to C(CH3)2.

So, the single C-C bonds are:

1. CH-CH2.

2. CH2-CH(CH3).

3. CH(CH3)-CH2.

4. CH2-CH.

That's four C-C single bonds, as before.

Double bonds: two C=C bonds.

So that part seems correct.

C-H bonds:22, as the molecule has 22 H atoms.

So, the calculation must be correct, but the options don't have 1900 kJ/mol. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula uses the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ per mole, but perhaps we should calculate based on the number of moles of carbon in the compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the enthalpy of atomization as the energy needed to break all bonds in the compound into isolated atoms.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (Σ atoms * ΔH_atomization) - Σ (bonds in compound * bond energy)

So for each C in the compound, we take 1000 kJ/mol, and for each H, since H is in H2, we take (1/2)*100 kJ/mol (since each H2 molecule contributes one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ/mol).

So for the compound:

Number of C atoms:11 → 11 *1000 =11,000 kJ.

Number of H atoms:22 → 22 * (1/2 *100) =22 *50=1100 kJ.

Total for elements:11,000 +1,100=12,100 kJ.

Now, the bonds in the compound are:

C-C:4 → 4 *200=800.

C=C:2 →2 *300=600.

C-H:22 →22 *400=8,800.

Total bonds energy:800 +600=1400; 1400 +8800=10,200.

So, ΔHf°=12,100 -10,200 =1,900 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. Wait, looking again, the options:

A) 11200 kJ/mol.

B)67.4 kJ/mol.

C)11.44 kJ/g.

D)1900 kJ/g.

Hmm, none of these is 1900 kJ/mol. But option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is per gram, but our calculation is per mole. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molar mass and convert.

The molar mass of C11H22:

Carbon:12 *11=132.

Hydrogen:1*22=22.

Total:132+22=154 g/mol.

So, if the ΔHf° is 1900 kJ/mol, then per gram it would be 1900 /154 ≈12.33 kJ/g, which is close to option C (11.44) but not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, but why is the calculated enthalpy of formation positive? It implies that the compound is endothermic to form, which seems unlikely considering hydrocarbons often have negative enthalpies of formation. But perhaps the given data is hypothetical.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is not 4. Let me re-examine the structure.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the chain is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → double bond between C and CH.

2. CH-CH2- → single bond.

3. CH2-CH(CH3) → single bond.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2 → single bond.

5. CH2-CH → single bond.

6. CH=C(CH3)2 → double bond.

So the single bonds are between:

a) CH-CH2 → C-C bond.

b) CH2-CH(CH3) → C-C bond.

c) CH(CH3)-CH2 → C-C bond.

d) CH2-CH → C-C bond.

So that's four C-C bonds, correct.

C=C bonds: two.

C-H bonds:22.

So the bond count seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ per mole, but perhaps per C atom. So for 11 C atoms, it's 11 *1000 =11,000 kJ. Yes.

H may have been miscalculated. Let me recount H bonds.

Each (CH3)2 group: 2 CH3 → 2*3=6 H.

The =CH-: 1 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3)=4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 (from CH) + 2*3=6 (from CH3 groups) =7 H.

So H count is:

6 (from (CH3)2) +1 +2 +4 +2 +7 =22.

Yes, correct.

So, the calculation must be correct, but the options do not include 1900 kJ/mol. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but the closest is option D: 1900 kJ/g, but that's per gram, which doesn't make sense as the calculation is per mole.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo and option A is 1900 instead of 11200. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is per mole of C, not per mole of compound. So for each C atom, 1000 kJ/mol. So for 11 C atoms, it's 11 *1000=11,000.

But wait, the way the question presents the data says 'enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol'—so per mole of C, not per mole of compound.

So the calculation seems correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is the negative of what I calculated, but that would require the formula to be:

ΔHf° = [sum of bonds in products] - [sum of bonds in reactants]

Which would give -1900 kJ/mol. But that's not among the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of combustion or something else, but no, the question is about enthalpy of formation.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the calculation in another way.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the bond energies of the product.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

The formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum (bonds in elements)] - [sum (bonds in compound)]

So, bonds in elements:

For C: 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

For H2: 100 kJ/mol per molecule.

So, for 11 C atoms: 11 *1000=11,000.

For 22 H atoms: (22/2) *100=1,100.

Total reactants bonds:12,100.

Bonds in compound: 4*200 + 2*300 + 22*400 =800 +600 +8800=10,200.

So ΔHf°=12,100 -10,200=1,900 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is different. Let me recount.

Alternative approach: perhaps the formula is C10H16.

Wait, let me recount the carbons and hydrogens.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3, so 2 C each, but the central C is part of the group.

So (CH3)2C= is 3 C's.

At each end, there are two (CH3)2 groups, so 3 C each ×2=6 C? Or no, because each (CH3)2 group is attached to a C that's part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. So perhaps each end contributes 3 C's, but perhaps the middle has more C's.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C10H16.

If that's the case, then:

n_C=10, n_H=16.

Let me recompute with that.

n_C=10.

n_H=16.

Bond counts:

Assume that the compound has a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

But without correctly knowing the structure, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is C10H16, which is a common formula for alkenes.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps I made an error in the initial approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ per mole of C, but in the compound, the number of C is 10, not 11.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct molecular formula is C10H16.

So let me try that.

n_C=10.

n_H=16.

Now, recomputing:

ΔHf° = [ (10 *1000) + (16/2 *100) ] - [ sum_bond ]

Sum_bond = (number of C-C bonds *200) + (number of C=C bonds *300) + (number of C-H *400)

But I need to determine the number of each bond.

Assuming the molecule is C10H16, which is a diene, perhaps with two double bonds.

So, number of C=C bonds=2.

Each double bond is considered as one bond, so 2.

Now, the number of C-C bonds.

In an alkene, the structure would have a chain.

For a 10-carbon molecule with two double bonds, perhaps there are 7 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C bonds.

Wait, but without the exact structure, it's difficult, but perhaps I can proceed with an estimate.

Assuming the molecule has 8 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C bonds.

But perhaps another approach: the total number of bonds in the molecule.

Each carbon in a chain has four bonds. For a molecule with 10 C's, the total number of bonds is (10 *4 - H)/2. Wait, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, the number of single C-C bonds can be determined as follows:

Each C in a chain (except the ends) has two C-C bonds. The ends have one.

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the previous calculation, but that gave 1900 kJ/mol which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I misread the structure. Let me read it again.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a bicyclic compound or something else, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as 1900 kJ/mol, and see which option is closest.

But the options don't have 1900. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is not per mole of C, but per mole of CO2 or something else. But the question states it's 1000 kJ/mol for carbon.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the given bond energies, treating the reaction as:

Elements (C and H2) → compound.

So, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (atomization) minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

So, the formula remains as before.

But perhaps the given options are in kJ/g, not per mole.

So, the molar mass is 154 g/mol.

So, 1900 kJ/mol → 1900 / 154 ≈12.33 kJ/g.

But option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate the bond energies.

Wait, let me recheck the bond energies:

C-C:200 kJ/mol.

C=C:300.

C-H:400.

H-H:100.

Yes.

So, perhaps the mistake is in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is higher. Let me recount.

In the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The C-C single bonds are:

Between CH and CH2 →1.

Between CH2 and CH(CH3) →1.

Between CH(CH3) and CH2 →1.

Between CH2 and CH →1.

That's four C-C single bonds.

If I missed any, perhaps I should count more.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is longer. Let me try to write the structure again.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each segment is connected by single bonds except the double bonds.

So, number of C-C single bonds: between each pair.

So, the four single bonds as before.

Thus, the bond count seems correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200.

Wait, but my calculation gives 1900, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the way I calculated the H's. Let me recount.

If the molecule is C10H16, then n_C=10, n_H=16.

So,

ΔHf° = [ (10 *1000) + (16/2 *100) ] - [ sum_bond ]

= 10,000 + 800 =10,800.

sum_bond: Let's say 8 C-C bonds, 2 C=C, 16 C-H.

sum_bond=8*200=1600 +2*300=600 +16*400=6400 → total 1600+600=2200; 2200+6400=8600.

So ΔHf°=10,800 -8,600=2,200 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

sum_bond=7*200=1400 +2*300=600 +16*400=6400 → total=1400+600=2000 +6400=8400.

ΔHf=10,800 -8,400=2,400.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps the intended answer is option B:67.4, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the given data is in kJ per mole of reaction, and I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given per mole of C, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So for 11 C atoms, it's 11 *1000 =11,000.

H is 22 atoms → 22/2 =11 H2 molecules → 11 *100=1,100.

Total:12,100.

sum_bond:4*200=800, 2*300=600, 22*400=8,800 → total 10,200.

ΔHf=12,100 -10,200=1,900 kJ/mol.

So, the correct answer is 1900 kJ/mol, but it's not listed. However, looking at the options, option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is per gram.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, but it's in grams. But the question asks for per mole, so this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B:67.4, but I don't see how.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is different. Let me recount C and H.

If the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-C(CH3)2, with two double bonds, but perhaps the number of C's is 10.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200, but I don't see how that comes about.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the enthalpy per gram, not per mole.

In that case, with molar mass 154 g/mol, 1900 kJ/mol is 1900 /154 ≈12.33 kJ/g, which is close to option C:11.44 kJ/g. But that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200 kJ/mol, which would require a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts. Let me think.

If the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there are more C-C bonds.

For example, if the molecule is (CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2=C, which might have more single bonds.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have a simpler approach.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = [ (number of C ×1000) + (number of H ×50) ] - [ (number of C-C ×200) + (number of C=C ×300) + (number of C-H ×400) ]

So, using this formula.

If the molecule is C11H22, then:

ΔHf = (11*1000)+(22*50) - [ (4*200)+(2*300)+(22*400) ]

= 11,000 + 1,100 → 12,100.

Minus (800 +600 +8800 )=10,200.

ΔHf=1900.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the given data is bond dissociation energies in kJ per mole, and the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the intended choice is option A, which is 11200, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ/g, so 1900 /154≈12.3 kJ/g, which is not an option. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is close but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has fewer H's. Let me recount.

If the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group has 2 CH3 →6 H.

The =CH- group has 1 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH(CH3) has 1 H (CH) +3 H (CH3) →4 H.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2 has 1 H (CH) + 6 H (two CH3 groups) →7 H.

So total H:6 +1 +2 +4 +2 +7=22.

Yes, 22 H.

Thus, the calculation holds.

So, the correct answer should be 1900 kJ/mol, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the correct option is A, which is 11200 kJ/mol, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the correct formula is C10H16.

Then,

n_C=10.

n_H=16.

So,

ΔHf = [10 *1000 + (16/2)*100 ] - [ sum_bond ]

sum_bond: let's say 7 C-C bonds, 2 C=C, 16 C-H.

So,

sum_bond=7*200=1400 +2*300=600 →2000; 16*400=6400 → total 8400.

ΔHf=10,000 +800=10,800 →10,800 -8400=2400 kJ/mol. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But I can't see how that would come about.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of atomization per molecule, which would be wrong, but let's try.

Each C atom in the compound requires 1000 kJ to atomize. So for 11 C, 11,000 kJ.

Each H requires 50 kJ (since H2 is 100 kJ per mole, so per H atom, 50).

22 H →1100.

Total:12,100.

Minus sum_bond:10,200.

ΔHf=1900.

Still same result.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, but it's in grams, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A:11200 kJ/mol, but I don't see the calculation leading there.

I think I'll have to go with the calculation, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But given the options, perhaps option A is the intended answer, but I'm not sure.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**: The compound was analyzed, and the molecular formula was identified as **C11H22**. This was based on counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the structure.

2. **Bond energy contributions**:
   - **C-C bonds**: There are 4 single C-C bonds in the molecule.
   - **C=C bonds**: There are 2 double C=C bonds in the molecule.
   - **C-H bonds**: There are 22 C-H bonds in the molecule.

3. **Enthalpy of atomization**:
   - Carbon (C): 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.
   - Hydrogen (H): 100 kJ/mol per H2 molecule (50 kJ/mol per H atom).

4. **Calculate the total energy for the reactants (elements)**:
   - For 11 C atoms: \( 11 \times 1000 = 11,000 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - For 22 H atoms: \( 22 \times 50 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total for reactants: \( 11,000 + 1,100 = 12,100 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Calculate the total energy for the bonds in the compound**:
   - C-C bonds: \( 4 \times 200 = 800 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - C=C bonds: \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - C-H bonds: \( 22 \times 400 = 8,800 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total for bonds in the compound: \( 800 + 600 + 8,800 = 10,200 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Energy for reactants} - \text{Energy for bonds in compound}
   \]
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 12,100 - 10,200 = 1,900 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

7. **Convert to kJ/g (optional)**:
   - Molar mass of \( \text{C11H22} \): \( 11 \times 12 + 22 \times 1 = 154 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - Per gram: \( \frac{1,900}{154} \approx 12.33 \, \text{kJ/g} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol)**: This is far too high compared to the calculated value of 1,900 kJ/mol.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This is also far too low and does not match the calculation.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**: This is close to the calculated value of \( 12.33 \, \text{kJ/g} \), but not exact.
- **Option D (1,900 kJ/g)**: This is incorrect because the calculation was performed per mole, not per gram.

### Conclusion:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is \( 1,900 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), which is not explicitly listed among the options. However, the closest match in terms of magnitude is **Option D (1,900 kJ/g)**, despite the inconsistency in units. Given the options, **Option D** is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: D
