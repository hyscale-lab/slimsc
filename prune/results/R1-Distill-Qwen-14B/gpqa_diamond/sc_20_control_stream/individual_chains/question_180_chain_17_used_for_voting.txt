Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Hmm, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. The particles have negligible mass, so I probably don't have to worry about their rest mass or kinetic energy. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Wait, energy in an electrostatic system, so I'm thinking about electric potential energy here. 

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. The formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. 

Since all the charges are identical, each of the 12 charges at point P's location (wait, no, point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. Oh, right, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, meaning they're all at 2m from the fixed charge.

Wait, but the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P, but are they fixed in position relative to each other? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I have to assume that each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not given. Hmm, but for the potential energy, I need to consider all pairs. 

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. Oh, maybe arranging the 12 charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Wait, no, the 12 are constrained to be at 2 meters from P, but perhaps their positions relative to each other can vary. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible, but since they're identical and all positive (since each is 2e, which is positive), they'd repel each other. So placing them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy.

Wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe their positions are all 2 meters away from P, but their mutual distances can vary. Hmm, but for the potential energy between each pair, I can calculate the energy between each pair.

Wait, but wait, each of the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, which has the 13th charge. The 13th charge is fixed, so the potential due to it would contribute to each of the 12 charges. Also, the 12 charges are each interacting with each other.

So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. Let me break it down.

First, the 13th charge (at P) is fixed, and each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the 13th charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait no, the formula is U = k * (q1 q2)/r. Since each of the 12 is interacting with the 13th, which is fixed, each contributes U_i = k * (2e)*(2e)/(2m). 

So for each of the 12, their potential energy due to the 13th is U_i = k*(2e)^2/(2m). Since there are 12 such interactions, the total from this part is 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] = 12 * [ (k * 2e²) / m ].

Wait, but I should compute that. Let me compute each part step by step.

Wait, no, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the 13th. So each of these 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So the potential energy for each such pair is (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2m) = (k * 4e²)/(2m) = (2k e²)/m. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total is 12*(2k e²/m) = 24 k e² / m.

But wait, is that the only contribution? No, because the 12 charges are also interacting with each other. Each pair among the 12 will contribute to the total potential energy. So I have to calculate that too.

The number of pairs among the 12 charges is C(12,2) = (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs. Each of these pairs has charges 2e each, and the distance between them is... hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't specify their mutual distances. They are each 2m from point P, but their distances from each other could vary. Oh, but when looking for the minimum energy, the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. Because like charges repel, so to minimize the potential energy, they'd want to be as far apart as possible, which would make each pair's potential energy as small as possible (since U is positive for like charges).

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m around P. So their mutual distances can vary, but the minimum potential energy would require them to be as far apart as possible. The most efficient arrangement for that is the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, it's assumed that all mutual distances are the same. Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy, so perhaps each pair is as far apart as possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2m. No, that can't be because if all 12 are at 2m from P, they can't all be 2m from each other unless they are arranged in a planar way which isn't possible for 12 points.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the mutual distances to be 2m as well. But that doesn't seem right because if all the 12 charges were at 2m from P, their mutual distances could be more than 2m if placed on a sphere. Hmm, but without more information, maybe the question assumes that the mutual distances are 2m. Wait, that would be a bad assumption because if you have 12 charges all at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances would be more than 2 meters. For example, two charges on opposite ends of the sphere would be 4 meters apart. But perhaps the problem is making a simplification here, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. If the charges are free to move on the sphere, the minimum potential energy would be achieved when each charge is as far as possible from all others, meaning they arrange themselves as far apart as possible, which would be a configuration with the highest possible symmetry, like points on a regular polyhedron. However, for 12 points on a sphere, the configuration is a bit more complex than, say, the vertices of an icosahedron, but perhaps the problem is considering each mutual distance to be the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and considering that all mutual distances are 2m. But that can't be right because, for example, two charges on the same sphere would be a distance of 2m from P, but their separation would be 2 * sin(theta/2) * 2m, depending on the angle theta between them. The maximum possible separation is 4m (diametrically opposite), but the minimum is close to zero if two charges are very close together on the sphere.

Wait, but for the system's minimum potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible, thereby minimizing each pair's potential energy (since U is positive for like charges, and lower U means lower energy, so more separation reduces U). So the arrangement that gives the maximum possible separation between each pair would minimize the total potential energy.

But how do I compute that? Because the mutual distances vary, but perhaps the problem is not considering that and just taking each mutual distance as 2m, which is the distance from P. That would be incorrect, though, because the mutual distance can't be 2m unless the two charges are on opposite sides of P, but that's only for diametrically opposite points.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are larger than 2m, but I don't know their exact separation. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the interactions between the 12 charges and only calculate the potential energy due to the 13th charge. Wait, but that can't be right because the 12 charges are all moving relative to each other, so their mutual interactions must contribute to the potential energy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intends that the 12 charges are all located at a single point 2m away from P. But that would make their mutual distance zero, which would result in infinite potential energy because U would be (k*(2e)^2)/0, which is undefined. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me read the question again. It says, "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their mutual positions can vary. So their mutual distance can vary between some minimum and maximum. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So the minimum would be when each pair is as far apart as possible, thus minimizing their mutual potential energy (since U is positive, lower U is better for minimum energy).

Wait, but in reality, arranging the 12 charges equally spaced on a sphere would give the minimum potential energy. But I don't know the exact formula for that arrangement. Maybe the problem is simplifying this by assuming that each mutual distance is 2m, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not relevant, perhaps because they're all considered to be at the same point, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges because it's considering the 13th charge as the main contributor. But that would be an oversight because the mutual interactions are significant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances are all the same. But I don't know the exact number. For example, the distance between two points on a sphere of radius r separated by angle θ is 2r sin(θ/2). So if all the 12 charges are equally spaced, the angle between any two adjacent charges would be determined by the number of points. But 12 points on a sphere would form a configuration similar to the vertices of an icosahedron, but I'm not sure of the exact mutual distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a mistake, and the mutual distances are not to be considered, but I don't think so. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. That would make the calculation straightforward, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options and see.

Wait, let me calculate the potential energy due to the 13th charge first. Each of the 12 charges is 2e, so the interaction between each and the 13th is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e² / m. Since there are 12 charges, the total is 12 * 2 k e² / m = 24 k e² / m.

Now, the mutual interactions between the 12 charges: each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j. The problem is that we don't know r_ij, but to find the minimum energy, we need the sum of all (k*(4e²)/r_ij) for all i < j to be as small as possible. Since each term is positive (because all charges are positive), the sum will be minimized when each r_ij is as large as possible. 

But how to compute the sum if we don't know the exact distances? Maybe the problem is considering that the mutual distances are all 2m. If that's the case, then each mutual pair contributes (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e² / m. The number of pairs is C(12,2) = 66. So the mutual contribution would be 66 * 2 k e² / m = 132 k e² / m.

Adding that to the previous 24 k e² / m gives a total of 156 k e² / m.

Wait, but is this a valid assumption? Because having all 12 charges at 2m from P but all at 2m from each other would require them to lie on a regular polyhedron where each edge is 2m. But 12 points can't all be 2m apart on a sphere of radius 2m. Because the maximum distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is 2r, which is 4m in this case. But the mutual distance of 2m would require that each pair is separated by 60 degrees because 2m = 2r sin(theta/2), so sin(theta/2) = 1/2 → theta/2 = 30 degrees → theta = 60 degrees. So 12 points equally spaced on the sphere would each have a separation angle of 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). Wait, no, that's the angle between adjacent points. So the angle between any two points would vary, but perhaps for this problem, the mutual distances are all 2m. Hmm, but I'm not confident about this assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not to be considered, and the problem only accounts for the potential energy between the 12 and the 13th charge. But that doesn't seem right, because the mutual interactions would contribute significantly.

Wait, looking at the answer options, let's see what each would be. Let me compute the value if we only consider the 13th charge's contribution.

Compute 24 k e² / m.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, 1.602×10^-19 C.

m is 2 meters.

Plugging in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

So, 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, 24 k e² / m = 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9.

9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.31e-28 N·m².

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.31e-28 = 5.544e-27.

Divide by 2 m: 5.544e-27 / 2 = 2.772e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, but that's only considering the 13th charge's contribution. If the mutual interactions are also considered, the value would be higher. So if my initial assumption is correct that each mutual pair is at 2m, the total would be 24 + 132 = 156 * (k e²)/(2 m) [Wait no: 24 is 24 * (k*4e²)/(2m) = 24* (2 k e²)/m = 48 k e²/m. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th (fixed) charge.

Each interaction: U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (4 k e²) / (2m) = (2 k e²)/m.

12 interactions: 12 * (2 k e²/m) = 24 k e²/m.

Mutual interactions: Each pair of the 12 charges contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij. If r_ij is 2m for each pair, then each mutual U is (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m. There are 66 pairs, so 66 * 2 k e²/m = 132 k e²/m.

Total U = 24 k e²/m + 132 k e²/m = 156 k e²/m.

So 156 k e²/m. Now plug in the numbers.

Compute 156 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, m is 2 m, so:

Wait, the denominator is m=2, so the formula is 156 * k * e² / 2.

So 156 * k * e² / 2 = (156/2) * k e² = 78 * k e².

Compute 78 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute each part:

(1.602e-19)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38 C².

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute:

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9; 9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 78: 78 * 2.3094e-28 ≈ 1.803e-26 J.

Wait, but wait, 78 * 2.3094e-28 = ?

78 * 2 is 156, 78 * 0.3094e-28 is about 24.08 * 1e-28. So 156e-28 + 24.08e-28 = 180.08e-28 = 1.8008e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J. Close but not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Compute k =8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e=1.602e-19 C.

Compute e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute:

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38

Multiply: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 22.99.

So 22.99 x 10^(9-38) = 22.99e-29 = 2.299e-28.

Multiply by 78 (since we have 78 * k e²):

78 * 2.299e-28 ≈ (70 * 2.299e-28) + (8 * 2.299e-28) ) 

70 * 2.299e-28 = 160.93e-28 = 1.6093e-26.

8 * 2.299e-28 = 1.839e-27.

Adding them together: 1.6093e-26 + 1.839e-27 = 1.7932e-26 J.

Hmm, approximately 1.79e-26 J.

But the options are: option B is 2.822e-26 J, option C is 7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check:

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988 * 2.566 = Let me compute:

8 * 2.566 = 20.528

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.535.

Total ≈20.528 + 2.535 = 23.063.

So 23.063e9 * 1e-38 = 23.063e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

Multiply by 78: 78 * 2.3063e-28 = ?

78 * 2 = 156

78 * 0.3063 = let's compute: 70*0.3063 = 21.441, 8*0.3063=2.4504 → total 23.8914.

So 78 * 2.3063e-28 = 156e-28 + 23.8914e-28 = 179.8914e-28 → 1.798914e-26 J.

So approximately 1.799e-26 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 1.5 times larger than what I've calculated.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are not 2m. Maybe the mutual distance is 4m, which is the maximum possible. But that's only for diametrically opposite points. But in reality, arranging 12 charges on a sphere, their mutual distances wouldn't all be 4m. Only some pairs would. So perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual interactions and only taking the contribution from the 13th charge.

Wait, but then the calculation I did earlier without mutual interactions gives about 2.77e-27 J, which is option C is 7.056e-27 and option B is 2.822e-26. So 2.77e-27 is 0.277e-26, which is 0.277 x 1e-26. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher.

But that doesn't match. So I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try another approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2m away from P. But that can't be, because they would be on top of each other, leading to infinite potential energy. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2m from P but their mutual distances are negligible, but that would imply a very dense arrangement, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, and not the mutual interactions. Let me compute that again.

Each pair between 13th and 12th:

Each U = (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = (4k e²)/(2m) = 2k e² / m.

12 pairs → 24 k e² / m.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, m=2, so denominator is 2.

So 24 * [ (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 ] / 2.

Compute numerator inside:

(8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.063.

So 23.063e(9-38) = 23.063e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3063e-28 = 55.351e-28 = 5.5351e-27.

Divide by 2: 5.5351e-27 / 2 = 2.76755e-27 J.

So about 2.768e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher than this value.

Hmm, but I'm not sure why. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy for the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges is indeed (k * q1 * q2) / r.

But wait, since the 13th charge is fixed, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k * 2e * 2e)/(2m). So that would be (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m per charge. 12 charges → 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but in the mutual interactions, each pair of the 12 charges contributes (k * (2e)^2) / r_ij. But if all the 12 charges are at 2m from P, their mutual distances can vary. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2m, but that's only possible if all 12 charges are at the same point, which is impossible. So perhaps the mutual interactions are being ignored, and the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th and the 12.

In that case, the energy would be 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave about 2.767e-27 J. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger by a factor of about 2.55.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, correct steps:

1. Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

2. Compute (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 = 23.063, so 23.063e(9-38) = 23.063e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

3. Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3063e-28 = 55.351e-28 = 5.5351e-27.

4. Divide by 2 (since m=2): 5.5351e-27 / 2 = 2.7675e-27 J.

So about 2.7675e-27 J. None of the options match exactly. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the initial setup. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the potential energy for the system is the sum of all pairs. So for the 13th charge, each of the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So 12 * (4 k e²)/(2m) → 24 k e²/m.

If I compute 24 k e²/m.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m=2 m.

So,

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute step by step:

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24: 2.306e-28 *24 = 5.534e-27.

Divide by 2: 5.534e-27 /2 = 2.767e-27 J.

So 2.767e-27 J is the potential energy due to the 13th charge.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is almost exactly 2.55 times this value. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 somewhere?

Wait, wait a second. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But wait, when considering the energy of the system, each pair is counted once. So when I added 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), that's correct because each of the 12 charges interacts once with the 13th.

But could there be another factor? For instance, if the 13th charge is fixed, then each interaction is counted once, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again: Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. The 13th is at P, so the distance between each of the 12 and the 13th is 2m. So the potential energy for each pair is (k*(2e)(2e))/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m. 12 pairs → 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but I'm getting about 2.767e-27 J, which is not one of the options. The closest option is B) 2.822e-26, which is about ten times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is considering something else, like gravitational potential energy. But the problem states that the masses are negligible, so gravitational effects are ignored. So it must be electric potential energy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check Coulomb's constant. I used k=8.988e9 N·m²/C², which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for e, like e=1.6e-19 C instead of 1.602. Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19 C.

Compute e²=2.56e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 =8.988 *2.56=23.056, so 23.056e-29=2.3056e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3056e-28=55.3344e-28=5.53344e-27.

Divide by 2: 2.7667e-27 J. Still same as before.

Hmm, none of the options match. Maybe the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the configuration of the 12 charges in a way that their mutual distances are 2m, but that's only possible for a few pairs, not all.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron around the 13th charge. But I'm not familiar with the exact mutual distances in such a configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual interactions and only looks for the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, which is about 2.767e-27 J. But the option closest to that is option C) 7.056e-27 J, which is higher by a factor of about 2.55. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula and forgot to account for something. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the potential energy for a system of charges is the sum of all pairs. So if I have 13 charges, the number of pairs is C(13,2)=78. But no, wait: the 13th is fixed, and the 12 are at 2m. So the total number of pairs is 12 + (12*11)/2 = 12 + 66 = 78. 

Wait a minute, perhaps I forgot to include the mutual interactions earlier. So in the earlier calculation, I considered the mutual interactions, leading to a total of 1.79e-26 J, which is about 1.8e-26 J. But the option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are considered to be zero because the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P but their mutual positions are not contributing to the potential energy, which doesn't make sense because they would still exert forces on each other.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2m from P, so their mutual distance is zero. But that would lead to infinite potential energy, which is impossible. So that can't be.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 J

B) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

C) 7.056 x 10^-27 J

D) 122.330 J

So option D is way too big because it's in J, not 1e-26 J. So it's probably not the correct answer.

If I only calculate the 13th charge's contribution, I get about 2.767e-27 J, which is 0.2767e-26 J. Option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 0.7056e-26 J. Hmm, but that's almost 2.5 times larger than 0.2767e-26 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the 13th contribution carefully.

Compute 24 * k * e² / (2m).

Wait, 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / (2 * 2).

Wait, m=2.

So denominator is 2 * 2 =4.

So 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /4.

Which is (24/4) * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

24/4=6.

6 * 8.988e9 = 53.928e9.

53.928e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute.

53.928e9 =5.3928e10.

5.3928e10 * 2.566e-38 =5.3928 * 2.566e-28.

5.3928 *2.566 ≈ 13.83.

So 13.83e-28 =1.383e-27 J.

Ah! That's about 1.383e-27 J. So none of the options match. So perhaps I did it wrong earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the formula for each pair between the 13th and the 12 charges:

U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (4 k e²) / (2m) = 2 k e²/m.

12 charges → 12 * 2 k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

So when I compute 24 k e²/m, with m=2, it's 24 k e²/(2) = 12 k e².

So 12 * k * e².

Wait, so 12 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

Wait, 8.988e9 *12=107.856e9.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 107.856e9 * 2.566e-38 = 107.856 *2.566e(9-38) = 276.9e-29 = 2.769e-27 J.

Ah, that's where I got 2.767e-27 J earlier.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to assemble the charges. But I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 4 somewhere. Let me think again about the mutual interactions.

If the mutual interactions are considered, each pair of the 12 charges contributes U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

Assuming all mutual distances are 2m, which isn't correct, but let's proceed.

So 66 pairs, each contributing (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

So 66 * 2 k e²/m = 132 k e²/m.

Adding to the 24 k e²/m from the 13th charge, we have 156 k e²/m.

Now, compute 156 * k * e² / m.

m=2.

So 156 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute step by step:

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

k=8.988e9.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 156: 2.306e-28 *156 = 359.136e-28 =3.59136e-26.

Divide by 2: 3.59136e-26 /2 = 1.79568e-26 J.

Hmm, approximately 1.796e-26 J, which is 1.796 x 10^-26 J. The option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is larger than this. So perhaps the mutual distances are not 2m. Or perhaps the problem expects us to consider that each mutual distance is 4m, which is the maximum possible for certain pairs.

But even if mutual distances were 4m, each mutual U would be (4 k e²)/(4m) = k e²/m. Then 66 pairs would contribute 66 k e²/m.

Adding to the 24 k e²/m from the 13th charge gives 90 k e²/m.

Compute 90 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute 90 * k * e² / m.

90 * 8.988e9 = 808.92e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38 gives 808.92e9 *2.566e-38 = 808.92 *2.566e-29 = 2.078e-25.

Divide by 2: 1.039e-25 J, which is way larger than the options. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual interactions, and option C is the right answer. But my calculation for only the 13th charge's contribution gives about 2.767e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem used a different value for e, like 1.6e-19 instead of 1.602, but let's see.

Using e=1.6e-19:

e²=2.56e-38.

Then, for the 13th charge contribution: 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 / 2.

Compute 24 *8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

215.712e9 * 2.56e-38 = 215.712 *2.56e-29 = 553.4e-29 =5.534e-27.

Divide by 2: 5.534e-27 /2= 2.767e-27 J.

Same result as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like U = k Q^2 / r, but I don't think so because each charge is 2e.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as part of the system, but when the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically, the potential energy can be minimized. But I'm not familiar with the exact formula for that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular way, such as on a circle, and the mutual potential energy can be calculated, but I don't have the exact formula.

Given the time I've spent and the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy formula for each pair is (k q^2)/(r), and for n identical charges, the total is (n(n-1)/2) * (k q²)/(r). But in this case, the mutual distances vary, but perhaps the problem assumes each pair is at 2m.

If that's the case, then the mutual contribution is C(12,2) * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So 66 * (4 k e²)/(2m) = 66 * 2 k e²/m = 132 k e²/m.

Adding the 24 k e²/m from the 13th charge, total is 156 k e²/m.

Compute 156 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.306e-28.

156 *2.306e-28= 359.496e-28=3.59496e-26.

Divide by 2: 1.79748e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.797e-26 J. The option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 50% higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for Coulomb's constant. Let me check: Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². Another approximation is 9e9 N m²/C². Let me recompute using k=9e9.

Compute 156 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

9e9 *2.566e-38=2.3094e-28.

156 *2.3094e-28=359.75e-28=3.5975e-26.

Divide by 2: 1.79875e-26 J.

Still not matching option B.

Wait, option B is 2.822e-26 J. Let me see what multiple of 1.79875e-26 would give that. 2.822 / 1.79875 ≈1.57.

So perhaps the mutual distances are smaller, leading to higher potential energy. But why would that be the case for minimum energy?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the mutual distances are 2m. Maybe the problem assumes the mutual distances are all 4m, but that would make the total U even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are the same as the distance from P, which is 2m, but that's not correct because mutual distance can't be 2m unless they are at the same point, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all the charges are arranged in such a way that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P but also 2m from each other. But how many points can you have on a sphere where each pair is exactly 2m apart? Only a few, perhaps. For example, four points (tetrahedron) can be placed on a sphere such that each pair is equidistant, but 12 points can't all be equidistant. So perhaps the problem is making an assumption that each mutual distance is 2m, leading to a higher potential energy.

But without further information, I'm not sure. Given the options, and considering that when mutual interactions are included, the energy is around 1.8e-26 J, which isn't matching any option, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Compute all possible pairs:

Total pairs = 13 charges choose 2 → C(13,2) = 78.

But wait, 13th charge is fixed. So N=13, but the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are moving. So the total number of pairs is 12 (13th with each) + C(12,2) = 12 +66=78.

Each pair contributes U_ij = (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem assumes all r_ij =2m. So each U_ij = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

Total U =78 * 2 k e²/m = 156 k e²/m.

Compute 156 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Which is 156 * (8.988e9 * 2.566e-38) / 2.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.306e-28.

156 *2.306e-28 = 359.3e-28 =3.593e-26.

Divide by 2: 1.7965e-26 J.

Still not matching option B. Hmm.

I think I might have to conclude that the correct answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 4m, but that would result in a higher energy, not lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-19 C instead of 1.602e-19 C. Let me try that.

k=8.988e9, e=1.6e-19.

So e²=2.56e-38.

Compute 156 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 / 2.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38 =2.305e-28.

156 *2.305e-28=359.3e-28=3.593e-26.

Divide by 2: 1.7965e-26 J.

Still same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J, but I can't see where that comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mutual interactions. Maybe the problem expects only the potential energy due to the 13th charge, which is about 2.767e-27 J, which is closest to option C (7.056e-27), but it's about 2.56 times larger.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as fixed, so their mutual positions don't contribute to the potential energy because they're constrained. That is, their mutual distances are fixed, and thus their potential energy isn't considered as part of the system's energy. But that doesn't make sense because they are part of the system and exert forces on each other.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, which is 2.767e-27 J, but the options don't have that. So I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.56 times 2.767e-27 J. But I can't see why there would be such a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I missed a factor of 4 in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, the formula for potential energy is U = (k q1 q2)/r. Each of the 12 charges is 2e, so for each pair with the 13th, it's (k *2e *2e)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

12 charges → 24 k e²/m.

If I forgot to multiply by 24 and instead multiplied by 12, I would get 12 * 2 k e²/m =24 k e²/m. No, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each charge as 4e instead of 2e. But the question states each charge is 2e.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll go with option B) 2.822e-26 J as the closest, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electrostatic potential energy, which arises from two contributions: (1) the interactions between the 13th charge (fixed at point P) and each of the 12 charges at 2 m from P, and (2) the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. The potential energy between two charges is given by:

\[
U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
\]

where \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\), \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the charges, and \(r\) is the distance between them.

### Contribution from the 13th Charge and the 12 Charges
Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge, which is fixed at P. The distance between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge is \(r = 2 \, \text{m}\). The charge of each particle is \(q = 2e\), where \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\). The potential energy for each pair is:

\[
U_{13} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
\]

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution is:

\[
U_{13, \text{total}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
\]

### Contribution from the Interactions Between the 12 Charges
The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are not explicitly given. To minimize the total potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves to maximize the distances between them. However, the problem does not specify the exact configuration of the 12 charges, so it is assumed that each mutual distance is 2 m. The number of pairs among the 12 charges is:

\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \binom{12}{2} = 66
\]

For each pair, the potential energy is:

\[
U_{12} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
\]

The total contribution from the mutual interactions is:

\[
U_{12, \text{total}} = 66 \cdot 2k e^2 = 132k e^2
\]

### Total Potential Energy
The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the contributions from the 13th charge and the mutual interactions:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{13, \text{total}} + U_{12, \text{total}} = 24k e^2 + 132k e^2 = 156k e^2
\]

Substituting the values of \(k\) and \(e\):

\[
k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2, \quad e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}
\]

\[
e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]

\[
k e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.306 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J·m}
\]

\[
U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 2.306 \times 10^{-28} = 3.596 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated total potential energy is approximately \(3.596 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**B) \(2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\)**

This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as the mutual distances of the 12 charges. However, based on the calculations, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
