Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about a star's effective temperature and how it affects the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels.

So, the star has some parameters: a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but how does that 40% coverage affect the overall temperature? I think the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the star's surface, the star's average temperature goes down. But the question is about the photosphere and the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, because the star's photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotted (cooler), the ratio is lower than when it's unspotted (hotter). So the factor is N1/N2 (unspotted) divided by N1/N2 (spotted), which would be the ratio when there are no spots divided by when there are.

I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the transition is at 1448 Å. I'm not sure if that's relevant here, but perhaps it's related to the energy difference between the levels. Because the wavelength corresponds to the energy difference, E = hc/λ. So higher energy is shorter wavelength.

Wait, let me think. The energy difference between level 2 and level 1 can be found from the wavelength of the transition. Since the transition is between these two levels, the photon emitted has energy E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So let's compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters, or 1.448e-7 m.

So E_diff = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Hmm, but we'll need this energy in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (~1.38e-23 J/K) and T is the temperature.

So E_diff/(k T) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T) ) = (1.372e-18)/(1.38e-23 * T) = approx (9.94e4)/T.

Wait, wait: 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 is (1.372/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4. So E_diff/(k T) = (9.94e4)/T.

But wait, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, no, E_diff/(k*T) = (E_diff) / (k*T) = (hc/λ) / (k*T) = (h c) / (λ k T).

Wait, that's another way to write it. So let's compute (h c)/(λ k) in units of (K), because when you divide by T, you get:

( h c ) / ( λ k ) = some value in K, so E_diff/(k T) = (h c)/(λ k T) ) = (h c / (λ k )) * (1/T )

But perhaps it's easier to compute (E_diff)/(k T) for each temperature.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures.

So the ratio when there are no spots (Teff = 6000 K) versus when there are spots (Teff =5500 K).

The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( -(E_diff)/(k T) ). So the ratio when there are no spots (R1) is exp( -E/(k * 6000) ), and when there are spots (R2) it's exp( -E/(k * 5500) ). Wait, but wait, the energy E is E2 - E1. So if E_diff is positive, then when the temperature is lower, the exponent is larger, so the ratio (N1/N2) would decrease.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. So if T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the exponential decreases. So R1/R2 = [exp( -E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because (1/T2 is smaller than 1/T1), so (1/T2 -1/T1) is negative. So the exponent is positive if E is positive. Let me see:

E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) = (E/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

But T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K. So T1 - T2 is 500. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (500) / (T1 T2) )? Wait, wait, T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500. So 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 1.666e-4. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 1.818e-4 -1.666e-4= 1.52e-5.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = approx 1.52e-5 per K.

Now, E is E2 - E1 = hc/(lambda). So let me compute E/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ (hc)/(lambda k) ) ] * (1/T2 -1/T1) 

Wait, but is there a way to compute this in terms of wavelength and temperatures?

Alternatively, using the formula for the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (E_diff) in terms of k*T. Let's compute E_diff = hc/lambda.

Compute hc/lambda:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

hc/lambda = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E_diff/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4 K. So about 9.95e4 K.

So E_diff/(k) is about 99,500 K.

So when we have T1 =6000 K and T2=5500 K.

So the factor is [ (E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].

Wait, so 99,500 K * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ].

Compute that difference: 1/5500 is approx 0.0001818, and 1/6000 is approx 0.00016667. The difference is 0.0000152 ≈ 1.52e-5.

So 99,500 * 1.52e-5 = 99,500 * 1.52e-5.

Let me compute 99,500 * 1.52e-5.

99,500 is 9.95e4. So 9.95e4 * 1.52e-5 = 9.95 *1.52 * 1e-1 = approx 15.094 *0.1 = 1.5094.

So the exponent is positive 1.5094.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive because 1/T2 > 1/T1 since T2 < T1.

Wait, no, 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000, so 1/T2 -1/T1 is positive. So 1.5e-5 is positive.

So the exponent is 99500 *1.52e-5 = 1.5094.

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp(1.5094) ≈ e^1.5094.

What's e^1.5? e is about 2.718, so e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.481.

Wait, but 1.5094 is a bit more than 1.5, so perhaps e^1.5094 is about 4.51 or something.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

We can approximate e^1.5094. Let me use a calculator-like approach. 

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, ln(5)=1.609. So 1.5094 is just a bit higher than 1.504, so e^1.5094 would be a bit higher than 4.5.

Wait, let me compute e^1.5094. If ln(4.5)=1.504077, then 1.5094 is 0.005323 higher. So e^1.5094 ≈ e^{1.504077 + 0.005323} = 4.5 * e^{0.005323}.

e^0.005323 is approximately 1 + 0.005323 + (0.005323)^2/2 ≈ 1.005323 + 0.000014 ≈ 1.005337.

So 4.5 * 1.005337 ≈ 4.5 * 1.0053 ≈ 4.5 + 4.5*0.0053 ≈ 4.5 + 0.02385 ≈ 4.52385.

So around 4.52. So the ratio R1/R2 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait, R1 is the ratio when there are no spots, R2 when there are. So the factor is R1/R2 ≈4.5. So the ratio decreases by a factor of about 4.5 when the star has spots (because R1 is larger than R2). But the question is asking, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has. So that's R1/R2, which we found is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), which can be calculated using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( E_2 - E_1 \)
Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), the energy difference is:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \( E \) to units of \( kT \), where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). The ratio \( \frac{E}{k} \) is:

\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures is:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substitute \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \frac{E}{k} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K} \). Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.666 \times 10^{-4} = 1.52 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(1.52 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.51.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio
The ratio of the Boltzmann factors is:

\[
\exp(1.51) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio \( \frac{N_1}{N_2} \) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.

Wait, but how does that 40% coverage affect the overall temperature? I think the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the star's surface, the star's average temperature goes down. But the question is about the photosphere and the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, because the star's photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotted (cooler), the ratio is lower than when it's unspotted (hotter). So the factor is N1/N2 (unspotted) divided by N1/N2 (spotted), which would be the ratio when there are no spots divided by when there are.

I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the transition is at 1448 Å. I'm not sure if that's relevant here, but perhaps it's related to the energy difference between the levels. Because the wavelength corresponds to the energy difference, E = hc/λ. So higher energy is shorter wavelength.

Wait, let me think. The energy difference between level 2 and level 1 can be found from the wavelength of the transition. Since the transition is between these two levels, the photon emitted has energy E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So let's compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters, or 1.448e-7 m.

So E_diff = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Hmm, but we'll need this energy in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (~1.38e-23 J/K) and T is the temperature.

So E_diff/(k T) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T) ) = (1.372e-18)/(1.38e-23 * T) = approx (9.94e4)/T.

Wait, wait: 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 is (1.372/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4. So E_diff/(k T) = (9.94e4)/T.

But wait, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, no, E_diff/(k*T) = (E_diff) / (k*T) = (hc/λ) / (k*T) = (h c) / (λ k T).

Wait, that's another way to write it. So let's compute (h c)/(λ k) in units of (K), because when you divide by T, you get:

( h c ) / ( λ k ) = some value in K, so E_diff/(k T) = (h c)/(λ k T) ) = (h c / (λ k )) * (1/T )

But perhaps it's easier to compute (E_diff)/(k T) for each temperature.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures.

So the ratio when there are no spots (Teff = 6000 K) versus when there are spots (Teff =5500 K).

The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( -(E_diff)/(k T) ). So the ratio when there are no spots (R1) is exp( -E/(k * 6000) ), and when there are spots (R2) it's exp( -E/(k * 5500) ). Wait, but wait, the energy E is E2 - E1. So if E_diff is positive, then when the temperature is lower, the exponent is larger, so the ratio (N1/N2) would decrease.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. So if T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the exponential decreases. So R1/R2 = [exp( -E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because (1/T2 is smaller than 1/T1), so (1/T2 -1/T1) is negative. So the exponent is positive if E is positive. Let me see:

E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) = (E/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

But T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K. So T1 - T2 is 500. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (500) / (T1 T2) )? Wait, wait, T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500. So 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 1.666e-4. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 1.818e-4 -1.666e-4= 1.52e-5.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = approx 1.52e-5 per K.

Now, E is E2 - E1 = hc/(lambda). So let me compute E/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ (hc)/(lambda k) ) ] * (1/T2 -1/T1) 

Wait, but is there a way to compute this in terms of wavelength and temperatures?

Alternatively, using the formula for the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (E_diff) in terms of k*T. Let's compute E_diff = hc/lambda.

Compute hc/lambda:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

hc/lambda = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E_diff/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4 K. So about 9.95e4 K.

So E_diff/(k) is about 99,500 K.

So when we have T1 =6000 K and T2=5500 K.

So the factor is [ (E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].

Wait, so 99,500 K * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ].

Compute that difference: 1/5500 is approx 0.0001818, and 1/6000 is approx 0.00016667. The difference is 0.0000152 ≈ 1.52e-5.

So 99,500 * 1.52e-5 = 99,500 * 1.52e-5.

Let me compute 99,500 * 1.52e-5.

99,500 is 9.95e4. So 9.95e4 * 1.52e-5 = 9.95 *1.52 * 1e-1 = approx 15.094 *0.1 = 1.5094.

So the exponent is positive 1.5094.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive because 1/T2 > 1/T1 since T2 < T1.

Wait, no, 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000, so 1/T2 -1/T1 is positive. So 1.5e-5 is positive.

So the exponent is 99500 *1.52e-5 = 1.5094.

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp(1.5094) ≈ e^1.5094.

What's e^1.5? e is about 2.718, so e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.481.

Wait, but 1.5094 is a bit more than 1.5, so perhaps e^1.5094 is about 4.51 or something.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

We can approximate e^1.5094. Let me use a calculator-like approach. 

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, ln(5)=1.609. So 1.5094 is just a bit higher than 1.504, so e^1.5094 would be a bit higher than 4.5.

Wait, let me compute e^1.5094. If ln(4.5)=1.504077, then 1.5094 is 0.005323 higher. So e^1.5094 ≈ e^{1.504077 + 0.005323} = 4.5 * e^{0.005323}.

e^0.005323 is approximately 1 + 0.005323 + (0.005323)^2/2 ≈ 1.005323 + 0.000014 ≈ 1.005337.

So 4.5 * 1.005337 ≈ 4.5 * 1.0053 ≈ 4.5 + 4.5*0.0053 ≈ 4.5 + 0.02385 ≈ 4.52385.

So around 4.52. So the ratio R1/R2 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait, R1 is the ratio when there are no spots, R2 when there are. So the factor is R1/R2 ≈4.5. So the ratio decreases by a factor of about 4.5 when the star has spots (because R1 is larger than R2). But the question is asking, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has. So that's R1/R2, which we found is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), which can be calculated using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( E_2 - E_1 \)
Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), the energy difference is:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \( E \) to units of \( kT \), where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). The ratio \( \frac{E}{k} \) is:

\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures is:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substitute \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \frac{E}{k} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K} \). Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.666 \times 10^{-4} = 1.52 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(1.52 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.51.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio
The ratio of the Boltzmann factors is:

\[
\exp(1.51) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio \( \frac{N_1}{N_2} \) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
