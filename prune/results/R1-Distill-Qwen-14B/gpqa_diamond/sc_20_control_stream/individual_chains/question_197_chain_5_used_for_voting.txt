Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and determining the final product. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let me look at the spectral data provided. The IR and NMR data are key here. I'll start by analyzing the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually suggests the presence of an -OH group or maybe an N-H stretch, but since the options don't have amines, I'll think it's an -OH. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, compound X probably has a carbonyl group, an -OH group, and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often corresponds to an -OH proton. So that supports the IR data. 
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents causing splitting. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. Since 8.0 is more downfield than 7.2, maybe it's para-substituted with two substituents, one more electronegative in one position. Wait, but if it's an aromatic ring with substituents, maybe it's a substituted benzene with an ester or a carboxylic acid group? Hmm, but wait, the IR includes a carbonyl. So maybe it's a carbonyl attached to the ring.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. Could it be an ester (around 1730-1750) or a ketone (around 1700-1750)? Wait, wait, 1720 is a bit lower than typical esters. Maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an aromatic ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid? Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but it's usually lower because of hydrogen bonding. But wait, what about an ester? Or maybe a ketone.

Looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak is likely an -OH from a carboxylic acid, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, would that peak be broad? Yes, because -OH in a carboxylic acid is usually broad. Alternatively, an alcohol's -OH is also broad, but in this case, the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch around 3000-3500 except for the 3400-2500 cm-1 region, which might suggest an -OH. Wait, but the 3400–2500 could also be an -NH stretch, but I don't see any amine in the options.

Wait, but I'm confused. If there's a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester. Because a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H around 2500-3400, but the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 is a single peak, maybe it's an O-H stretch. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the NMR. 

The aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because the two doublets each have 2H, that's a typical para-substitution pattern. So, substituents in the para positions. So, the benzene has two substituents, in positions 1 and 4, perhaps. 

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2. Because a triplet suggests two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, so maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, more precisely, the 0.9 ppm (t) suggests a terminal methyl (like CH2CH2CH3), so the group is probably a butyl chain? Let me think. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH(CH3) group, perhaps. Wait, but a doublet for 3H would be a CH3 attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe it's a CH group attached to a CH3. So putting that together, perhaps a CH(CH3) group connected to another CH2 group.

So, let me try to interpret the entire NMR. 

The aromatic region: para-substituted benzene, so 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are two doublets (each 2H), so substituents at positions 1 and 4. 

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group connected to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is maybe two CH2 groups. The 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a chain. Let's think about that.

The 0.9 t (3H) is a CH2CH2CH3. So, maybe the structure is something like CH2CH(CH2CH3) but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching point. Let's think about the chain. The 0.9 is a triplet, so the adjacent group is a CH2. The 1.7 (m,2H) could be two CH2 groups adjacent, perhaps connected to a CH. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH group. So maybe the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let's see: the 0.9 (t) is a CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl group at the end). The 1.4 (d) is a CH(CH3). So the chain might be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group. Hmm, but the integration is 3H for the CH3 in the d, and 3H for the t. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a substituent. Let me draw it out. 

The 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the structure is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) might be the middle CH2. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH that's connected to the aromatic ring. So maybe the structure is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2– something? Wait, maybe the benzene is connected to a CH group which is connected to a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of a sec-butyl group. 

Sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Or wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. 

Wait, butyl groups: 

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3, but attached via the first CH2.

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that can’t be right. Wait, no, iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) connected as a substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think of the structure of iso-butyl. 

Iso-butyl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) where the point of attachment is the central CH. So, the structure is CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branched butyl group. 

Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals again. 

So, the signals at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). Let me try to think of a structure that would produce these signals. 

The 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3. So, the end of the chain is a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH that's adjacent to another group. The 1.7 (2H) is probably a CH2 connected to a CH group. The 2.9 (1H) suggests a CH group attached to another CH2 or something.

Putting it together, maybe the structure is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH(CH3) ?

Wait, I don't think that fits. Maybe it's Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3? Wait, no, that would have a CH2CH2CH3 and a CH3. Wait, perhaps it's Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH(CH3)–? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to a CH that's connected to a CH3.

Wait, let's think of the chain as: 

Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3? 

Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. No, that seems too long.

Alternatively, maybe the chain is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH(CH3)–. But that would require another CH3. Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH(CH(CH3)CH2CH3). Hmm, no, that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2– something. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3). No, that would give a longer chain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of an allylic structure or something else. Let me think about the integration. 

The aromatic protons: 4H in total (2H in each doublet). So the benzene is 1,4-disubstituted. So substituents at positions 1 and 4. Let's say substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4. Or both substituents are the same, like two groups in para positions.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the signals for the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H), which suggests that the two substituents are in para positions and are meta to each other? Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are across from each other. So, for example, if substituent X is at position 1, substituent Y is at position 4. Then, the adjacent protons (ortho to substituent X) would be at higher ppm, and the para position would be substituent Y.

Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other, so all four aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that makes sense.

So, substituents in para positions. The substituents could be two identical groups, or two different groups. But looking at the IR, we have a carbonyl group. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a COOR (ester) or a COOH (carboxylic acid), and the other substituent is a CH2 group or something else.

Wait, but if the carbonyl is part of an ester, then the structure would be something like para-substituted benzene with an ester group and another substituent.

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group attached to the benzene ring, and another substituent.

But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet (1H), which is likely the -OH of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, if that's the case, then the IR's 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have lower carbonyl frequencies because of hydrogen bonding. However, I'm not too sure about the exact values. So perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is an ester, and the -OH is from an alcohol. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but the NMR's 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid's -OH. So maybe it's a benzoic acid with some substituent.

So, the structure would be a para-substituted benzoic acid. So, the substituents are COOH and another group in the para position.

So the other substituent would be whatever is attached to the benzene ring. Let's look at the NMR again for that.

The other substituent's NMR: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). 

Hmm, perhaps it's an alkyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me imagine the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but more likely, perhaps a longer chain with branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? Or maybe a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, perhaps a more likely structure is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but connected to the ring via a CH group.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the possible structures of the substituent. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH2CH3. So, it's like a CH2CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain. The 1.7 (m,2H) is two CH2 groups. The 2.9 (m,1H) is a CH group adjacent to some other groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2– group attached to the benzene. Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene. Wait, but then the NMR would show different signals.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically an iso-butyl group. Because iso-butyl would have a CH(CH2CH3)2 structure. Let me think about the NMR of iso-butyl.

The iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (but in this data, it's 1.7 ppm m, 2H), and a septet for the CH group (but in the data, it's 2.9 ppm, m, 1H). Wait, but the data doesn't show a septet. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the substituent's structure would be CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, if the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2– attached to the benzene. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the branching. The substituent must have a CH group (the 2.9 ppm m, 1H) attached to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H) and a CH3 group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H). Also, a terminal CH2CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). So perhaps the substituent is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2–, but where's the CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH2CH3) connected to a CH3. So, the substituent would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would make it a pentyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group, making it a sec-butyl group. Because sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2– attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Let me clarify the structure of sec-butyl.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2–, but the actual structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2– attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the correct structure of iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the substituent as a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to another CH2CH3 group.

Wait, if the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, that would be a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group. So, the structure would be benzene ring attached to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 and a CH3. So, that would make the substituent a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the substituent is a single group attached to the benzene. So, considering all that, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think about it.

So, the substituent would have the structure -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2–, but that seems too long. Alternatively, it's a CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group. Wait, that would be pentyl, but perhaps it's a butyl group with a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2– group. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: let's think about the reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, or for the cleavage of a nitrile. Alternatively, it can be used in the hydrolysis of an acid chloride, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, more accurately, I think that reaction is used for the conversion of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Or alternatively, for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of an alkyne to a ketone or carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, wait. The reaction of an ester with red phosphorus and HI is typically used to cleave the ester into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to reduce an ester to an acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Let me think.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about this reaction. Let me recall: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. When a nitrile reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it's converted into an amine. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. So, if compound X is an ester, then upon hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid. Let me look at the options. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, looking at these, options C and A are carboxylic acids. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. 

If X is an ester, and upon hydrolysis becomes a carboxylic acid, which is one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile that is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR of X has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If X has a carbonyl group, it's either an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid. But if the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, which typically converts esters into acids. 

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent on the benzene ring. Let's imagine X is a benzene ring with a COOR group (ester) in para position to another substituent, which is an alkyl group. Then, upon hydrolysis, the ester becomes a carboxylic acid, leading to a benzoic acid derivative.

But let me go back to the NMR of X. The substituent on the benzene besides the carbonyl group (if it's an ester or acid) would be an alkyl group, perhaps a butyl group. Because the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is likely from a CH2CH2CH3 group. Also, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group.

So, let's imagine the structure of X is a para-substituted benzene with a COOR group and a substituent R'. The substituent R' is an alkyl group, perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, besides the aromatic protons, there's a CH group (2.9 ppm, m,1H), two CH2 groups (1.7, m,2H), and a CH3 attached to a CH (1.4, d,3H), and a terminal CH2CH2CH3 (0.9, t,3H).

So, perhaps the substituent R' is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2– group? But that would require more than the given signals.

Alternatively, perhaps R' is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me think: the substituent would be something like CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. 

Wait, but the structure would be something like:

Ph–COOR and Ph–R', where R' is a substituent with the given NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl ester, like para-substituted benzene with a COOR group and another substituent R'.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to reconstruct the structure. 

The NMR shows an aromatic ring with substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (COOR, if it's an ester) or COOH (if it's a carboxylic acid). The other substituent is an alkyl group, perhaps a butyl group.

The substituent's NMR suggests a chain with a terminal CH2CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet), a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m), and a CH3 attached to a CH (1.4 ppm, d).

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent R' is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2– group. But wait, that would require four carbons. Let me think: 

The substituent is –CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2– ?

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2– group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, that would have a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d) attached to a CH group (2.9, m), then a CH2 group (1.7, m), and a terminal CH2CH2CH3 (0.9, t). So the structure would be:

Ph–CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group with a branch. So the substituent is a pentyl group where the third carbon is a branch point. Let me imagine the structure as:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. No, that's a hexyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3. But then, the CH2CH3 would be at the end. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, it's a iso-pentyl group? Or perhaps a iso-butyl group.

Let me think: an iso-butyl group has the structure -CH2CH(CH3)CH2–. But if that's the case, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH3 (0.9 ppm), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (but in the data, it's 1.7 ppm, which is a multiplet), and a septet for the CH group. But the data doesn't show a septet; instead, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent isn't a straight iso-butyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group would be –CH(CH2CH3)CH2–. So, the structure would be Ph–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. No, that's not right. Wait, actually, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2–. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look up the structure of a sec-butyl group. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that iso-butyl is -(CH2)C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary substituent. Sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2–, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl substituent on the second carbon. So, the structure would be Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2–, but I'm not certain.

Putting all this together, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. But I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, for each option, what would the structure look like, and what would the reaction produce?

The question is about the product when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, which of these options is the product?

If X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So, looking at the options, options C and A are carboxylic acids.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid attached to a benzene ring, which itself is substituted at the 4-position with an ethyl group. Not sure.

If X is an ester, then the product upon hydrolysis would be a carboxylic acid. So, if X is, say, the ester form of option C, then upon hydrolysis, it would become option C.

But wait, what's the structure of X? Let me think. If X is an ester, then its structure would be benzoyl ester with a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but that's less likely given the IR data.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with an ester (about 1720-1750 cm-1 for esters). The 10.5 ppm peak in NMR is a broad singlet, which suggests an -OH group, but in an ester, the OH would be part of the alcohol, not the acid. Unless X is a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then why would there be an -OH peak in the NMR? That doesn't make much sense. So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid. Then the IR at 1720 would be a bit low for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700 cm-1. But maybe it's conjugated, so it's lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR at 3400-2500 is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. But the broad peak in the NMR is at 10.5 ppm, which fits a carboxylic acid's -OH.

So, if X is a carboxylic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't make sense, because carboxylic acids don't typically react with HI under those conditions. Unless it's a nitrile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Let's think again: the reaction conditions are with red phosphorus and HI. I think that's the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or perhaps it's used to cleave esters into acids.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the reaction, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that X is a phenyl ester, then upon hydrolysis, it becomes a benzoic acid. So the product would be a benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group in position 1 and a sec-butyl group in position 4.

If X is the ester of this, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl ester of some acid. But then, the NMR of X would show the ester's OCH2 or something else, which I don't see in the data. So perhaps X is the benzoic acid, and the reaction isn't hydrolysis.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to reconstruct the structure based on the NMR.

The substituent on the benzene is a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), which is connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which is connected to a CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and the end is a CH2CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

So the substituent is a chain like CH–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2CH2CH3? No, the substituent would be attached to the benzene. So perhaps it's a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let me imagine the structure as:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH(CH3)–.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, like –CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2–.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be Ph–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–.

Wait, no, because the substituent would need to connect to the benzene. Let me think of the substituent as:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3 ?

No, that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the structure would be Ph–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. No, that's a hexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group, which would make it a tertiary butyl group? No, that would be -C(CH2CH2CH3)3.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the substituent as a butyl group. The NMR suggests a chain of four carbons: CH–CH2–CH2–CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the structure would be Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3). But that would only account for the CH and the CH2CH2CH3 group. But the NMR also shows a CH2 group at 1.7 ppm and a CH3 at 1.4 ppm. So perhaps the substituent has more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3) group.

So, the substituent would be Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH2CH3.

But that doesn't fit the NMR because the CH2 groups would have different shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So, the substituent would be Ph–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3. But that would be a butyl group.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let's try to think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is:

Benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group (–CH2CH(CH3)CH2–) at position 4.

If X is the ester of this benzoic acid, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl ester of some acid. But the NMR of X would have the ester's OCH2 group, which I don't see in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is the benzoic acid itself, and the reaction is something else. But then, why would it react with red phosphorus and HI?

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But then, X would be a nitrile, and the product would be the acid.

Wait, but the IR data doesn't show a nitrile peak (around 2200 cm-1). The IR data given doesn't include such a peak, so X is unlikely to be a nitrile.

Another possibility: X is an alkyne. The IR doesn't show the C≡C stretch (around 3300 cm-1, but that's in the 3400–2500 region, which is already covered). So perhaps X is an alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride. But the IR would show a peak around 1800 cm-1, which isn't mentioned. So that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So X has a benzene ring.

Putting all this together, I think X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that is an iso-butyl group or a sec-butyl group.

So, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would fit if X is this compound. But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which, if X is a benzoic acid, I'm unsure what reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. So, if X is the ester, then the product is the acid.

But without knowing the exact structure of X, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, so X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Looking at the options, options C and A are acids. So the product would be either of them.

Now, let's think about the substituent. The substituent on the benzene is a butyl group. So in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. 

In the NMR of X, the substituent would have the signals we have. So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (but in our data, it's 1.7 ppm, m, 2H), and a septet for the CH group. But in the given data, the CH is at 2.9 ppm, m, 1H, which doesn't fit a septet.

Hmm, but maybe the substituent isn't a simple iso- or sec-butyl group. Maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the product after reaction is one of the options. Let me consider each option.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, after reaction, the product has a sec-butyl group and a COOH group in para positions.

If X was the ester, then the product would be this. So X would be 4-(sec-butyl) phenyl ester of some acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But without a nitrile peak in IR, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bromide or chloride, and the reaction is a substitution, but I don't have enough data.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but that's unrelated.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to make a conclusion based on the options and the data.

The IR suggests a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), an O-H (3400–2500), and aromatic C=C. The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene, a carboxylic acid (broad peak at 10.5 ppm), and a substituent that is an alkyl group with a chain.

The substituent's NMR suggests a CH group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a CH2CH3.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. So the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the reaction converts X into this acid. But what is X? If X is an ester, then the reaction is hydrolysis to produce the acid.

Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would produce the amine, but that's not an option.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI, which are used in the hydrolysis of esters to acids. So, if X is an ester, then the product would be the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent. So, if X is the ester, then option C would be the product.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The spectral data provided includes IR and 1H NMR, which are analyzed to deduce the structure of X and the reaction outcome.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group or possibly an aromatic C-H stretch.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for a CH group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for a CH2 group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for a CH3 group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a terminal CH3 group, likely part of an alkyl chain.

3. **Reaction Conditions**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids or the conversion of nitriles to amines. Given the IR and NMR data, the reaction is interpreted as the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

4. **Structural Interpretation**:
   - The para-substituted benzene indicates two substituents in the 1 and 4 positions.
   - The IR and NMR data suggest one substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other is an alkyl group.
   - The alkyl group's NMR signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) correspond to a sec-butyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)).

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as it does not match the para-substitution pattern or the alkyl group structure.
   - **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the reaction conditions.
   - **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct. This compound has a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at position 1 and a sec-butyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)) at position 4, consistent with the spectral data.
   - **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the reaction conditions.

### Conclusion:
Compound X is likely an ester that reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches the spectral data and reaction conditions.
