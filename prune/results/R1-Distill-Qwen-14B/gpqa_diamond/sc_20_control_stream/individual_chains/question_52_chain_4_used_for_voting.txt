Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a star's properties when it has and doesn't have dark spots on its surface. Hmm, I remember that stars can have sunspots, which are darker and cooler regions. When a star has spots, it affects its overall brightness and temperature.

The star in question has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that seems a big jump. Or maybe not—since spots are cooler, the overall effective temperature would decrease, right.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of titanium (Ti) in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes between when there are no spots and when there are spots.

So, I think I need to use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio they're talking about is n2/n1. When the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so the ratio changes. Let me think about how the ratio changes with temperature.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So the ratio is lower at lower temperatures. That makes sense because higher energy levels are less populated when the temperature is lower. So, as the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 should decrease.

The transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet range. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the exact wavelength isn't needed directly. Because the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength, via the relation E = hc/λ.

Right, so the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But wait, I'll need to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors when the temperature is T1 (6000 K) versus T2 (5500 K). Because the star's temperature when it has spots is lower, the ratio will change.

So, the ratio when no spots (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

And when there are spots, (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that would mean (n2/n1)_2 is less than (n2/n1)_1. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_1 / (n2/n1)_2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ]

Simplifying that, the exponential terms subtract in the exponents. So:

exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute ΔE using the wavelength. The wavelength λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So, E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Calculating that:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, that's per photon. But per mole or per molecule? No, because we're dealing with individual atoms. But for the Boltzmann factor, we need the energy difference in terms of per molecule, so this is correct.

But I need the energy in terms of J per atom, which E is.

But since k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K, and T is in K.

So let me compute (ΔE)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approx (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 = about 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99500, yes, so ~9.95e4 K.

So X = (ΔE/(k)) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) where T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

So, 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4.

So 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

Then, X * (1/T2 -1/T1) = 9.95e4 * 1.513e-5.

Let's compute 9.95e4 * 1.513e-5.

9.95e4 is 99500, 1.513e-5 is 0.00001513.

Multiply: 99500 * 0.00001513 = let's compute 100,000 * 0.00001513 = 1.513, but 99500 is 500 less, so 1.513 minus (500 * 0.00001513 )= 1.513 - 0.007565 ≈ 1.5054.

So the exponent is about 1.5054.

So, the ratio factor is exp(1.5054) ≈ e^1.5054.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So e^1.5 is approx 4.4817.

But let me calculate more accurately.

1.5054 is 1.5 + 0.0054.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.0054 ≈ 1 + 0.0054 + 0.0054^2/2 ≈ 1.005428.

So e^1.5054 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.005428 ≈ approx 4.4817 * 1.005 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0224 ≈ 4.504.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the factor by which the ratio changes (when no spots / when spots) is about 4.5.

Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So C is 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the temperatures. Because the ratio when there are spots is lower. So the ratio when no spots (Teff=6000 K) is higher than when there are spots (5500 K). So the ratio of (no spots ratio)/(spot ratio) is about 4.5.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the factor is about 4.5, so the answer is C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant. The ratio of the populations changes due to the temperature difference between the two cases.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \) from the wavelength
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature difference term
For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), compute:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.513 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = (9.95 \times 10^4)(1.513 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.5054.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the ratio factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)\right) = \exp(1.5054).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.5) \approx 4.4817 \) and \( \exp(0.0054) \approx 1.0054 \), we find:

\[
\exp(1.5054) \approx 4.4817 \times 1.0054 \approx 4.504.
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which the ratio changes (no spots / spots) is approximately 4.5. This matches option C.

I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes between when there are no spots and when there are spots.

So, I think I need to use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio they're talking about is n2/n1. When the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so the ratio changes. Let me think about how the ratio changes with temperature.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So the ratio is lower at lower temperatures. That makes sense because higher energy levels are less populated when the temperature is lower. So, as the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 should decrease.

The transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet range. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the exact wavelength isn't needed directly. Because the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength, via the relation E = hc/λ.

Right, so the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But wait, I'll need to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors when the temperature is T1 (6000 K) versus T2 (5500 K). Because the star's temperature when it has spots is lower, the ratio will change.

So, the ratio when no spots (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

And when there are spots, (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that would mean (n2/n1)_2 is less than (n2/n1)_1. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_1 / (n2/n1)_2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ]

Simplifying that, the exponential terms subtract in the exponents. So:

exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute ΔE using the wavelength. The wavelength λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So, E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Calculating that:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, that's per photon. But per mole or per molecule? No, because we're dealing with individual atoms. But for the Boltzmann factor, we need the energy difference in terms of per molecule, so this is correct.

But I need the energy in terms of J per atom, which E is.

But since k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K, and T is in K.

So let me compute (ΔE)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approx (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 = about 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99500, yes, so ~9.95e4 K.

So X = (ΔE/(k)) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) where T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

So, 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4.

So 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

Then, X * (1/T2 -1/T1) = 9.95e4 * 1.513e-5.

Let's compute 9.95e4 * 1.513e-5.

9.95e4 is 99500, 1.513e-5 is 0.00001513.

Multiply: 99500 * 0.00001513 = let's compute 100,000 * 0.00001513 = 1.513, but 99500 is 500 less, so 1.513 minus (500 * 0.00001513 )= 1.513 - 0.007565 ≈ 1.5054.

So the exponent is about 1.5054.

So, the ratio factor is exp(1.5054) ≈ e^1.5054.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So e^1.5 is approx 4.4817.

But let me calculate more accurately.

1.5054 is 1.5 + 0.0054.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.0054 ≈ 1 + 0.0054 + 0.0054^2/2 ≈ 1.005428.

So e^1.5054 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.005428 ≈ approx 4.4817 * 1.005 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0224 ≈ 4.504.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the factor by which the ratio changes (when no spots / when spots) is about 4.5.

Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So C is 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the temperatures. Because the ratio when there are spots is lower. So the ratio when no spots (Teff=6000 K) is higher than when there are spots (5500 K). So the ratio of (no spots ratio)/(spot ratio) is about 4.5.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the factor is about 4.5, so the answer is C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant. The ratio of the populations changes due to the temperature difference between the two cases.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \) from the wavelength
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature difference term
For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), compute:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.513 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = (9.95 \times 10^4)(1.513 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.5054.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the ratio factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)\right) = \exp(1.5054).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.5) \approx 4.4817 \) and \( \exp(0.0054) \approx 1.0054 \), we find:

\[
\exp(1.5054) \approx 4.4817 \times 1.0054 \approx 4.504.
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which the ratio changes (no spots / spots) is approximately 4.5. This matches option C.

Answer: C
