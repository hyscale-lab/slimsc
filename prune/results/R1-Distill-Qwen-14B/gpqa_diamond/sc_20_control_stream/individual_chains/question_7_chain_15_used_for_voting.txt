Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is about finding the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I remember something about pair production and photon interactions. The process in question is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. I think this is a reaction where two photons collide and produce a pair of electrons and positrons.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited by this process, which probably means that the probability of this annihilation happening is so high that the gamma-rays can't exist for longer than a certain time. So the lifetime is determined by the interaction rate with the CMB photons.

I think the key here is to calculate the mean free time for this process. The mean free time τ is the average time between two successive interactions. The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited by this τ, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction rate Γ, where τ ≈ 1/Γ.

The interaction rate Γ would depend on the cross-section σ for the reaction, and the number density of the target photons (the CMB photons in this case). So Γ = σ * n_γ * v, where v is the relative velocity of the photons. Wait, but in the early universe, the CMB photons are isotropic and the gamma-ray is moving in some direction. Hmm, but for high-energy gamma-rays, perhaps we can consider a certain frame where the motion is such that the photon density is boosted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the formula. The cross-section for two-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by the so-called photon-photon cross-section. I think the cross-section σ for γγ→e+e- is approximately σ ~ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (1/( (E1 E2) )) ), where E1 and E2 are the photon energies, and α is the fine-structure constant. Or wait, maybe it's a function that depends on the center-of-mass energy.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for this process peaks when the center-of-mass energy is around 2m_e c^2, which is about 1 MeV. But in this case, the gamma-ray and CMB photon would need to have enough energy to produce the pair.

Wait, the CMB photon has energy E_photon ≈ 1e-3 eV, and the gamma-ray has energy E_gamma. The threshold for producing an electron-positron pair is when the total center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. So for the process γ + γ → e+ e-, the condition is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c^2.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the CMB photons have a low energy. So the gamma-ray must have enough energy so that when it collides with a CMB photon, the combined energy is sufficient for pair production.

Wait, the center-of-mass energy squared s is given by s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c - p_photon c)^2, since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision, which gives the maximum possible s).

Wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are opposite. So the total energy is E_gamma + E_photon, and the total momentum is (E_gamma - E_photon)/c, since one is moving in the positive direction and the other negative. So s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_gamma - E_photon)/c )^2 c^2.

Simplifying this, s = [E_gamma + E_photon]^2 - [E_gamma - E_photon]^2 = (E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2) - (E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2) ) = 4 E_gamma E_photon.

So s = 4 E_gamma E_photon. For pair production, we need s ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E_gamma E_photon ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E_gamma ≥ (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E_photon) ) → E_gamma ≥ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_photon).

Wait, let me compute that.

Given E_photon = 1e-3 eV, m_e c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So m_e c^2 = 511,000 eV, so (m_e c^2)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2.

So E_gamma ≥ (511,000^2 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) ) = (511e3)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Let me compute that.

511e3 is 5.11e5 eV. Squared is (5.11e5)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV^2.

Divided by 1e-3 eV gives 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 261,000 GeV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV (because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV).

Looking at the options:

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which is 260,000 GeV. So that's looking promising.

But wait, wait a minute. Did I do the calculation correctly? Let me double-check.

E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 (eV^2) → 26.1121 * 1e10 eV^2 = 2.61121e11 eV^2.

E_photon is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma = (2.61121e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV, which is approximately 2.6e5 GeV. That's option C.

But wait, the initial question is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So when the gamma-ray's energy is above this threshold, the annihilation becomes possible, and thus their lifetime is limited by this interaction.

So the calculation seems to point to option C as the correct answer.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The center-of-mass energy squared, $s$, for the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\gamma$) with a CMB photon ($E_{\text{CMB}}$) is given by:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

For pair production to occur, the center-of-mass energy must satisfy:

\[
s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$ is the rest energy of the electron. Substituting $s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$ into the threshold condition, we find:

\[
4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, we get:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

Given $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ and $m_e c^2 = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$, we calculate:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, compute $(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2$:

\[
(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2 = (5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2 = 2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Dividing by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This result corresponds to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

This is the energy threshold above which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons.

So s = 4 E_gamma E_photon. For pair production, we need s ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E_gamma E_photon ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E_gamma ≥ (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E_photon) ) → E_gamma ≥ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_photon).

Wait, let me compute that.

Given E_photon = 1e-3 eV, m_e c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So m_e c^2 = 511,000 eV, so (m_e c^2)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2.

So E_gamma ≥ (511,000^2 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) ) = (511e3)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Let me compute that.

511e3 is 5.11e5 eV. Squared is (5.11e5)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV^2.

Divided by 1e-3 eV gives 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 (eV^2) → 26.1121 * 1e10 eV^2 = 2.61121e11 eV^2.

E_photon is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma = (2.61121e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV, which is approximately 2.6e5 GeV. That's option C.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The center-of-mass energy squared, $s$, for the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\gamma$) with a CMB photon ($E_{\text{CMB}}$) is given by:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

For pair production to occur, the center-of-mass energy must satisfy:

\[
s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$ is the rest energy of the electron. Substituting $s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$ into the threshold condition, we find:

\[
4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, we get:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

Given $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ and $m_e c^2 = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$, we calculate:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, compute $(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2$:

\[
(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2 = (5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2 = 2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Dividing by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This result corresponds to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

This is the energy threshold above which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons.
