Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to understand what's going on.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through several tubes without cooling first.

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube №1), then a Ca(OH)2 solution (tube №2), and then red-hot copper (tube №3). The results are that tube №1 and №3 gained 3.60 grams and 0.80 grams, respectively. Tube №2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let me think about what each of these tubes does. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent and can react with water, maybe. Or wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a desiccant and can absorb water of crystallization. But in this case, maybe it's absorbing water from the gases.

Tube №1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. So the gases pass through it, and the weight increased by 3.60g. This suggests that Mg(ClO4)2 absorbed some water vapor. Because when Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which increases the mass. So the increase in mass is the mass of water absorbed.

So, the mass increase in tube 1 is 3.60g, which equals the mass of H2O. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g / (18 g/mol) = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O are in the gas mixture.

Tube №3 is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper exposed to gases can react with certain gases. Common reactions are with CO2, H2S, SO3, etc. Wait, but the problem states that CuO was formed. So the gas must have contained a substance that reacts with copper to form CuO. What gases would do that? CO (carbon monoxide) reacts with CuO to form CO2 and Cu, but wait, in the presence of heat, maybe the reverse happens. Alternatively, maybe CO reacts with CuO at high temperatures, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's H2S. H2S would react with hot CuO to form CuS, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, but that might not react with CuO. Or perhaps the gas is SO2 or another sulfur compound.

Wait, another possibility: when a gas like H2S passes over hot copper, it might not react. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with CO2. But CO2 doesn't react with CuO under normal conditions unless there's a catalyst. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the gas is H2O vapor, but that doesn't seem right because water vapor would have been absorbed in tube 1.

Wait, but the problem says that in tube 3, the weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. That suggests that the gas that passed through caused Cu to react and form CuO. So the reaction is probably 2 Cu + O2 -> 2 CuO. But wait, that would require O2, but O2 might not be present. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO. Wait, CO would react with CuO as follows: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. But since the tube was red-hot, maybe this reaction occurs. But how would that affect the mass?

Wait, if the gas is CO, then in tube 3, the CO would react with CuO (if any) to produce Cu and CO2. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2S, which could react with CuO as follows: H2S + CuO → CuS + H2O. But I'm not certain about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a sulfur-containing oxide like SO2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O, but in that case, the Mg(ClO4)2 would have absorbed all of it earlier in tube 1. So perhaps the gas that reacts in tube 3 is CO2. But as I thought earlier, CO2 doesn't react with CuO unless there's a catalyst.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider what each tube captures. Tube 1 captures water, so the gas has H2O. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the tube's weight didn't change, that suggests that CO2 wasn't present. Because if there were CO2, tube 2 would have gained mass. But in this case, tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps there was no CO2 in the gas.

Wait, but what if the gas was SO2? Because SO2 is a gas that could pass through, and if it passed through tube 2, which is a solution of Ca(OH)2, it would react. The reaction is SO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaSO3 + H2O. So if SO2 was present, tube 2 would have gained mass. But since the weight didn't change, that suggests no SO2 in the gas. So, the gas that passed through tube 2 didn't react with Ca(OH)2, meaning no CO2, no SO2, no H2S (since H2S would react with Ca(OH)2: H2S + Ca(OH)2 → CaS + 2 H2O). So, the gas passed through tube 2 without reacting, meaning the gas must have been something like H2, N2, O2, or maybe something else inert under these conditions.

Wait, but the problem states that after passing through all the tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas is 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

But what is gas C? Let's think. The gas that didn't react in the last tube must be something that isn't reactive here. Let's think about the gases that are possible.

So, the initial heating of salts A and B produced a mixture of gases. Let me think of what these could be. Salts when heated can decompose to produce various gases. For example, nitrates decompose to form NO2, or KNO3 might produce KNO2, O2, etc. Or sulfites decompose to SO2 and CO2. Or carbonates decompose to CO2 and something else. But since the initial salts are equimolar, perhaps they're a mixture that upon heating gives off a combination of gases.

Wait, but the problem says that the mixture of salts upon heating gives a mixture of gases. The gases are passed through these tubes. Let's think step by step.

First, the gas mixture is passed through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2). The weight increased by 3.60g, which we think is H2O. So the gases must have contained H2O vapor.

Then, the gas passes through tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution). The weight didn't change, so whatever was in the gas didn't react with the solution. So the gas didn't have CO2 or SO2, as these would have reacted. So perhaps the remaining gas after this step is something inert, like O2 or N2, but more likely a gas that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution.

But wait, another possibility: the gas could have been H2. H2 doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution, I think. Because H2 would have to bubble through it, and unless there's a catalyst, it wouldn't react. Similarly, O2 wouldn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3, but NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form Ca(NH2)2 or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, but NH3 is a base, so it would react with Ca(OH)2. So if the gas had NH3, then tube 2 would have reacted, but since the weight didn't change, NH3 isn't present.

So, the gas that's left after tube 2 must be something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution. Let's think about the possible gases: H2, O2, N2, maybe CO (but I'm not sure if CO would react with Ca(OH)2). Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else.

Then, the gas goes through tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So the gas must have contained something that reacts with copper upon heating to form CuO. Let's think about possible gases.

CO is a possibility. When CO reacts with CuO, it forms Cu and CO2. Let me write the reaction:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

But what would be the mass change in tube 3 for this reaction? Let's calculate.

Suppose we have x moles of CO reacting. The reaction consumes x moles of CO and produces x moles of CO2. The mass of CO is 28g/mol * x, and CO2 is 44g/mol *x. But in the reaction, the mass change would be: the mass of the product (CO2) minus the mass of the reactant (CO). So for each mole, the mass increases by 16g/mol (44 - 28 = 16). So if the mass increase is 0.80g, then x = 0.80g /16g/mol = 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 moles of CO would react, producing 0.05 moles of CO2. But wait, the gas after tube 3 is the gas that didn't react, and it's 2.24 L, which is 0.1 mol. So perhaps the initial gas mixture had 0.1 mol of CO, which all reacted in tube 3, but that doesn't add up because the reaction would produce CO2, which is a gas, so it would contribute to the final volume.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's see: the gas that passed through all the tubes and ended up as gas C is 0.1 moles. Let's think about what this could be.

So, the gases after tube 3 are 0.1 moles. So possible gas C could be O2, N2, or perhaps another inert gas. Alternatively, maybe it's H2, but H2 wouldn't react with CuO unless in specific conditions.

Wait, but the initial gases after tube 1 and 2 would have some gases left. Let me think about what remains after each step.

After tube 1, the H2O is absorbed. So the remaining gases are those that don't react with Mg(ClO4)2. Then, in tube 2, any CO2 or SO2 would have been absorbed if present, but since the weight didn't change, perhaps the gas doesn't contain those. So what's left is something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like H2, O2, N2, etc.

Then, in tube 3, any gas that reacts with Cu would be consumed, leaving only the inert gas. So, for example, if the gas after tube 2 was CO and H2, then CO would react in tube 3, but H2 might not. Alternatively, perhaps it's O2, which wouldn't react with CuO unless in presence of a catalyst.

Wait, but the problem says that CuO was formed in tube 3. So the reaction must have involved the gas in tube 3 reacting with Cu to form CuO. Let's think about what gas would do that.

If the gas is O2, then O2 would react with hot Cu to form CuO: 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. In this case, each mole of O2 would produce 2 moles of CuO. The mass increase would be the mass of O in O2. So for each mole of O2, mass increase is 32g (since O2 is 32g/mol, and CuO is 80g/mol per mole, but the molar mass change is 80g/mol for 2 moles of CuO, but perhaps this is getting complicated.

Wait, another way: Suppose the gas was O2. Then, 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. For each mole of O2, the mass of CuO formed is 2*(80) = 160g. The mass of O2 is 32g. So the mass increase would be 160 - 32 = 128g per mole of O2. But in our case, the mass increase is 0.80g. So 0.80g = 128g/mol * x → x = 0.80/128 = 0.00625 mol. So if it was O2, then 0.00625 moles. But gas C would then be the remaining gas after this reaction.

Wait, but the residual gas after tube 3 is 0.1 moles. So let's calculate the total moles before and after.

Wait, the initial gas after tube 2 must have some moles, and then in tube 3, some reacts, leaving 0.1 moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas in tube 3 is H2S. Let me think. H2S reacting with Cu would produce CuS and H2. The reaction is H2S + Cu → CuS + H2. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑. But I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe H2S reacts with CuO: H2S + CuO → CuS + H2O. But in that case, the mass gain would be from the H2S. H2S has a molar mass of 34g/mol. If 0.05 moles of H2S (since 0.05 *34=1.7g) reacted, but the mass increase is 0.80g, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2. SO2 would react with Cu: 2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO3 + O2. Wait, no, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where SO2 reacts with CuO: SO2 + CuO → CuSO3. Hmm.

Let me step back. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. So, the reaction must involve the gas reacting with Cu to form CuO, and the mass increase is the mass of O added. Let me think of the reaction where a gas provides O to form CuO.

For example, if the gas is CO, the reaction is CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. The molar mass of CO is 28g/mol, and CO2 is 44g/mol. So for each mole of CO, the system gains 44 - 28 = 16g. So, if the mass increase is 0.80g, then moles of CO would be 0.80 / 16 = 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 moles of CO reacted. Let's check what that would mean. The gas after tube 3 would be the unreacted CO, but wait, no, the reaction consumes CO and produces CO2. So, if we started with x moles of CO, and y moles reacted, then the remaining CO would be (x - y), but actually, the reaction produces CO2, which would be a different gas. But in the problem, the final gas is gas C, which is 0.1 moles, so perhaps gas C is CO2.

Wait, but in the problem, the gas that remains is 2.24 L, which is 0.1 moles. Let me think again.

So, initial gas mixture after tube 2: Let's say we have CO and H2. Then, in tube 3, CO reacts with CuO to form CO2 and Cu. The reaction is:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

This reaction consumes CO and produces CO2. The mass increase in tube 3 would be the mass of CO2 minus the mass of CO. So for each mole, the mass increases by 16g (44 - 28 = 16). So 0.80g increase corresponds to 0.80 /16 = 0.05 moles of CO reacted.

So, if 0.05 moles of CO reacted, then the moles of CO consumed is 0.05, and moles of CO2 produced is 0.05.

Now, what's the setup? The initial mixture of salts A and B, upon heating, produces H2O, CO, and H2 perhaps. Then, when passed through the tubes:

- Tube 1: H2O is absorbed, 0.2 moles (3.6g/18g/mol).
- Tube 2: Doesn't react, so no CO2, SO2, etc. So perhaps the remaining gases are H2 and CO.
- Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CO2 and increase mass by 0.80g (0.05 moles CO reacted), leaving H2 as gas C.

Wait, but H2 is a possibility for gas C. Let's see. If the initial gas after tube 2 was H2 and CO, then in tube 3, CO would react, leaving H2. The moles of H2 would be the initial amount minus any that reacted. Wait, but H2 doesn't react with CuO unless in specific conditions, like with a catalyst.

Wait, but in the problem, the final gas is 0.1 moles, which would correspond to H2 if that's gas C. Let me think about the total moles.

Wait, let's try to outline all the steps:

1. Heated salts A and B produce gases: H2O, CO, and H2.

2. Pass through Mg(ClO4)2: H2O absorbed (0.2 moles), so the remaining gas is CO and H2.

3. Pass through Ca(OH)2 solution: No reaction, so CO and H2 remain.

4. Pass through red-hot Cu: CO reacts, producing CO2. The mass increase is 0.80g, which is 0.05 moles CO. So, from CO, 0.05 moles reacted, producing 0.05 moles CO2.

Now, the gas after tube 3 would be the unreacted CO plus any H2.

But wait, the initial gas after tube 2 would contain CO and H2. Let's say the initial moles of CO and H2 after tube 2 are a and b, respectively.

In tube 3, CO reacts. Let's say all of the CO reacts, but that's not possible because the mass increase is 0.80g, which is 0.05 moles. So, initial CO moles = x, and after reaction, some remains if x > 0.05.

Wait, but the problem says that after all, only gas C remains, which is 0.1 moles. So perhaps all the CO reacted, and the remaining gas is H2.

So, let's model this.

Let me denote:

After tube 1: the gas has only CO and H2, because H2O is absorbed.

After tube 2: same, because no reaction.

In tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CO2, and H2 remains.

The mass increase in tube 3 comes from the CO reacting. So, the moles of CO reacted is 0.05 mol.

So, initial moles of CO after tube 2 was 0.05 mol. So, after reaction, CO is 0, and CO2 is 0.05 mol. But wait, the problem says that CuO was formed, which suggests that the reaction is between CO and CuO. So, perhaps the Cu is in the form of CuO, and the reaction is CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

In this reaction, for each mole of CO, 1 mole of CO2 is produced, and the mass change is 16g/mol (as CO2 is 44g, CO is 28g, so 16g increase per mole).

So, 0.80g increase means 0.05 moles of CO reacted, producing 0.05 moles of CO2.

But what about the H2? H2 doesn't react with CuO unless under specific conditions, which might not be the case here. So, the H2 would pass through without reacting, and the CO would be consumed, leaving H2 as gas C.

But wait, the problem says that after all the tubes, 2.24 L (0.1 moles) of gas C remained. So, if gas C is H2, then the initial H2 moles would be 0.1 moles.

But wait, let's think: after tube 3, the gas is H2. So, before tube 3, the gas after tube 2 had CO and H2. Let's say the moles of H2 were y, and moles of CO were x.

In tube 3, x moles of CO reacted, producing x moles of CO2. But the problem states that only H2 remained, so CO must have been completely consumed. So x = 0.05 moles.

So, after reaction, all CO is gone, and you have y moles of H2.

But the final gas is 0.1 moles, which is y = 0.1 moles.

So, the initial gas after tube 2 was CO (0.05 mol) and H2 (0.1 mol).

So, the initial gas after tube 1 and 2 had 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 moles of gas.

Wait, but wait: the initial gases after tube 1, which absorbed H2O (0.2 mol), must have been CO, H2, and maybe other gases. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial decomposition of salts A and B produces H2O, CO, and H2. So, the total moles of gases would be moles of H2O (0.2) plus moles of CO and H2.

But after passing through tube 1, H2O is removed, leaving CO and H2.

In tube 3, CO is consumed, and H2 remains.

But according to the problem, the remaining gas is 0.1 moles. So, H2 is 0.1 moles.

So, the initial moles of H2 after tube 2 is 0.1, and CO is 0.05.

So, total moles of gas after tube 2 is 0.15. But wait, the initial total moles would have been higher, including the H2O which was 0.2 moles.

Wait, but the initial salts produced 0.2 moles of H2O, plus 0.15 moles of other gases (CO and H2). So, the initial gas mixture has 0.35 moles.

But wait, perhaps the initial decomposition produces more gases. Let me think: salts A and B, when heated, produce H2O, CO, and H2. So, the total moles would be 0.2 (from H2O) + (CO + H2) moles.

But after tube 1, H2O is removed, leaving CO and H2. Their total moles would be 0.15, as discussed.

Now, the problem says that the total weight of salts A and B is 7.20g. They are equimolar, so let's say each salt is n moles, so total moles are 2n, and molar masses would be M_A and M_B.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about the moles of each salt. Since they're equimolar, the number of moles of A = moles of B = n. So total moles of salts is 2n, and total mass is 7.20g = n(M_A + M_B).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think about the gases produced.

Assuming that salts A and B decompose to produce H2O, CO, and H2. Let's model each salt's decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt is a carbonate, but that would produce CO2, which would have reacted in tube 2, but we know that tube 2 didn't change, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps they are sulfites, which produce SO2, but again, that would have reacted with tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

Alternatively, maybe they are nitrites, which decompose to form NO or NO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the total moles of each gas.

H2O: 0.2 mol (from tube 1).

CO: 0.05 mol (from tube 3 reaction).

H2: 0.1 mol (final gas).

So, total moles of gases produced: 0.2 +0.05 +0.1 = 0.35 mol.

But wait, the initial salts are 7.20g. Let's think about the molar masses of the salts.

Assuming that each salt produces these gases.

Wait, perhaps each salt produces H2O, CO, and H2 upon heating. Let me think about what kind of salts would do that.

For example, suppose the salts are metal carbonyls, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that upon heating, they decompose to metal oxides, CO, and H2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the salts are ammonium carbamates or something similar. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are like sodium bicarbonate, which upon heating produces CO2, H2O, and NaOH, but that would produce CO2, which would react in tube 2, which it didn't.

Wait, perhaps the salts are copper(II) carbonate hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into CuO, CO2, and H2O. But again, CO2 would have reacted in tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible formulas of the salts and what their decomposition products are.

Wait, let's think about the gases. The gases are H2O, CO, and H2. Let's figure out what salts would produce these upon heating.

Consider the decomposition of a metal carbonyl, but I'm not familiar enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that they contain both carbonate and another component, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the salts are sodium formate or something else. Alternatively, maybe they're metal oxides with carbonate groups.

Alternatively, think about the reaction for each salt.

Let me consider the possible decomposition of a salt into H2O, CO, and H2. For example, a metal bicarbonate might decompose into CO2, H2O, and the metal hydroxide, but that would produce CO2, which reacts with tube 2, which it didn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are something like sodium azide, but that produces N2, which doesn't react in tube 2.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the standpoint of the total moles of each gas and the mass of the salts.

Total mass of salts is 7.20g. The moles of H2O is 0.2, CO 0.05, H2 0.1. So total moles of gases are 0.35.

Assuming that the salts decompose completely into these gases, perhaps each mole of salt produces a certain amount of these gases.

Wait, but it's more likely that each salt contributes to the gases. Let's suppose that each salt is a binary salt, perhaps of the formula M(CO)x(H2)yOz, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt upon decomposition produces H2O, CO, and H2 in particular molar ratios.

Wait, let's think about the gases. The total moles of H2O is 0.2, which is the highest. Let's think about hydrogen and carbon in the salts.

The H2O has 0.2*(2H +1O) = 0.4 H and 0.2 O.

CO has 0.05*(1C +1O) = 0.05 C and 0.05 O.

H2 has 0.1*(2H) = 0.2 H.

So total H from all gases: 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 mol.

Total C: 0.05 mol.

Total O: 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.

So the salts must have provided these amounts of H, C, and O.

Now, the salts are composed of some metal(s) and these elements.

Assuming that the salts are metal carbonates or bicarbonates, but earlier analysis suggested that would produce CO2, which didn't react in tube 2, which it should have.

Alternatively, maybe the salts contain both carbonate and bicarbonate groups, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of the form MCOOH (metal formate), which upon heating might decompose into CO, H2O, and the metal oxide.

Wait, let's take sodium formate (NaHCOO) as an example. When heated, sodium formate decomposes into sodium oxide (Na2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and water (H2O). The reaction would be:

2 NaHCOO → Na2O + CO + H2O.

So per 2 moles of NaHCOO, we get 1 mole of Na2O, 1 mole of CO, and 1 mole of H2O.

So, the molar ratio of CO and H2O would be 1:1, which in our case, CO is 0.05 and H2O is 0.2, which is a ratio of 1:4. So perhaps each salt produces more H2O than CO.

Wait, but in our case, the H2O is 0.2 and CO is 0.05, so a ratio of 4:1.

So if I have a salt that produces 4 moles of H2O for each mole of CO, perhaps something like MCOOH decomposing into M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is: MCOOH → M(OH) + CO + H2O.

Wait, but that's not a balanced equation. Let me try to balance it.

Let me assume the decomposition of MCOOH: suppose it's

MCOOH → M(OH) + CO + H2O.

But let's balance:

M: 1 on each side.

C: 1 on each side.

O on left: 2 (from MCOOH) + O from OH, CO, H2O.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the decomposition reaction.

Let me think of MCOOH decomposing into M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

The reaction would be: 2 MCOOH → M(OH)2 + 2 CO + H2O.

Let's count atoms:

Left: 2 M, 2 C, 2*(O in COOH: 2 O) → 4 O, plus 2 H (from COOH).

Right: M, 2 O (from OH2), 2 C (from CO), 2 O (from CO) + 2 H and 1 O (from H2O). So O total is 2 (from OH2) + 2*1 (CO) + 1 (H2O) = 5 O.

Wait, perhaps this isn't balancing. Alternatively, maybe the decomposition produces H2 gas as well. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition of MCOOH produces M, CO, and H2O, and H2.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is more complex. Another possibility is that the salt is a metal hydrous carbonate, like MgCO3·H2O, which upon heating decomposes into MgO, CO2, and H2O. But that would produce CO2, which would react in tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of the formula MCOO M'OH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the salts are sodium bicarbonate, but that would produce CO2, which would have reacted in tube 2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the total elements in the salts and the gases.

The salts contain M (metal), and perhaps O, C, H.

The gases are H2O (H, O), CO (C, O), H2 (H). So the salts must contain C, H, O, and the metal(s).

Now, the salts are equimolar, each with n moles. So total moles of each salt is n, so 2n moles in total.

Total mass of salts: 7.20g = 2n × (molar mass).

The molar mass of each salt would be M = sum of atomic masses of all atoms in the formula.

Our goal is to find the total number of atoms in each salt. Let's say each salt has a formula with a certain number of atoms. For example, if each salt has a formula like M(CO)x(H2O)y, then each unit would have 1 M, x C, x O, y H, and y O.

Wait, but perhaps each salt is of the formula MCOOH, which is formate. Let's think about that.

If each salt is MCOOH, which upon heating gives M(OH), CO, and H2O. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the ratio of H2O to CO is 4:1 in the gases.

So, let's try to model this.

Suppose each mole of salt A and B produces a certain amount of the gases.

Let me denote salt A as MCOOH. When heated, it decomposes as:

2 MCOOH → M(OH)2 + CO + H2O.

Wait, let me balance this equation.

Left side: 2 MCOOH → 2 M, 2 C, 4 O, 2 H.

Right side: M(OH)2 → M, 2 O, 2 H.

CO → C, O.

H2O → 2 H, O.

So, let's balance:

- M: 2 on left, 1 on right → multiply M(OH)2 by 2: 2 M(OH)2 → 2 M, 4 O, 4 H.

Now, the equation becomes:

2 MCOOH → 2 M(OH)2 + CO + H2O.

Now, let's balance C and O:

Left: 2 C.

Right: 1 C (from CO) → need another C. Let's add another CO.

So:

2 MCOOH → 2 M(OH)2 + 2 CO + H2O.

Now, check O:

Left: 2 COOH → 2*(O and OH groups) → 2*(2 O) =4 O.

Right: 2 M(OH)2 → 2*(2 O) =4 O.

2 CO → 2*O = 2 O.

H2O → 1 O.

Total O on right:4 +2 +1=7 O.

Left: Each MCOOH has 2 O (from COOH: C-O-OH?), wait, wait: MCOOH is CHOO^- M^+, so each MCOOH has 2 O from COO^- and one O from OH, so 3 O per MCOOH. So 2 MCOOH → 6 O.

But on the right, we have 4 (from 2 M(OH)2) + 2*(CO: each has 1 O) → 2 O, plus H2O: 1 O → total 4+2+1=7 O.

So 2 MCOOH → 6 O on left, but right has 7 O. So we're missing one O somewhere.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the decomposition. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let me consider the decomposition of a metal formate, MCOOH, upon heating.

The decomposition reaction is:

2 MCOOH → M(OH)2 + CO ↑ + H2O(g).

Wait, let me count atoms:

M: 2 on left, 1 on right → not balanced.

C: 2 on left, 1 on right → not balanced.

O: let's see, each MCOOH has 3 O (C=O-OH?), so 2 MCOOH → 6 O.

On the right: M(OH)2 → 2 O. CO → 1 O. H2O → 1 O. Total O: 2 +1 +1=4. So 6 O on left, 4 on right. Not balanced.

So, perhaps the reaction needs to have more CO or more H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

4 MCOOH → 2 M(OH)2 + 3 CO + H2O.

Let me check:

M: 4 → 2 → not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find a balanced equation elsewhere or think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt A is sodium carbonate, which upon heating produces Na2O, CO2, and H2O. But that would produce CO2, which would have reacted in tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

I'm stuck on the exact decomposition products. Maybe I should try another approach.

Let me think about the moles of each element in the salts. The total moles of H, C, and O in the salts must equal the moles present in the gases.

Wait, the gases have:

H: 0.6 moles.

C: 0.05 moles.

O: 0.25 moles.

Now, the salts have some formula containing these elements plus metal(s). Let's assume that the salts are of the form M(CO)x(OH)y. Then, each mole of salt would contribute x CO, y H2O, etc.

But perhaps each salt contributes a certain ratio of the gases. Let me think that each salt, when heated, produces a certain amount of H2O, CO, and H2.

Wait, perhaps each salt produces a certain number of H2O, CO, and H2. Let's model each salt as producing a specific number of moles of these gases.

But without knowing the exact decomposition, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the salts are composed of a metal, carbon, and hydrogen, with oxygen as part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the salts are ammonium salts, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of the formula MCOOH (metal formate), which upon heating decomposes into metal oxide, CO, and H2O.

But earlier attempts to balance the equation didn't work out, so perhaps it's better to consider that each mole of salt produces 0.4 moles of H2O, 0.1 moles of CO, and 0.2 moles of H2.

Wait, but the total from the gases is 0.2 H2O, 0.05 CO, and 0.1 H2.

So, in terms of moles per salt, perhaps each salt produces 0.1 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of CO, and 0.05 moles of H2. Since there are two salts in equimolar amounts, the total would be 0.2, 0.05, and 0.1.

But how does that translate into the formula of the salts?

Alternatively, perhaps each salt produces 0.1 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of CO, and 0.05 moles of H2 per mole.

Wait, maybe each salt produces a certain ratio of the gases. Let's say each mole of salt produces a moles of H2O, b moles of CO, and c moles of H2.

So, for two salts (n moles each), total would be 2n a =0.2, 2n b=0.05, 2n c=0.1.

So:

a = 0.2/(2n) = 0.1/n.

b = 0.05/(2n) = 0.025/n.

c =0.1/(2n)=0.05/n.

But without knowing n, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the salts produce the gases in a certain molar ratio, such as 4 H2O : 1 CO : 2 H2.

In that case, the ratio would be 4:1:2.

So, for every 4 moles of H2O, there's 1 mole of CO and 2 of H2.

In our case, H2O is 0.2, CO 0.05, H2 0.1. Let's check the ratios:

0.2 (H2O) : 0.05 (CO) : 0.1 (H2) → 4:1:2.

Yes, that matches. So the ratio is 4:1:2.

Therefore, each mole of salt produces 4 moles of H2O, 1 mole of CO, and 2 moles of H2.

Wait, but that would mean that each salt produces these gases in a 4:1:2 ratio. So, for each mole of salt, 4 H2O, 1 CO, 2 H2.

So, for two salts (each n moles), total would be 8n H2O, 2n CO, 4n H2.

Wait, but in our case, the totals are 0.2, 0.05, 0.1. So:

8n =0.2 → n=0.025.

2n=0.05 → n=0.025.

4n=0.1 → n=0.025.

Yes, that works. So each salt is 0.025 moles. So total moles of salts is 2 * 0.025 = 0.05 moles.

But the total mass of salts is 7.20g. So each mole of salt has a molar mass of 7.20g /0.05 mol = 144 g/mol.

So each salt has a molar mass of 144 g/mol.

Now, each salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2 per mole. Let's find out the formula of the salt.

Each mole of salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2.

Wait, the decomposition reaction could be:

Salt → products + gases.

But perhaps the salt can be considered as a combination of the gases and some metal oxide.

Wait, perhaps the salt is a hydrate, like M(CO)_something·nH2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition reaction is:

M(CO)_x (OH)_y → M oxide + CO + H2O.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the elements involved.

Each H2O molecule has 2 H and 1 O.

Each CO has 1 C and 1 O.

Each H2 has 2 H.

So, per mole of salt:

H2O:4 → 4*(2H + O) → 8 H and 4 O.

CO:1 → 1 C and 1 O.

H2:2 → 4 H.

Total per mole of salt:

C:1.

O:4 (from H2O) +1 (from CO) =5 O.

H:8 (from H2O) +4 (from H2) =12 H.

So, per mole of salt: 1 C, 12 H, 5 O.

Assuming the salt is of the form M(CO)(H2O)_something.

Wait, but the decomposition would produce M as an oxide. Let me think about the metal.

Assume the metal is M, and the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_something·something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, which would give:

M:1.

CO:1 → C:1, O:1.

H2O:4 → H:8, O:4.

So per mole: C:1, H:8, O:5.

But earlier, per mole of salt, we have C:1, H:12, O:5.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4 plus something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2. But that would be a bit odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_4. Then, upon decomposition, it would produce M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

Wait, but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2O. Then, upon decomposition, it would lose H2O as gas, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_4 → upon heating, produces M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

But, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the elements.

Each mole of the salt contains 1 C, 12 H, 5 O, and the metal M.

So the formula could be M(CO)(H2O)_4. Let's check:

M(CO)(H2O)_4 → M, CO, 4 H2O.

Which would give:

C:1.

O:1 (from CO) +4*(O from H2O) → 5 O.

H: 4*2 =8 H.

But earlier, per mole of salt, we have 12 H. So perhaps there's more H.

Ah, wait, the H2 gas suggests that there's more H in the salt. So, perhaps the salt has H2O plus H2 in the decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2.

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition also produces H2 gas, which comes from the salt's structure.

Wait, another approach: Since each mole of salt produces 2 moles of H2, which is 4 H atoms, then the salt must have 4 H atoms per mole that are released as H2. So, perhaps the salt has 4 H atoms as H2 in its structure.

Additionally, the H2O contributes 8 H atoms per mole of salt.

So, total H in salt: 8 (from H2O) + 4 (from H2) =12 H per mole of salt.

So, the salt's formula includes 12 H, 1 C, 5 O, and the metal M.

So, the formula could be MCOOH4, which is M(COOH)4, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps it's M(CO)(H2O)4.

Wait, but M(CO)(H2O)4 would have:

C:1.

O:1 (CO) + 4*(O from H2O) =5 O.

H: 8 H.

So, not enough H. We need 12 H per mole.

So, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)4·H2.

But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)4·H2O, which would add another H2O, giving:

H: 8 + 2 =10 H.

Still not enough.

Wait, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)4·H2. Then:

H from H2O:4 *2 =8.

H from H2:2.

Total H:10. Still not 12.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2O.

Then H from H2O is 4*2 +2*2=12 H.

Yes! So, the formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2O → M(CO)(H2O)_6.

Wait, but then:

H from H2O:6 *2 =12 H.

So, in that case, the formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_6.

Which would give:

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +6*(O from H2O)=7 O.

But earlier, per mole of salt, we have 5 O. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead think about the total atoms in the salt.

Each salt has a formula that includes 1 C, 12 H, 5 O, and the metal M.

The formula could be MCO(OH)4, which would be:

M:1.

C:1.

O: (from CO:1) + (from OH in each of 4 groups:4) → 5 O.

H: (4 *1) from OH groups →4 H.

But wait, that's only 4 H, but we need 12 H per mole. So that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O. Then:

H from H2O:4*2 +2 =10 H.

Not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps it's M(CO)(H2O)_6, which gives H:6*2=12.

O:1 (from CO) +6 (from H2O) =7 O.

But earlier, per mole of salt, O is 5. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I thought that each mole of salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2.

So, per mole of salt:

H2O:4 → H:8, O:4.

CO:1 → C:1, O:1.

H2:2 → H:4.

So total per mole of salt:

C:1.

H:8+4=12.

O:4+1=5.

So, the formula must include C, H, O, and M.

Perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would mean:

H from H2O:4 *2=8.

H from H2:2.

Total H:10.

Not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Which would give H: 4*2 + 4 =12.

O:4 (from H2O) +1 (CO) =5.

Yes! So formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual. Let me check:

M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2 → upon heating, this would decompose into M, CO, H2O, and H2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

But that's 12 H, 5 O, and 1 C per mole.

So, the formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

So, the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which can be written as M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2 → M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

But this seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps it's M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O, but that would give O=6, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else.

But perhaps it's better to think of the formula as M(CO)(H2O)_4· H2, which would give the required H and O.

So, the molar mass of the salt would be:

M (metal) + (CO) + 4*(H2O) + (H2).

So, M + (12 +16) + 4*(2+16) + (2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

So, M is the molar mass of the metal.

CO has a molar mass of 12 + 16 =28 g/mol.

Each H2O is 2 +16 =18 g/mol. Four of them →4*18=72.

H2 is 2 g/mol.

So total molar mass: M + 28 +72 +2 = M +102.

But earlier, we determined that the molar mass of each salt is 144 g/mol.

So, M +102 =144 → M=42 g/mol.

Wait, which metal has an atomic mass of 42? Let me think: titanium is about 48, magnesium is 24.38, sodium is 23, aluminum is 27, potassium is 39, calcium is 40, zinc is 65. Hmm, 42 isn't a common metal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else. Maybe M(CO)(H2O)_4· H2O.

Then, the molar mass would be M +28 +4*(18) +18 = M +28+72+18= M+118.

Set equal to 144 → M=26 g/mol. So, M would be iron? No, iron is ~56. Wait, 26 is close to magnesium (24.3), which is about 24.3.

So, M=24.3 g/mol → Mg.

So, the formula would be Mg(CO)(H2O)_4· H2O.

Wait, but that's:

Mg:24.3.

CO:28.

4 H2O:4*18=72.

H2O:18.

Total:24.3 +28 +72 +18= 142.3 g/mol, which is close to 144. So perhaps that's the salt.

But alternatively, perhaps the formula is Mg(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2.

Which would be:

24.3 +28 +4*18 +2 =24.3+28+72+2=126.3 g/mol. Not close to 144.

Hmm, perhaps the formula isn't including H2, but perhaps the H2 comes from the decomposition of the H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is MgCOOH·4 H2O, which is magnesium formate tetrahydrate.

The molecular formula would be Mg(COOH)·4 H2O.

Which can be written as Mg(COOH)·4 H2O → Mg(COOH)·4 H2O.

Decomposing this upon heating could produce MgO, CO, and H2O, along with H2.

Wait, let me think about the decomposition:

Mg(COOH)·4 H2O → MgO + CO ↑ + H2O(g) + H2 ↑.

But I'm not sure if that's a balanced equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition reaction is:

2 Mg(COOH)·4 H2O → 2 MgO + 2 CO + 8 H2O + H2.

But this is just a guess, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition produces MgO, CO, H2O, and H2.

But without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to proceed. However, the key point is that each salt has a molar mass of 144 g/mol, and the formula includes C, H, O, and Mg.

But I'm not making much progress on the exact formula. Maybe I should move to the calculation of the total number of atoms.

Each salt has a formula that includes M, C, H, and O atoms.

Assuming the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something, but perhaps the exact formula isn't necessary for the total number of atoms.

Each salt has:

- 1 M atom.

- 1 C from CO.

- 4 H2O groups → 4*(2 H and 1 O) → 8 H and 4 O.

Plus, perhaps additional H and O from other components.

Wait, based on earlier analysis, each mole of salt has 1 C, 12 H, 5 O, and 1 M.

So, the formula could be M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something, but the exact formula isn't necessary for the atom count.

Each salt has 1 M atom, 1 C atom, 12 H atoms, and 5 O atoms.

So, the total number of atoms per salt is 1 (M) +1 (C) +12 (H) +5 (O) =19 atoms.

Wait, but wait:

M:1.

C:1.

H:12.

O:5.

Total:19 atoms per formula unit.

So, each salt has 19 atoms. Since there are two salts (A and B) in equimolar amounts, each contributing 19 atoms, the total number of atoms is 19 *2 =38.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 13,19,17,15.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps each salt has fewer atoms. Let me recount.

If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, then:

M:1.

CO:1 C, 1 O.

Each H2O:2 H, 1 O.

Four H2O:8 H,4 O.

So, total per mole of salt:

M:1.

C:1.

H:8.

O:1 +4=5.

So, 1+1+8+5=15 atoms.

Wait, 1 (M) +1 (C) +8 (H) +5 (O) =15 atoms.

Ah, so each salt has 15 atoms. Since there are two salts (A and B), each with 15 atoms, total atoms would be 15 *2 =30. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but the salts are equimolar, but perhaps each salt has a different formula. Wait, the problem states that it's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, each with the same molar amount. So, if each salt contributes 15 atoms, then two salts would contribute 30 atoms. But the options don't have 30, so something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps each salt has a different number of atoms. For example, salt A has 15 atoms, salt B has 17, making a total of 32. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the total atoms per salt. Let me re-express.

If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, then the formula is MCO(H2O)_4.

So, each formula unit has:

M:1.

C:1.

O from CO:1.

Each H2O:2 H,1 O.

Four H2O: 8 H,4 O.

So, per formula unit:

M:1.

C:1.

H:8.

O:1 +4=5.

Total atoms:1+1+8+5=15.

So each salt has 15 atoms. Two salts would have 30 atoms. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the H2 as part of the salt, like M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Then, the formula would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:5.

H:8 (from H2O) +2 (from H2) =10.

Wait, no, earlier I thought each mole of salt produces 2 moles of H2, which is 4 H, but per mole of H2, it's 2 H. So 2 moles of H2 would be 4 H per mole of salt.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between moles and atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has a formula that includes all the elements except the metal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would include:

M:1.

C:1.

O:5.

H:8 (from H2O) +2 (from H2) =10.

So, per formula unit: M, C, 10 H, 5 O.

Total atoms:1+1+10+5=17.

So each salt has 17 atoms. Two salts would have 34 atoms, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm, the options given are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, making the total 34. But 34 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O.

Which would be:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) +1 (additional H2O) =6 O.

H:8 (from H2O) + 2 (from H2) =10 H.

So per formula unit:1+1+10+6=18 atoms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_3·H2.

Then:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 +3*1=4.

H:3*2=6 + 2=8.

Total atoms:1+1+8+4=14.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_2·H2.

Then:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 +2=3.

H:4 +2=6.

Total atoms:1+1+6+3=11. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

Each salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2.

So, per mole of salt:

H2O:4 → H:8, O:4.

CO:1 → C:1, O:1.

H2:2 → H:4.

Total H:12, C:1, O:5.

Assuming the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) =5 O.

H:8 (H2O) + 2 (H2) =10 H.

Wait, but that gives H:10, but we need 12 H per mole. So perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Which would give H:8 +4=12.

O:1+4=5.

So, formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:5.

H:12.

So, total atoms per formula unit:1+1+12+5=19.

Ah! So each salt has 19 atoms. Since there are two salts (A and B) in equimolar amounts, each contributing 19 atoms, the total is 19 *2=38 atoms.

But the options don't include 38. Hmm.

Wait, but the question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. So each salt has 19 atoms, two salts would have 38. But the options don't have 38, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2, giving 10 H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else.

Wait, maybe the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O, which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 +1=6.

H:8 +2=10.

So, 1+1+10+6=18.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms. Let's see: 1 M, 1 C, 8 H, 7 O.

Wait, where would 7 O come from? If formula is M(CO)(H2O)_6, then O:1 +6=7.

H:6*2=12.

So, formula is M(CO)(H2O)_6.

Which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:7.

H:12.

Total atoms:1+1+12+7=21.

No, that's 21.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is 17, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the salts as metal bicarbonates, which upon heating produce CO2, H2O, and the metal oxide. But earlier analysis suggests that wouldn't fit because CO2 would have reacted in tube 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that each mole produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2, and the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would give 19 atoms per salt, as before.

But since the options don't include 38, perhaps the correct answer is 17, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O, which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) +1 (H2O) =6.

H:8 (H2O) +2 (H2) +2 (H2O) =12.

So, 1+1+12+6=20.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2O, giving:

O:1 +4 +2=7.

H:8 +4=12.

So, 1+1+12+7=21.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something that doesn't add H or O, like another CO. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else, but I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the option that matches 19, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are:

A)13

B)19

C)17

D)15

If each salt has 19 atoms, the total would be 38, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms. Let me recount.

If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something with 2 H2O and 1 H2.

Which would give:

H:8 (H2O) +2 (H2) =10.

But earlier analysis says we need 12 H per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else that adds 2 H.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O·H2.

Which would give:

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) +1 (H2O) =6.

H:8 (H2O) +2 (H2) +2 (H2O) =12.

So, 1+1+12+6=20.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O.

Which would have:

O:1 +4 +1=6.

H:8 +2=10.

So, 1+1+10+6=18.

Not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck on this part. Given the options, I think the correct answer is 17, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms.

Wait, another approach: the molar mass of the salt is 144 g/mol. If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something, and the metal is Mg (24.3 g/mol), then:

CO:28.

4 H2O:4*(18)=72.

Total so far:24.3 +28 +72=124.3.

To reach 144, the remaining is 144-124.3=19.7g/mol, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the formula isn't Mg-based.

Alternatively, if the metal is Na (23), then:

23 +28 +72=123.

144-123=21g/mol left. That could be H2O (18) and H2 (2), totaling 20, which is close. So, perhaps the formula is Na(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O·H2.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Na(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would be:

23 +28 +72 +2=125.

144-125=19g/mol. Doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C)17 or B)19.

But considering that each salt has 17 atoms, the total for two salts would be 34, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, and the answer is option C)17. But the total atoms would be 17 *2=34, which isn't an option, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the problem asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which are a mixture. So perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, making the total 17 *2=34, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, but the question asks for the sum of all atoms in A and B, which would be 17 + another 17 =34, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 15 atoms. The total would be 30, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, which has 15 atoms, so two salts would have 30. But again, no option.

I'm stuck. Considering the options, I think the correct answer is B)19, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the total number of atoms in an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which weigh 7.20 g in total. Upon heating, the salts produce a mixture of gases: H₂O, CO, and H₂. These gases are analyzed using three tubes:

1. **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: The mass increases by 3.60 g, indicating the absorption of H₂O. The moles of H₂O are calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = \frac{3.60}{18} = 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: The weight remains unchanged, indicating no reaction with CO₂ or SO₂, implying the gas does not contain these substances.

3. **Tube №3 (Red-hot Cu)**: The mass increases by 0.80 g, and CuO is formed. This suggests the gas contains CO, as CO reacts with Cu to form CuO. The moles of CO are calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = \frac{0.80}{16} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

The remaining gas after all tubes is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP), corresponding to:

   \[
   \text{Moles of gas C} = \frac{2.24}{22.4} = 0.1 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

### Analysis of the Gases
- **H₂O**: 0.2 mol.
- **CO**: 0.05 mol.
- **H₂**: 0.1 mol (remaining gas).

The total moles of gases produced are:

   \[
   0.2 + 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.35 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

### Determining the Formula of the Salts
The salts decompose to produce H₂O, CO, and H₂. Assuming the salts are equimolar and produce these gases in a specific molar ratio, the decomposition reaction can be modeled as:

   \[
   \text{Salt} \rightarrow \text{Metal oxide} + \text{CO} + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2.
   \]

From the gas moles, the ratio of H₂O to CO to H₂ is **4:1:2**. This implies each mole of salt produces 4 moles of H₂O, 1 mole of CO, and 2 moles of H₂.

### Molar Mass of the Salts
The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, and they are equimolar. Let the number of moles of each salt be \( n \). The total moles of salts are \( 2n \), and their molar mass is:

   \[
   \text{Molar mass of each salt} = \frac{7.20}{2n}.
   \]

From the gas stoichiometry, each mole of salt contributes 1 C, 12 H, and 5 O (from H₂O and CO). Assuming the salt contains a metal \( M \), the formula can be represented as \( M(\text{CO})(\text{H}_2\text{O})_4 \). The molar mass of the salt is:

   \[
   M + 28 + 4 \times 18 = M + 92.
   \]

Given the molar mass of the salt is 144 g/mol:

   \[
   M + 92 = 144 \implies M = 52 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

This corresponds to the metal **Mg** (atomic mass ≈ 24.3 g/mol), suggesting the salt might be magnesium-based.

### Total Number of Atoms in the Salts
Each salt has the formula \( M(\text{CO})(\text{H}_2\text{O})_4 \), which contains:

- 1 \( M \) atom,
- 1 C atom,
- 8 H atoms (from \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \)),
- 5 O atoms (1 from CO and 4 from \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \)).

Thus, each salt contains:

   \[
   1 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 15 \, \text{atoms}.
   \]

Since the salts are equimolar, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is:

   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30.
   \]

However, this does not match the provided options. Reassessing the formula, if the salt includes additional hydrogen or oxygen, the total number of atoms could increase. Given the options, the most plausible answer is **19 atoms per salt**, leading to a total of 38 atoms for both salts. Since this is not an option, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to understand what's going on.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through several tubes without cooling first.

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube №1), then a Ca(OH)2 solution (tube №2), and then red-hot copper (tube №3). The results are that tube №1 and №3 gained 3.60 grams and 0.80 grams, respectively. Tube №2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let me think about what each of these tubes does. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent and can react with water, maybe. Or wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a desiccant and can absorb water of crystallization. But in this case, maybe it's absorbing water from the gases.

Tube №1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. So the gases pass through it, and the weight increased by 3.60g. This suggests that Mg(ClO4)2 absorbed some water vapor. Because when Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which increases the mass. So the increase in mass is the mass of water absorbed.

So, the mass increase in tube 1 is 3.60g, which equals the mass of H2O. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g / (18 g/mol) = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O are in the gas mixture.

Tube №3 is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper exposed to gases can react with certain gases. Common reactions are with CO2, H2S, SO3, etc. Wait, but the problem states that CuO was formed. So the gas must have contained a substance that reacts with copper to form CuO. What gases would do that? CO (carbon monoxide) reacts with CuO to form CO2 and Cu, but wait, in the presence of heat, maybe the reverse happens. Alternatively, maybe CO reacts with CuO at high temperatures, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's H2S. H2S would react with hot CuO to form CuS, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, but that might not react with CuO. Or perhaps the gas is SO2 or another sulfur compound.

Wait, another possibility: when a gas like H2S passes over hot copper, it might not react. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with CO2. But CO2 doesn't react with CuO under normal conditions unless there's a catalyst. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the gas is H2O vapor, but that doesn't seem right because water vapor would have been absorbed in tube 1.

Wait, but the problem says that in tube 3, the weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. That suggests that the gas that passed through caused Cu to react and form CuO. So the reaction is probably 2 Cu + O2 -> 2 CuO. But wait, that would require O2, but O2 might not be present. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO. Wait, CO would react with CuO as follows: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. But since the tube was red-hot, maybe this reaction occurs. But how would that affect the mass?

Wait, if the gas is CO, then in tube 3, the CO would react with CuO (if any) to produce Cu and CO2. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2S, which could react with CuO as follows: H2S + CuO → CuS + H2O. But I'm not certain about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a sulfur-containing oxide like SO2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O, but in that case, the Mg(ClO4)2 would have absorbed all of it earlier in tube 1. So perhaps the gas that reacts in tube 3 is CO2. But as I thought earlier, CO2 doesn't react with CuO unless there's a catalyst.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider what each tube captures. Tube 1 captures water, so the gas has H2O. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the tube's weight didn't change, that suggests that CO2 wasn't present. Because if there were CO2, tube 2 would have gained mass. But in this case, tube 2 didn't change, so perhaps there was no CO2 in the gas.

Wait, but what if the gas was SO2? Because SO2 is a gas that could pass through, and if it passed through tube 2, which is a solution of Ca(OH)2, it would react. The reaction is SO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaSO3 + H2O. So if SO2 was present, tube 2 would have gained mass. But since the weight didn't change, that suggests no SO2 in the gas. So, the gas that passed through tube 2 didn't react with Ca(OH)2, meaning no CO2, no SO2, no H2S (since H2S would react with Ca(OH)2: H2S + Ca(OH)2 → CaS + 2 H2O). So, the gas passed through tube 2 without reacting, meaning the gas must have been something like H2, N2, O2, or maybe something else inert under these conditions.

Wait, but the problem states that after passing through all the tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas is 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

But what is gas C? Let's think. The gas that didn't react in the last tube must be something that isn't reactive here. Let's think about the gases that are possible.

So, the initial heating of salts A and B produced a mixture of gases. Let me think of what these could be. Salts when heated can decompose to produce various gases. For example, nitrates decompose to form NO2, or KNO3 might produce KNO2, O2, etc. Or sulfites decompose to SO2 and CO2. Or carbonates decompose to CO2 and something else. But since the initial salts are equimolar, perhaps they're a mixture that upon heating gives off a combination of gases.

Wait, but the problem says that the mixture of salts upon heating gives a mixture of gases. The gases are passed through these tubes. Let's think step by step.

First, the gas mixture is passed through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2). The weight increased by 3.60g, which we think is H2O. So the gases must have contained H2O vapor.

Then, the gas passes through tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution). The weight didn't change, so whatever was in the gas didn't react with the solution. So the gas didn't have CO2 or SO2, as these would have reacted. So perhaps the remaining gas after this step is something inert, like O2 or N2, but more likely a gas that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution.

But wait, another possibility: the gas could have been H2. H2 doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution, I think. Because H2 would have to bubble through it, and unless there's a catalyst, it wouldn't react. Similarly, O2 wouldn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3, but NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form Ca(NH2)2 or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, but NH3 is a base, so it would react with Ca(OH)2. So if the gas had NH3, then tube 2 would have reacted, but since the weight didn't change, NH3 isn't present.

So, the gas that's left after tube 2 must be something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution. Let's think about the possible gases: H2, O2, N2, maybe CO (but I'm not sure if CO would react with Ca(OH)2). Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else.

Then, the gas goes through tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So the gas must have contained something that reacts with copper upon heating to form CuO. Let's think about possible gases.

CO is a possibility. When CO reacts with CuO, it forms Cu and CO2. Let me write the reaction:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

But what would be the mass change in tube 3 for this reaction? Let's calculate.

Suppose we have x moles of CO reacting. The reaction consumes x moles of CO and produces x moles of CO2. The mass of CO is 28g/mol * x, and CO2 is 44g/mol *x. But in the reaction, the mass change would be: the mass of the product (CO2) minus the mass of the reactant (CO). So for each mole, the mass increases by 16g/mol (44 - 28 = 16). So if the mass increase is 0.80g, then x = 0.80g /16g/mol = 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 moles of CO would react, producing 0.05 moles of CO2. But wait, the gas after tube 3 is the gas that didn't react, and it's 2.24 L, which is 0.1 mol. So perhaps the initial gas mixture had 0.1 mol of CO, which all reacted in tube 3, but that doesn't add up because the reaction would produce CO2, which is a gas, so it would contribute to the final volume.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's see: the gas that passed through all the tubes and ended up as gas C is 0.1 moles. Let's think about what this could be.

So, the gases after tube 3 are 0.1 moles. So possible gas C could be O2, N2, or perhaps another inert gas. Alternatively, maybe it's H2, but H2 wouldn't react with CuO unless in specific conditions.

Wait, but the initial gases after tube 1 and 2 would have some gases left. Let me think about what remains after each step.

After tube 1, the H2O is absorbed. So the remaining gases are those that don't react with Mg(ClO4)2. Then, in tube 2, any CO2 or SO2 would have been absorbed if present, but since the weight didn't change, perhaps the gas doesn't contain those. So what's left is something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like H2, O2, N2, etc.

Then, in tube 3, any gas that reacts with Cu would be consumed, leaving only the inert gas. So, for example, if the gas after tube 2 was CO and H2, then CO would react in tube 3, but H2 might not. Alternatively, perhaps it's O2, which wouldn't react with CuO unless in presence of a catalyst.

Wait, but the problem says that CuO was formed in tube 3. So the reaction must have involved the gas in tube 3 reacting with Cu to form CuO. Let's think about what gas would do that.

If the gas is O2, then O2 would react with hot Cu to form CuO: 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. In this case, each mole of O2 would produce 2 moles of CuO. The mass increase would be the mass of O in O2. So for each mole of O2, mass increase is 32g (since O2 is 32g/mol, and CuO is 80g/mol per mole, but the molar mass change is 80g/mol for 2 moles of CuO, but perhaps this is getting complicated.

Wait, another way: Suppose the gas was O2. Then, 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. For each mole of O2, the mass of CuO formed is 2*(80) = 160g. The mass of O2 is 32g. So the mass increase would be 160 - 32 = 128g per mole of O2. But in our case, the mass increase is 0.80g. So 0.80g = 128g/mol * x → x = 0.80/128 = 0.00625 mol. So if it was O2, then 0.00625 moles. But gas C would then be the remaining gas after this reaction.

Wait, but the residual gas after tube 3 is 0.1 moles. So let's calculate the total moles before and after.

Wait, the initial gas after tube 2 must have some moles, and then in tube 3, some reacts, leaving 0.1 moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas in tube 3 is H2S. Let me think. H2S reacting with Cu would produce CuS and H2. The reaction is H2S + Cu → CuS + H2. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + H2↑. But I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe H2S reacts with CuO: H2S + CuO → CuS + H2O. But in that case, the mass gain would be from the H2S. H2S has a molar mass of 34g/mol. If 0.05 moles of H2S (since 0.05 *34=1.7g) reacted, but the mass increase is 0.80g, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2. SO2 would react with Cu: 2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuSO3 + O2. Wait, no, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where SO2 reacts with CuO: SO2 + CuO → CuSO3. Hmm.

Let me step back. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. So, the reaction must involve the gas reacting with Cu to form CuO, and the mass increase is the mass of O added. Let me think of the reaction where a gas provides O to form CuO.

For example, if the gas is CO, the reaction is CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. The molar mass of CO is 28g/mol, and CO2 is 44g/mol. So for each mole of CO, the system gains 44 - 28 = 16g. So, if the mass increase is 0.80g, then moles of CO would be 0.80 / 16 = 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 moles of CO reacted. Let's check what that would mean. The gas after tube 3 would be the unreacted CO, but wait, no, the reaction consumes CO and produces CO2. So, if we started with x moles of CO, and y moles reacted, then the remaining CO would be (x - y), but actually, the reaction produces CO2, which would be a different gas. But in the problem, the final gas is gas C, which is 0.1 moles, so perhaps gas C is CO2.

Wait, but in the problem, the gas that remains is 2.24 L, which is 0.1 moles. Let me think again.

So, initial gas mixture after tube 2: Let's say we have CO and H2. Then, in tube 3, CO reacts with CuO to form CO2 and Cu. The reaction is:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

This reaction consumes CO and produces CO2. The mass increase in tube 3 would be the mass of CO2 minus the mass of CO. So for each mole, the mass increases by 16g (44 - 28 = 16). So 0.80g increase corresponds to 0.80 /16 = 0.05 moles of CO reacted.

So, if 0.05 moles of CO reacted, then the moles of CO consumed is 0.05, and moles of CO2 produced is 0.05.

Now, what's the setup? The initial mixture of salts A and B, upon heating, produces H2O, CO, and H2 perhaps. Then, when passed through the tubes:

- Tube 1: H2O is absorbed, 0.2 moles (3.6g/18g/mol).
- Tube 2: Doesn't react, so no CO2, SO2, etc. So perhaps the remaining gases are H2 and CO.
- Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CO2 and increase mass by 0.80g (0.05 moles CO reacted), leaving H2 as gas C.

Wait, but H2 is a possibility for gas C. Let's see. If the initial gas after tube 2 was H2 and CO, then in tube 3, CO would react, leaving H2. The moles of H2 would be the initial amount minus any that reacted. Wait, but H2 doesn't react with CuO unless in specific conditions, like with a catalyst.

Wait, but in the problem, the final gas is 0.1 moles, which would correspond to H2 if that's gas C. Let me think about the total moles.

Wait, let's try to outline all the steps:

1. Heated salts A and B produce gases: H2O, CO, and H2.

2. Pass through Mg(ClO4)2: H2O absorbed (0.2 moles), so the remaining gas is CO and H2.

3. Pass through Ca(OH)2 solution: No reaction, so CO and H2 remain.

4. Pass through red-hot Cu: CO reacts, producing CO2. The mass increase is 0.80g, which is 0.05 moles CO. So, from CO, 0.05 moles reacted, producing 0.05 moles CO2.

Now, the gas after tube 3 would be the unreacted CO plus any H2.

But wait, the initial gas after tube 2 would contain CO and H2. Let's say the initial moles of CO and H2 after tube 2 are a and b, respectively.

In tube 3, CO reacts. Let's say all of the CO reacts, but that's not possible because the mass increase is 0.80g, which is 0.05 moles. So, initial CO moles = x, and after reaction, some remains if x > 0.05.

Wait, but the problem says that after all, only gas C remains, which is 0.1 moles. So perhaps all the CO reacted, and the remaining gas is H2.

So, let's model this.

Let me denote:

After tube 1: the gas has only CO and H2, because H2O is absorbed.

After tube 2: same, because no reaction.

In tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CO2, and H2 remains.

The mass increase in tube 3 comes from the CO reacting. So, the moles of CO reacted is 0.05 mol.

So, initial moles of CO after tube 2 was 0.05 mol. So, after reaction, CO is 0, and CO2 is 0.05 mol. But wait, the problem says that CuO was formed, which suggests that the reaction is between CO and CuO. So, perhaps the Cu is in the form of CuO, and the reaction is CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

In this reaction, for each mole of CO, 1 mole of CO2 is produced, and the mass change is 16g/mol (as CO2 is 44g, CO is 28g, so 16g increase per mole).

So, 0.80g increase means 0.05 moles of CO reacted, producing 0.05 moles of CO2.

But what about the H2? H2 doesn't react with CuO unless under specific conditions, which might not be the case here. So, the H2 would pass through without reacting, and the CO would be consumed, leaving H2 as gas C.

But wait, the problem says that after all the tubes, 2.24 L (0.1 moles) of gas C remained. So, if gas C is H2, then the initial H2 moles would be 0.1 moles.

But wait, let's think: after tube 3, the gas is H2. So, before tube 3, the gas after tube 2 had CO and H2. Let's say the moles of H2 were y, and moles of CO were x.

In tube 3, x moles of CO reacted, producing x moles of CO2. But the problem states that only H2 remained, so CO must have been completely consumed. So x = 0.05 moles.

So, after reaction, all CO is gone, and you have y moles of H2.

But the final gas is 0.1 moles, which is y = 0.1 moles.

So, the initial gas after tube 2 was CO (0.05 mol) and H2 (0.1 mol).

So, the initial gas after tube 1 and 2 had 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 moles of gas.

Wait, but wait: the initial gases after tube 1, which absorbed H2O (0.2 mol), must have been CO, H2, and maybe other gases. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial decomposition of salts A and B produces H2O, CO, and H2. So, the total moles of gases would be moles of H2O (0.2) plus moles of CO and H2.

But after passing through tube 1, H2O is removed, leaving CO and H2.

In tube 3, CO is consumed, and H2 remains.

But according to the problem, the remaining gas is 0.1 moles. So, H2 is 0.1 moles.

So, the initial moles of H2 after tube 2 is 0.1, and CO is 0.05.

So, total moles of gas after tube 2 is 0.15. But wait, the initial total moles would have been higher, including the H2O which was 0.2 moles.

Wait, but the initial salts produced 0.2 moles of H2O, plus 0.15 moles of other gases (CO and H2). So, the initial gas mixture has 0.35 moles.

But wait, perhaps the initial decomposition produces more gases. Let me think: salts A and B, when heated, produce H2O, CO, and H2. So, the total moles would be 0.2 (from H2O) + (CO + H2) moles.

But after tube 1, H2O is removed, leaving CO and H2. Their total moles would be 0.15, as discussed.

Now, the problem says that the total weight of salts A and B is 7.20g. They are equimolar, so let's say each salt is n moles, so total moles are 2n, and molar masses would be M_A and M_B.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about the moles of each salt. Since they're equimolar, the number of moles of A = moles of B = n. So total moles of salts is 2n, and total mass is 7.20g = n(M_A + M_B).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think about the gases produced.

Assuming that salts A and B decompose to produce H2O, CO, and H2. Let's model each salt's decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt is a carbonate, but that would produce CO2, which would have reacted in tube 2, but we know that tube 2 didn't change, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps they are sulfites, which produce SO2, but again, that would have reacted with tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

Alternatively, maybe they are nitrites, which decompose to form NO or NO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the total moles of each gas.

H2O: 0.2 mol (from tube 1).

CO: 0.05 mol (from tube 3 reaction).

H2: 0.1 mol (final gas).

So, total moles of gases produced: 0.2 +0.05 +0.1 = 0.35 mol.

But wait, the initial salts are 7.20g. Let's think about the molar masses of the salts.

Assuming that each salt produces these gases.

Wait, perhaps each salt produces H2O, CO, and H2 upon heating. Let me think about what kind of salts would do that.

For example, suppose the salts are metal carbonyls, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that upon heating, they decompose to metal oxides, CO, and H2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the salts are ammonium carbamates or something similar. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are like sodium bicarbonate, which upon heating produces CO2, H2O, and NaOH, but that would produce CO2, which would react in tube 2, which it didn't.

Wait, perhaps the salts are copper(II) carbonate hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into CuO, CO2, and H2O. But again, CO2 would have reacted in tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible formulas of the salts and what their decomposition products are.

Wait, let's think about the gases. The gases are H2O, CO, and H2. Let's figure out what salts would produce these upon heating.

Consider the decomposition of a metal carbonyl, but I'm not familiar enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that they contain both carbonate and another component, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the salts are sodium formate or something else. Alternatively, maybe they're metal oxides with carbonate groups.

Alternatively, think about the reaction for each salt.

Let me consider the possible decomposition of a salt into H2O, CO, and H2. For example, a metal bicarbonate might decompose into CO2, H2O, and the metal hydroxide, but that would produce CO2, which reacts with tube 2, which it didn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are something like sodium azide, but that produces N2, which doesn't react in tube 2.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the standpoint of the total moles of each gas and the mass of the salts.

Total mass of salts is 7.20g. The moles of H2O is 0.2, CO 0.05, H2 0.1. So total moles of gases are 0.35.

Assuming that the salts decompose completely into these gases, perhaps each mole of salt produces a certain amount of these gases.

Wait, but it's more likely that each salt contributes to the gases. Let's suppose that each salt is a binary salt, perhaps of the formula M(CO)x(H2)yOz, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt upon decomposition produces H2O, CO, and H2 in particular molar ratios.

Wait, let's think about the gases. The total moles of H2O is 0.2, which is the highest. Let's think about hydrogen and carbon in the salts.

The H2O has 0.2*(2H +1O) = 0.4 H and 0.2 O.

CO has 0.05*(1C +1O) = 0.05 C and 0.05 O.

H2 has 0.1*(2H) = 0.2 H.

So total H from all gases: 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 mol.

Total C: 0.05 mol.

Total O: 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.

So the salts must have provided these amounts of H, C, and O.

Now, the salts are composed of some metal(s) and these elements.

Assuming that the salts are metal carbonates or bicarbonates, but earlier analysis suggested that would produce CO2, which didn't react in tube 2, which it should have.

Alternatively, maybe the salts contain both carbonate and bicarbonate groups, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of the form MCOOH (metal formate), which upon heating might decompose into CO, H2O, and the metal oxide.

Wait, let's take sodium formate (NaHCOO) as an example. When heated, sodium formate decomposes into sodium oxide (Na2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and water (H2O). The reaction would be:

2 NaHCOO → Na2O + CO + H2O.

So per 2 moles of NaHCOO, we get 1 mole of Na2O, 1 mole of CO, and 1 mole of H2O.

So, the molar ratio of CO and H2O would be 1:1, which in our case, CO is 0.05 and H2O is 0.2, which is a ratio of 1:4. So perhaps each salt produces more H2O than CO.

Wait, but in our case, the H2O is 0.2 and CO is 0.05, so a ratio of 4:1.

So if I have a salt that produces 4 moles of H2O for each mole of CO, perhaps something like MCOOH decomposing into M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is: MCOOH → M(OH) + CO + H2O.

Wait, but that's not a balanced equation. Let me try to balance it.

Let me assume the decomposition of MCOOH: suppose it's

MCOOH → M(OH) + CO + H2O.

But let's balance:

M: 1 on each side.

C: 1 on each side.

O on left: 2 (from MCOOH) + O from OH, CO, H2O.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the decomposition reaction.

Let me think of MCOOH decomposing into M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

The reaction would be: 2 MCOOH → M(OH)2 + 2 CO + H2O.

Let's count atoms:

Left: 2 M, 2 C, 2*(O in COOH: 2 O) → 4 O, plus 2 H (from COOH).

Right: M, 2 O (from OH2), 2 C (from CO), 2 O (from CO) + 2 H and 1 O (from H2O). So O total is 2 (from OH2) + 2*1 (CO) + 1 (H2O) = 5 O.

Wait, perhaps this isn't balancing. Alternatively, maybe the decomposition produces H2 gas as well. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition of MCOOH produces M, CO, and H2O, and H2.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is more complex. Another possibility is that the salt is a metal hydrous carbonate, like MgCO3·H2O, which upon heating decomposes into MgO, CO2, and H2O. But that would produce CO2, which would react in tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of the formula MCOO M'OH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the salts are sodium bicarbonate, but that would produce CO2, which would have reacted in tube 2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the total elements in the salts and the gases.

The salts contain M (metal), and perhaps O, C, H.

The gases are H2O (H, O), CO (C, O), H2 (H). So the salts must contain C, H, O, and the metal(s).

Now, the salts are equimolar, each with n moles. So total moles of each salt is n, so 2n moles in total.

Total mass of salts: 7.20g = 2n × (molar mass).

The molar mass of each salt would be M = sum of atomic masses of all atoms in the formula.

Our goal is to find the total number of atoms in each salt. Let's say each salt has a formula with a certain number of atoms. For example, if each salt has a formula like M(CO)x(H2O)y, then each unit would have 1 M, x C, x O, y H, and y O.

Wait, but perhaps each salt is of the formula MCOOH, which is formate. Let's think about that.

If each salt is MCOOH, which upon heating gives M(OH), CO, and H2O. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the ratio of H2O to CO is 4:1 in the gases.

So, let's try to model this.

Suppose each mole of salt A and B produces a certain amount of the gases.

Let me denote salt A as MCOOH. When heated, it decomposes as:

2 MCOOH → M(OH)2 + CO + H2O.

Wait, let me balance this equation.

Left side: 2 MCOOH → 2 M, 2 C, 4 O, 2 H.

Right side: M(OH)2 → M, 2 O, 2 H.

CO → C, O.

H2O → 2 H, O.

So, let's balance:

- M: 2 on left, 1 on right → multiply M(OH)2 by 2: 2 M(OH)2 → 2 M, 4 O, 4 H.

Now, the equation becomes:

2 MCOOH → 2 M(OH)2 + CO + H2O.

Now, let's balance C and O:

Left: 2 C.

Right: 1 C (from CO) → need another C. Let's add another CO.

So:

2 MCOOH → 2 M(OH)2 + 2 CO + H2O.

Now, check O:

Left: 2 COOH → 2*(O and OH groups) → 2*(2 O) =4 O.

Right: 2 M(OH)2 → 2*(2 O) =4 O.

2 CO → 2*O = 2 O.

H2O → 1 O.

Total O on right:4 +2 +1=7 O.

Left: Each MCOOH has 2 O (from COOH: C-O-OH?), wait, wait: MCOOH is CHOO^- M^+, so each MCOOH has 2 O from COO^- and one O from OH, so 3 O per MCOOH. So 2 MCOOH → 6 O.

But on the right, we have 4 (from 2 M(OH)2) + 2*(CO: each has 1 O) → 2 O, plus H2O: 1 O → total 4+2+1=7 O.

So 2 MCOOH → 6 O on left, but right has 7 O. So we're missing one O somewhere.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the decomposition. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let me consider the decomposition of a metal formate, MCOOH, upon heating.

The decomposition reaction is:

2 MCOOH → M(OH)2 + CO ↑ + H2O(g).

Wait, let me count atoms:

M: 2 on left, 1 on right → not balanced.

C: 2 on left, 1 on right → not balanced.

O: let's see, each MCOOH has 3 O (C=O-OH?), so 2 MCOOH → 6 O.

On the right: M(OH)2 → 2 O. CO → 1 O. H2O → 1 O. Total O: 2 +1 +1=4. So 6 O on left, 4 on right. Not balanced.

So, perhaps the reaction needs to have more CO or more H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

4 MCOOH → 2 M(OH)2 + 3 CO + H2O.

Let me check:

M: 4 → 2 → not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find a balanced equation elsewhere or think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt A is sodium carbonate, which upon heating produces Na2O, CO2, and H2O. But that would produce CO2, which would have reacted in tube 2, leading to a mass change, which didn't happen.

I'm stuck on the exact decomposition products. Maybe I should try another approach.

Let me think about the moles of each element in the salts. The total moles of H, C, and O in the salts must equal the moles present in the gases.

Wait, the gases have:

H: 0.6 moles.

C: 0.05 moles.

O: 0.25 moles.

Now, the salts have some formula containing these elements plus metal(s). Let's assume that the salts are of the form M(CO)x(OH)y. Then, each mole of salt would contribute x CO, y H2O, etc.

But perhaps each salt contributes a certain ratio of the gases. Let me think that each salt, when heated, produces a certain amount of H2O, CO, and H2.

Wait, perhaps each salt produces a certain number of H2O, CO, and H2. Let's model each salt as producing a specific number of moles of these gases.

But without knowing the exact decomposition, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the salts are composed of a metal, carbon, and hydrogen, with oxygen as part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the salts are ammonium salts, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of the formula MCOOH (metal formate), which upon heating decomposes into metal oxide, CO, and H2O.

But earlier attempts to balance the equation didn't work out, so perhaps it's better to consider that each mole of salt produces 0.4 moles of H2O, 0.1 moles of CO, and 0.2 moles of H2.

Wait, but the total from the gases is 0.2 H2O, 0.05 CO, and 0.1 H2.

So, in terms of moles per salt, perhaps each salt produces 0.1 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of CO, and 0.05 moles of H2. Since there are two salts in equimolar amounts, the total would be 0.2, 0.05, and 0.1.

But how does that translate into the formula of the salts?

Alternatively, perhaps each salt produces 0.1 moles of H2O, 0.025 moles of CO, and 0.05 moles of H2 per mole.

Wait, maybe each salt produces a certain ratio of the gases. Let's say each mole of salt produces a moles of H2O, b moles of CO, and c moles of H2.

So, for two salts (n moles each), total would be 2n a =0.2, 2n b=0.05, 2n c=0.1.

So:

a = 0.2/(2n) = 0.1/n.

b = 0.05/(2n) = 0.025/n.

c =0.1/(2n)=0.05/n.

But without knowing n, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the salts produce the gases in a certain molar ratio, such as 4 H2O : 1 CO : 2 H2.

In that case, the ratio would be 4:1:2.

So, for every 4 moles of H2O, there's 1 mole of CO and 2 of H2.

In our case, H2O is 0.2, CO 0.05, H2 0.1. Let's check the ratios:

0.2 (H2O) : 0.05 (CO) : 0.1 (H2) → 4:1:2.

Yes, that matches. So the ratio is 4:1:2.

Therefore, each mole of salt produces 4 moles of H2O, 1 mole of CO, and 2 moles of H2.

Wait, but that would mean that each salt produces these gases in a 4:1:2 ratio. So, for each mole of salt, 4 H2O, 1 CO, 2 H2.

So, for two salts (each n moles), total would be 8n H2O, 2n CO, 4n H2.

Wait, but in our case, the totals are 0.2, 0.05, 0.1. So:

8n =0.2 → n=0.025.

2n=0.05 → n=0.025.

4n=0.1 → n=0.025.

Yes, that works. So each salt is 0.025 moles. So total moles of salts is 2 * 0.025 = 0.05 moles.

But the total mass of salts is 7.20g. So each mole of salt has a molar mass of 7.20g /0.05 mol = 144 g/mol.

So each salt has a molar mass of 144 g/mol.

Now, each salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2 per mole. Let's find out the formula of the salt.

Each mole of salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2.

Wait, the decomposition reaction could be:

Salt → products + gases.

But perhaps the salt can be considered as a combination of the gases and some metal oxide.

Wait, perhaps the salt is a hydrate, like M(CO)_something·nH2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition reaction is:

M(CO)_x (OH)_y → M oxide + CO + H2O.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the elements involved.

Each H2O molecule has 2 H and 1 O.

Each CO has 1 C and 1 O.

Each H2 has 2 H.

So, per mole of salt:

H2O:4 → 4*(2H + O) → 8 H and 4 O.

CO:1 → 1 C and 1 O.

H2:2 → 4 H.

Total per mole of salt:

C:1.

O:4 (from H2O) +1 (from CO) =5 O.

H:8 (from H2O) +4 (from H2) =12 H.

So, per mole of salt: 1 C, 12 H, 5 O.

Assuming the salt is of the form M(CO)(H2O)_something.

Wait, but the decomposition would produce M as an oxide. Let me think about the metal.

Assume the metal is M, and the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_something·something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, which would give:

M:1.

CO:1 → C:1, O:1.

H2O:4 → H:8, O:4.

So per mole: C:1, H:8, O:5.

But earlier, per mole of salt, we have C:1, H:12, O:5.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4 plus something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2. But that would be a bit odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_4. Then, upon decomposition, it would produce M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

Wait, but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2O. Then, upon decomposition, it would lose H2O as gas, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_4 → upon heating, produces M(OH)2, CO, and H2O.

But, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the elements.

Each mole of the salt contains 1 C, 12 H, 5 O, and the metal M.

So the formula could be M(CO)(H2O)_4. Let's check:

M(CO)(H2O)_4 → M, CO, 4 H2O.

Which would give:

C:1.

O:1 (from CO) +4*(O from H2O) → 5 O.

H: 4*2 =8 H.

But earlier, per mole of salt, we have 12 H. So perhaps there's more H.

Ah, wait, the H2 gas suggests that there's more H in the salt. So, perhaps the salt has H2O plus H2 in the decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2.

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition also produces H2 gas, which comes from the salt's structure.

Wait, another approach: Since each mole of salt produces 2 moles of H2, which is 4 H atoms, then the salt must have 4 H atoms per mole that are released as H2. So, perhaps the salt has 4 H atoms as H2 in its structure.

Additionally, the H2O contributes 8 H atoms per mole of salt.

So, total H in salt: 8 (from H2O) + 4 (from H2) =12 H per mole of salt.

So, the salt's formula includes 12 H, 1 C, 5 O, and the metal M.

So, the formula could be MCOOH4, which is M(COOH)4, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps it's M(CO)(H2O)4.

Wait, but M(CO)(H2O)4 would have:

C:1.

O:1 (CO) + 4*(O from H2O) =5 O.

H: 8 H.

So, not enough H. We need 12 H per mole.

So, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)4·H2.

But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)4·H2O, which would add another H2O, giving:

H: 8 + 2 =10 H.

Still not enough.

Wait, perhaps the salt is M(CO)(H2O)4·H2. Then:

H from H2O:4 *2 =8.

H from H2:2.

Total H:10. Still not 12.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2O.

Then H from H2O is 4*2 +2*2=12 H.

Yes! So, the formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2O → M(CO)(H2O)_6.

Wait, but then:

H from H2O:6 *2 =12 H.

So, in that case, the formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_6.

Which would give:

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +6*(O from H2O)=7 O.

But earlier, per mole of salt, we have 5 O. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead think about the total atoms in the salt.

Each salt has a formula that includes 1 C, 12 H, 5 O, and the metal M.

The formula could be MCO(OH)4, which would be:

M:1.

C:1.

O: (from CO:1) + (from OH in each of 4 groups:4) → 5 O.

H: (4 *1) from OH groups →4 H.

But wait, that's only 4 H, but we need 12 H per mole. So that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O. Then:

H from H2O:4*2 +2 =10 H.

Not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps it's M(CO)(H2O)_6, which gives H:6*2=12.

O:1 (from CO) +6 (from H2O) =7 O.

But earlier, per mole of salt, O is 5. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I thought that each mole of salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2.

So, per mole of salt:

H2O:4 → H:8, O:4.

CO:1 → C:1, O:1.

H2:2 → H:4.

So total per mole of salt:

C:1.

H:8+4=12.

O:4+1=5.

So, the formula must include C, H, O, and M.

Perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would mean:

H from H2O:4 *2=8.

H from H2:2.

Total H:10.

Not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Which would give H: 4*2 + 4 =12.

O:4 (from H2O) +1 (CO) =5.

Yes! So formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual. Let me check:

M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2 → upon heating, this would decompose into M, CO, H2O, and H2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

But that's 12 H, 5 O, and 1 C per mole.

So, the formula would be M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

So, the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which can be written as M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2 → M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

But this seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps it's M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O, but that would give O=6, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else.

But perhaps it's better to think of the formula as M(CO)(H2O)_4· H2, which would give the required H and O.

So, the molar mass of the salt would be:

M (metal) + (CO) + 4*(H2O) + (H2).

So, M + (12 +16) + 4*(2+16) + (2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

So, M is the molar mass of the metal.

CO has a molar mass of 12 + 16 =28 g/mol.

Each H2O is 2 +16 =18 g/mol. Four of them →4*18=72.

H2 is 2 g/mol.

So total molar mass: M + 28 +72 +2 = M +102.

But earlier, we determined that the molar mass of each salt is 144 g/mol.

So, M +102 =144 → M=42 g/mol.

Wait, which metal has an atomic mass of 42? Let me think: titanium is about 48, magnesium is 24.38, sodium is 23, aluminum is 27, potassium is 39, calcium is 40, zinc is 65. Hmm, 42 isn't a common metal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else. Maybe M(CO)(H2O)_4· H2O.

Then, the molar mass would be M +28 +4*(18) +18 = M +28+72+18= M+118.

Set equal to 144 → M=26 g/mol. So, M would be iron? No, iron is ~56. Wait, 26 is close to magnesium (24.3), which is about 24.3.

So, M=24.3 g/mol → Mg.

So, the formula would be Mg(CO)(H2O)_4· H2O.

Wait, but that's:

Mg:24.3.

CO:28.

4 H2O:4*18=72.

H2O:18.

Total:24.3 +28 +72 +18= 142.3 g/mol, which is close to 144. So perhaps that's the salt.

But alternatively, perhaps the formula is Mg(CO)(H2O)_4 · H2.

Which would be:

24.3 +28 +4*18 +2 =24.3+28+72+2=126.3 g/mol. Not close to 144.

Hmm, perhaps the formula isn't including H2, but perhaps the H2 comes from the decomposition of the H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is MgCOOH·4 H2O, which is magnesium formate tetrahydrate.

The molecular formula would be Mg(COOH)·4 H2O.

Which can be written as Mg(COOH)·4 H2O → Mg(COOH)·4 H2O.

Decomposing this upon heating could produce MgO, CO, and H2O, along with H2.

Wait, let me think about the decomposition:

Mg(COOH)·4 H2O → MgO + CO ↑ + H2O(g) + H2 ↑.

But I'm not sure if that's a balanced equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition reaction is:

2 Mg(COOH)·4 H2O → 2 MgO + 2 CO + 8 H2O + H2.

But this is just a guess, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition produces MgO, CO, H2O, and H2.

But without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to proceed. However, the key point is that each salt has a molar mass of 144 g/mol, and the formula includes C, H, O, and Mg.

But I'm not making much progress on the exact formula. Maybe I should move to the calculation of the total number of atoms.

Each salt has a formula that includes M, C, H, and O atoms.

Assuming the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something, but perhaps the exact formula isn't necessary for the total number of atoms.

Each salt has:

- 1 M atom.

- 1 C from CO.

- 4 H2O groups → 4*(2 H and 1 O) → 8 H and 4 O.

Plus, perhaps additional H and O from other components.

Wait, based on earlier analysis, each mole of salt has 1 C, 12 H, 5 O, and 1 M.

So, the formula could be M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something, but the exact formula isn't necessary for the atom count.

Each salt has 1 M atom, 1 C atom, 12 H atoms, and 5 O atoms.

So, the total number of atoms per salt is 1 (M) +1 (C) +12 (H) +5 (O) =19 atoms.

Wait, but wait:

M:1.

C:1.

H:12.

O:5.

Total:19 atoms per formula unit.

So, each salt has 19 atoms. Since there are two salts (A and B) in equimolar amounts, each contributing 19 atoms, the total number of atoms is 19 *2 =38.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 13,19,17,15.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps each salt has fewer atoms. Let me recount.

If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, then:

M:1.

CO:1 C, 1 O.

Each H2O:2 H, 1 O.

Four H2O:8 H,4 O.

So, total per mole of salt:

M:1.

C:1.

H:8.

O:1 +4=5.

So, 1+1+8+5=15 atoms.

Wait, 1 (M) +1 (C) +8 (H) +5 (O) =15 atoms.

Ah, so each salt has 15 atoms. Since there are two salts (A and B), each with 15 atoms, total atoms would be 15 *2 =30. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but the salts are equimolar, but perhaps each salt has a different formula. Wait, the problem states that it's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, each with the same molar amount. So, if each salt contributes 15 atoms, then two salts would contribute 30 atoms. But the options don't have 30, so something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps each salt has a different number of atoms. For example, salt A has 15 atoms, salt B has 17, making a total of 32. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the total atoms per salt. Let me re-express.

If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, then the formula is MCO(H2O)_4.

So, each formula unit has:

M:1.

C:1.

O from CO:1.

Each H2O:2 H,1 O.

Four H2O: 8 H,4 O.

So, per formula unit:

M:1.

C:1.

H:8.

O:1 +4=5.

Total atoms:1+1+8+5=15.

So each salt has 15 atoms. Two salts would have 30 atoms. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the H2 as part of the salt, like M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Then, the formula would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:5.

H:8 (from H2O) +2 (from H2) =10.

Wait, no, earlier I thought each mole of salt produces 2 moles of H2, which is 4 H, but per mole of H2, it's 2 H. So 2 moles of H2 would be 4 H per mole of salt.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between moles and atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has a formula that includes all the elements except the metal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would include:

M:1.

C:1.

O:5.

H:8 (from H2O) +2 (from H2) =10.

So, per formula unit: M, C, 10 H, 5 O.

Total atoms:1+1+10+5=17.

So each salt has 17 atoms. Two salts would have 34 atoms, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm, the options given are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, making the total 34. But 34 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O.

Which would be:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) +1 (additional H2O) =6 O.

H:8 (from H2O) + 2 (from H2) =10 H.

So per formula unit:1+1+10+6=18 atoms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_3·H2.

Then:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 +3*1=4.

H:3*2=6 + 2=8.

Total atoms:1+1+8+4=14.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_2·H2.

Then:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 +2=3.

H:4 +2=6.

Total atoms:1+1+6+3=11. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

Each salt produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2.

So, per mole of salt:

H2O:4 → H:8, O:4.

CO:1 → C:1, O:1.

H2:2 → H:4.

Total H:12, C:1, O:5.

Assuming the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) =5 O.

H:8 (H2O) + 2 (H2) =10 H.

Wait, but that gives H:10, but we need 12 H per mole. So perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Which would give H:8 +4=12.

O:1+4=5.

So, formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2.

Which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:5.

H:12.

So, total atoms per formula unit:1+1+12+5=19.

Ah! So each salt has 19 atoms. Since there are two salts (A and B) in equimolar amounts, each contributing 19 atoms, the total is 19 *2=38 atoms.

But the options don't include 38. Hmm.

Wait, but the question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. So each salt has 19 atoms, two salts would have 38. But the options don't have 38, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2, giving 10 H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else.

Wait, maybe the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O, which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 +1=6.

H:8 +2=10.

So, 1+1+10+6=18.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms. Let's see: 1 M, 1 C, 8 H, 7 O.

Wait, where would 7 O come from? If formula is M(CO)(H2O)_6, then O:1 +6=7.

H:6*2=12.

So, formula is M(CO)(H2O)_6.

Which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:7.

H:12.

Total atoms:1+1+12+7=21.

No, that's 21.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is 17, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the salts as metal bicarbonates, which upon heating produce CO2, H2O, and the metal oxide. But earlier analysis suggests that wouldn't fit because CO2 would have reacted in tube 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that each mole produces 4 H2O, 1 CO, and 2 H2, and the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would give 19 atoms per salt, as before.

But since the options don't include 38, perhaps the correct answer is 17, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O, which would have:

M:1.

C:1.

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) +1 (H2O) =6.

H:8 (H2O) +2 (H2) +2 (H2O) =12.

So, 1+1+12+6=20.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·2 H2O, giving:

O:1 +4 +2=7.

H:8 +4=12.

So, 1+1+12+7=21.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something that doesn't add H or O, like another CO. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else, but I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the option that matches 19, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are:

A)13

B)19

C)17

D)15

If each salt has 19 atoms, the total would be 38, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms. Let me recount.

If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something with 2 H2O and 1 H2.

Which would give:

H:8 (H2O) +2 (H2) =10.

But earlier analysis says we need 12 H per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something else that adds 2 H.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O·H2.

Which would give:

O:1 (CO) +4 (H2O) +1 (H2O) =6.

H:8 (H2O) +2 (H2) +2 (H2O) =12.

So, 1+1+12+6=20.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O.

Which would have:

O:1 +4 +1=6.

H:8 +2=10.

So, 1+1+10+6=18.

Not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck on this part. Given the options, I think the correct answer is 17, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms.

Wait, another approach: the molar mass of the salt is 144 g/mol. If the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4· something, and the metal is Mg (24.3 g/mol), then:

CO:28.

4 H2O:4*(18)=72.

Total so far:24.3 +28 +72=124.3.

To reach 144, the remaining is 144-124.3=19.7g/mol, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the formula isn't Mg-based.

Alternatively, if the metal is Na (23), then:

23 +28 +72=123.

144-123=21g/mol left. That could be H2O (18) and H2 (2), totaling 20, which is close. So, perhaps the formula is Na(CO)(H2O)_4·H2O·H2.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Na(CO)(H2O)_4·H2.

Which would be:

23 +28 +72 +2=125.

144-125=19g/mol. Doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C)17 or B)19.

But considering that each salt has 17 atoms, the total for two salts would be 34, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, and the answer is option C)17. But the total atoms would be 17 *2=34, which isn't an option, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the problem asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which are a mixture. So perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, making the total 17 *2=34, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 17 atoms, but the question asks for the sum of all atoms in A and B, which would be 17 + another 17 =34, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has 15 atoms. The total would be 30, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M(CO)(H2O)_4, which has 15 atoms, so two salts would have 30. But again, no option.

I'm stuck. Considering the options, I think the correct answer is B)19, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves determining the total number of atoms in an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which weigh 7.20 g in total. Upon heating, the salts produce a mixture of gases: H₂O, CO, and H₂. These gases are analyzed using three tubes:

1. **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: The mass increases by 3.60 g, indicating the absorption of H₂O. The moles of H₂O are calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = \frac{3.60}{18} = 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: The weight remains unchanged, indicating no reaction with CO₂ or SO₂, implying the gas does not contain these substances.

3. **Tube №3 (Red-hot Cu)**: The mass increases by 0.80 g, and CuO is formed. This suggests the gas contains CO, as CO reacts with Cu to form CuO. The moles of CO are calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = \frac{0.80}{16} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

The remaining gas after all tubes is 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP), corresponding to:

   \[
   \text{Moles of gas C} = \frac{2.24}{22.4} = 0.1 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

### Analysis of the Gases
- **H₂O**: 0.2 mol.
- **CO**: 0.05 mol.
- **H₂**: 0.1 mol (remaining gas).

The total moles of gases produced are:

   \[
   0.2 + 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.35 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

### Determining the Formula of the Salts
The salts decompose to produce H₂O, CO, and H₂. Assuming the salts are equimolar and produce these gases in a specific molar ratio, the decomposition reaction can be modeled as:

   \[
   \text{Salt} \rightarrow \text{Metal oxide} + \text{CO} + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2.
   \]

From the gas moles, the ratio of H₂O to CO to H₂ is **4:1:2**. This implies each mole of salt produces 4 moles of H₂O, 1 mole of CO, and 2 moles of H₂.

### Molar Mass of the Salts
The total mass of the salts is 7.20 g, and they are equimolar. Let the number of moles of each salt be \( n \). The total moles of salts are \( 2n \), and their molar mass is:

   \[
   \text{Molar mass of each salt} = \frac{7.20}{2n}.
   \]

From the gas stoichiometry, each mole of salt contributes 1 C, 12 H, and 5 O (from H₂O and CO). Assuming the salt contains a metal \( M \), the formula can be represented as \( M(\text{CO})(\text{H}_2\text{O})_4 \). The molar mass of the salt is:

   \[
   M + 28 + 4 \times 18 = M + 92.
   \]

Given the molar mass of the salt is 144 g/mol:

   \[
   M + 92 = 144 \implies M = 52 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

This corresponds to the metal **Mg** (atomic mass ≈ 24.3 g/mol), suggesting the salt might be magnesium-based.

### Total Number of Atoms in the Salts
Each salt has the formula \( M(\text{CO})(\text{H}_2\text{O})_4 \), which contains:

- 1 \( M \) atom,
- 1 C atom,
- 8 H atoms (from \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \)),
- 5 O atoms (1 from CO and 4 from \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \)).

Thus, each salt contains:

   \[
   1 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 15 \, \text{atoms}.
   \]

Since the salts are equimolar, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is:

   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30.
   \]

However, this does not match the provided options. Reassessing the formula, if the salt includes additional hydrogen or oxygen, the total number of atoms could increase. Given the options, the most plausible answer is **19 atoms per salt**, leading to a total of 38 atoms for both salts. Since this is not an option, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**
