Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. I think SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian while maintaining some underlying symmetries.

Wait, which symmetries are part of the Standard Model? The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries, right? So if the Standard Model includes the Poincare group, then SMEFT must also respect that because it's an effective theory built from SM principles.

But wait, the operators in SMEFT are beyond the SM, but they must still be compatible with the SM's symmetries. So I think all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. That would mean Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely one.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Since Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetries of the SM, SMEFT operators should also respect that. So I think 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry (3). I remember that the SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but certain operators can violate CP. For example, the CKM matrix in the Standard Model leads to CP violation. So SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, right? So CP symmetry doesn't have to be respected by all operators. Therefore, point 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that all SMEFT operators must obey.

Then there's CPT symmetry (4). I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories because of the spin-statistics theorem and other considerations. So any operator in a consistent quantum field theory should respect CPT symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must preserve CPT symmetry. So point 4 is correct.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Wait, but wait a second. Are Lorentz and Poincare separate symmetries? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So do I need to consider both 1 and 2 as separate required symmetries, or is Poincare a subset?

Wait, the question is about which must be respected. So if an operator is Poincare invariant, it must also be Lorentz invariant. So if the question is about which symmetries are required, would both 1 and 2 be correct, or is Poincare a more comprehensive symmetry that already includes Lorentz, making the correct answer include 2?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering whether both Lorentz and Poincare are separate symmetries that must be respected. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So does the question require both, or is it sufficient that Poincare is there?

I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to respect all SM gauge symmetries and to be Poincare invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required. Or perhaps Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of what the SMEFT requires. SMEFT is based on the Standard Model, which itself is a Poincare-invariant theory. So all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which in turn implies Lorentz symmetry. So the question is whether the answer includes both 1 and 2 or just 2.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. So the question is whether all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

Wait, another approach: which symmetries are part of the Standard Model? The Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. So any effective theory derived from it should also be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct. So if the options include both, that's correct.

But wait, is Poincare symmetry really a separate symmetry that needs to be considered? Because the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it must be Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected, 1 and 2 would both need to be correct, but in reality, respecting Poincare automatically ensures Lorentz symmetry.

So are they both required, or is Poincare the higher-level symmetry and thus the main one that must be respected, making Lorentz a subset?

Wait, maybe the question is testing whether all operators must be Poincare-invariant, which would include Lorentz. But the options give 1 and 2 as separate. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, because the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are required to respect Poincare symmetry, which automatically includes Lorentz, so only point 2 is needed. But I think the correct answer includes both 1 and 2 because they're separate aspects.

Wait, but in reality, the Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. So the question is whether the operator must respect both.

But perhaps the point is that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. So they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, perhaps it's redundant. So maybe only Poincare is needed, but the question includes Lorentz as a separate option.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it this way: every operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Also, since the theory is Poincare-invariant, the operators must be Poincare-invariant, which includes Lorentz and translation. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Therefore, the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are correct. What about 3 and 4?

As for CP symmetry, since the Standard Model already includes CP-violating terms, so SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. So 3 is not a symmetry that must be respected.

CPT symmetry is a bigger deal. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must be CPT-symmetric. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT. So point 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Let me check the options again:

Option C: 1,2,4 → which is Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember if SMEFT requires CPT symmetry. Since the SM is CPT symmetric, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from SM, yes, all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So the correct answer would include 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. The question says which must be respected by all operators. So, which of the four symmetries must each operator obey.

So, for each operator, must it respect Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and/or CPT?

So, operators must be Poincare-invariant, which implies they're Lorentz-invariant. So 2 implies 1. So the correct answer would include 2, but I'm not sure if the options have that.

But the options are 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.

Because Poincare (2) is about the full symmetry, including Lorentz, but perhaps the question is considering Lorentz as a separate symmetry. So if an operator must be a Lorentz scalar, then 1 is correct. But also, the operator must be Poincare-invariant, which includes Lorentz and translations. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Hence, if the options include 1 and 2, that's correct. So the correct answer would be C) 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that if you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz. So perhaps including 2 already covers 1, but the question lists them as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

So to recap: All operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the answer is option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** The Standard Model and SMEFT are Lorentz-invariant, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This symmetry includes transformations like rotations and boosts.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since the Standard Model and SMEFT are Poincaré-invariant, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry, as Poincaré symmetry includes it.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already includes CP-violating terms (e.g., from the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, required by the spin-statistics theorem and other considerations. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Wait, but wait. The question says which must be respected by all operators. So, which of the four symmetries must each operator obey.

So, for each operator, must it respect Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and/or CPT?

So, operators must be Poincare-invariant, which implies they're Lorentz-invariant. So 2 implies 1. So the correct answer would include 2, but I'm not sure if the options have that.

Because Poincare (2) is about the full symmetry, including Lorentz, but perhaps the question is considering Lorentz as a separate symmetry.
