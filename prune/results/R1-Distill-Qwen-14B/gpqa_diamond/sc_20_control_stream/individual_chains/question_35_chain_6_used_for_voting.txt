Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. 

Wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, S is probably related to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall the Pauli matrices. The first one, σ_x, is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, so S looks like σ_y because the first row is [0, -i], and second is [i,0]. So S is indeed the Pauli y-matrix.

So A_y is c multiplied by σ_y. And c is h/(4π). But wait, another thing I remember: the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So, for σ_y, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Therefore, when I multiply by c, the eigenvalues of A_y should be c*(±1). Let's compute that: c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π))*(-1). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention h/(4π) as the eigenvalues. Let's check the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary or real? Wait, no. Oh wait, no. Wait, S is σ_y, which is a Hermitian matrix. So A_y is c times a Hermitian matrix. So A_y should be Hermitian as well, right? Because c is a real constant. So the eigenvalues should be real, right? Because Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, S is not Hermitian. Because S is σ_y? Let me check. σ_y is Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Because the (1,2) element is -i, and the (2,1) is i, so conjugate transpose would flip the signs of the imaginary parts. Let's compute. σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i],[-i, 0]]. Which is the negative of σ_y. Oh wait, so σ_y is actually anti-Hermitian? Because σ_y† = -σ_y. So S is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. Therefore, A_y = c S would be anti-Hermitian. Because c is real and S is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, anti-Hermitian means that (A_y)† = -A_y. That would imply that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Because for an anti-Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues are imaginary. So that's important.

So the eigenvalues of A_y would be purely imaginary. Because A_y is anti-Hermitian. So when I calculate the eigenvalues of A_y, they should be purely imaginary.

Earlier, I thought the eigenvalues of S (σ_y) are ±1, but wait, if S is anti-Hermitian, then its eigenvalues are imaginary. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So σ_y is Hermitian. Oh wait, because σ_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real. But wait, I thought earlier that σ_y is anti-Hermitian, but that's not correct. Let me recheck.

The Pauli matrices are indeed Hermitian. So σ_y is Hermitian, meaning σ_y† = σ_y. So for σ_y, the (2,1) element is i, and the (1,2) is -i. So, the conjugate transpose would swap these, but also take the complex conjugate. So, for element (1,2), it's -i → becomes i, so the (2,1) element in the transpose. Wait, let me compute σ_y†:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

σ_y† is the conjugate transpose:

First row: [0, i] (because (0,0) is 0, (0,1) is i (the conjugate of (1,0) which is i))
Second row: [-i, 0] (because (1,0) is -i, (1,1) is 0)

Wait, that's not the same as σ_y. So σ_y† is not equal to σ_y. So that contradicts what I thought. So perhaps σ_y is not Hermitian? But I'm pretty sure the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me compute σ_y again. Oh wait, no. I think I made a mistake. Let me write σ_y correctly. The Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, σ_y† would be taking the transpose and the complex conjugate of each element. The transpose of σ_y is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then take the complex conjugate of each element: 0 stays 0, i becomes -i, -i becomes i. So σ_y† is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as σ_y. So σ_y is Hermitian. Oh, okay, I messed up my earlier calculation. So σ_y is Hermitian. So then A_y is c * σ_y, so Hermitian operator. So the eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. So when I multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Looking again at the options. Let's look at option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real are ±1. No, because the eigenvalues are real. So the imaginary parts are zero, but the options say otherwise. So not B.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So the real parts would be h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because the imaginary parts are not ±2πh.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. The square of the angular momentum operator (A²) commutes with the components. So the eigenfunctions of A² and any component, say A_z, would form a complete set. But if a function is an eigenfunction of A_y, would it be an eigenfunction of A²? Well, A² is the square of the vector operator, which would involve A_x, A_y, A_z. But for a spin-1/2 particle, A² would have eigenvalues (h²)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalues h²*(1/2)(3/2) = 3h²/4. So, any eigenstate of A_y would be an eigenstate of A² because the total angular momentum squared commutes with any component. So, if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, then A² φ = (3h²/4) φ. So, yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? A_y and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but not of Az, which is also correct. So option C seems correct. Let's see the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions would be the eigenvectors of Ay. So if φ is an eigenvector (eigenfunction), then yes, they form a basis. But I'm not sure if the statement is correct. The question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think this is true because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space when the operator is diagonalizable, which it is, since it's 2x2 and has two eigenvalues. So the eigenvectors would form a basis. But I'm not certain if option D is correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y. The eigenvalues are ±1, so A_y has eigenvalues ±c, where c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, as we thought earlier.

So the eigenvalues are real, which means the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Now, the eigenvectors would be functions (vectors) in a 2D space. Since S is σ_y, which has eigenvectors like [1, i] and [1, -i], but scaled appropriately.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvectors of S = σ_y.

For eigenvalue +1: (S - I) v = 0.

S - I = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]

So the equations are:

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvectors can be written as [ -i v2, v2 ]^T, which can be simplified by choosing v2 = 1. So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T. Alternatively, to make it a unit vector, divide by sqrt(|-i|^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +1) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2)) [ -i, 1 ]^T and (1/sqrt(2)) [ i, 1 ]^T for the eigenvalues -1 and +1, respectively? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, for S, the eigenvalue +1: equation (S - I)v = 0.

So v = [v1, v2]^T.

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (-i) v2 = (1) v1 → Wait, no. Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S - I is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

So equation 1: -v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

Equation 2: i v1 - v2 =0. Substituting v1 from equation 1: i*(-i v2) - v2 = (-i^2) v2 -v2 → (-(-1)) v2 -v2 = v2 -v2 =0. So equation 2 is satisfied. So eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but that's for S. Since A_y = c S, the eigenvectors of A_y should be the same as those of S, because they are scalar multiples. So the eigenvectors are the same. So the eigenfunctions (which are the eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, which is 2D. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So that's correct. So D is correct? Or is it that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator?

Wait, the matrix operator is represented in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are functions in that basis. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, yes. So option D's statement is correct.

So the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so any eigenstate of Ay is also of A². But they don't commute with Az, so eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator. So both C and D could be correct, but let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So which options are correct?

Let's reevaluate each option:

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct as well because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis for the operator.

So both C and D are correct statements. But wait, the options are presented as which statement is correct, implying only one is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about option D. The question says: 'the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.' So, the matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis (probably computational basis). The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthogonal basis for the space, but not necessarily the same as the standard basis. So, the statement in D is correct, as the eigenvectors are a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis for the operator.

But wait, the standard basis is different. The standard basis is [1,0] and [0,1]. The eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So the statement D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

But wait, the question is phrased as: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So, perhaps this is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the operator is diagonal. The matrix representation in this eigenbasis would be diagonal, but the given matrix is in the standard basis.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of linear algebra. The matrix S is represented in the standard basis. The eigenvectors of S form a different basis. So the statement D says that the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. I think that the operator is represented in the standard basis, not in the eigenbasis. So the basis functions of the operator would be the standard basis vectors. So, the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis functions. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are (probably) not the same as the standard basis functions. So, the statement in D would be incorrect because the basis functions of the operator (standard basis) are [1,0] and [0,1], while the eigenfunctions are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ] (after normalization), which are different. So D's statement is incorrect.

Hmm, this is tricky. So if I have to choose between the options, I think option C is correct. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az. So C is a correct statement.

Wait, why can't the eigenfunctions be eigenfunctions of Az? Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A_z? No, wait, the commutator of angular momentum components: [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz, etc. So [Ay, Az] = iħ A something—probably not zero. So they don't commute, so the eigenfunctions can't be shared between Ay and Az. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

So the correct statements are C and possibly D, but D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator in the standard basis.

So, the correct answer must be option C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the first row \([0, -i]\) and the second row \([i, 0]\). This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which is Hermitian. Since \( A_y \) is a scalar multiple of \( S \), it is also Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real.

The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary components. This eliminates options A and B, as both describe eigenvalues with imaginary parts, which is incorrect.

For option C, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes option C correct.

Option D states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2D space, they are not the same as the standard basis in which \( A_y \) is represented. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

The correct answer is option C, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. 

Wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, S is probably related to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall the Pauli matrices. The first one, σ_x, is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, so S looks like σ_y because the first row is [0, -i], and second is [i,0]. So S is indeed the Pauli y-matrix.

So A_y is c multiplied by σ_y. And c is h/(4π). But wait, another thing I remember: the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So, for σ_y, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Therefore, when I multiply by c, the eigenvalues of A_y should be c*(±1). Let's compute that: c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π))*(-1). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention h/(4π) as the eigenvalues. Let's check the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary or real? Wait, no. Oh wait, no. Wait, S is σ_y, which is a Hermitian matrix. So A_y is c times a Hermitian matrix. So A_y should be Hermitian as well, right? Because c is a real constant. So the eigenvalues should be real, right? Because Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, S is not Hermitian. Because S is σ_y? Let me check. σ_y is Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Because the (1,2) element is -i, and the (2,1) is i, so conjugate transpose would flip the signs of the imaginary parts. Let's compute. σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i],[-i, 0]]. Which is the negative of σ_y. Oh wait, so σ_y is actually anti-Hermitian? Because σ_y† = -σ_y. So S is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. Therefore, A_y = c S would be anti-Hermitian. Because c is real and S is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, anti-Hermitian means that (A_y)† = -A_y. That would imply that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Because for an anti-Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues are imaginary. So that's important.

So the eigenvalues of A_y would be purely imaginary. Because A_y is anti-Hermitian. So when I calculate the eigenvalues of A_y, they should be purely imaginary.

Earlier, I thought the eigenvalues of S (σ_y) are ±1, but wait, if S is anti-Hermitian, then its eigenvalues are imaginary. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So σ_y is Hermitian. Oh wait, because σ_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real. But wait, I thought earlier that σ_y is anti-Hermitian, but that's not correct. Let me recheck.

The Pauli matrices are indeed Hermitian. So σ_y is Hermitian, meaning σ_y† = σ_y. So for σ_y, the (2,1) element is i, and the (1,2) is -i. So, the conjugate transpose would swap these, but also take the complex conjugate. So, for element (1,2), it's -i → becomes i, so the (2,1) element in the transpose. Wait, let me compute σ_y†:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

σ_y† is the conjugate transpose:

First row: [0, i] (because (0,0) is 0, (0,1) is i (the conjugate of (1,0) which is i))
Second row: [-i, 0] (because (1,0) is -i, (1,1) is 0)

Wait, that's not the same as σ_y. So σ_y† is not equal to σ_y. So that contradicts what I thought. So perhaps σ_y is not Hermitian? But I'm pretty sure the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me compute σ_y again. Oh wait, no. I think I made a mistake. Let me write σ_y correctly. The Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, σ_y† would be taking the transpose and the complex conjugate of each element. The transpose of σ_y is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then take the complex conjugate of each element: 0 stays 0, i becomes -i, -i becomes i. So σ_y† is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as σ_y. So σ_y is Hermitian. Oh, okay, I messed up my earlier calculation. So σ_y is Hermitian. So then A_y is c * σ_y, so Hermitian operator. So the eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. So when I multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Looking again at the options. Let's look at option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real are ±1. No, because the eigenvalues are real. So the imaginary parts are zero, but the options say otherwise. So not B.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So the real parts would be h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because the imaginary parts are not ±2πh.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. The square of the angular momentum operator (A²) commutes with the components. So the eigenfunctions of A² and any component, say A_z, would form a complete set. But if a function is an eigenfunction of A_y, would it be an eigenfunction of A²? Well, A² is the square of the vector operator, which would involve A_x, A_y, A_z. But for a spin-1/2 particle, A² would have eigenvalues (h²)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalues h²*(1/2)(3/2) = 3h²/4. So, any eigenstate of A_y would be an eigenstate of A² because the total angular momentum squared commutes with any component. So, if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, then A² φ = (3h²/4) φ. So, yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? A_y and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but not of Az, which is also correct. So option C seems correct. Let's see the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions would be the eigenvectors of Ay. So if φ is an eigenvector (eigenfunction), then yes, they form a basis. But I'm not sure if the statement is correct. The question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think this is true because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space when the operator is diagonalizable, which it is, since it's 2x2 and has two eigenvalues. So the eigenvectors would form a basis. But I'm not certain if option D is correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y. The eigenvalues are ±1, so A_y has eigenvalues ±c, where c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, as we thought earlier.

So the eigenvalues are real, which means the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Now, the eigenvectors would be functions (vectors) in a 2D space. Since S is σ_y, which has eigenvectors like [1, i] and [1, -i], but scaled appropriately.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvectors of S = σ_y.

For eigenvalue +1: (S - I) v = 0.

S - I = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]

So the equations are:

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvectors can be written as [ -i v2, v2 ]^T, which can be simplified by choosing v2 = 1. So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T. Alternatively, to make it a unit vector, divide by sqrt(|-i|^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +1) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2)) [ -i, 1 ]^T and (1/sqrt(2)) [ i, 1 ]^T for the eigenvalues -1 and +1, respectively? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, for S, the eigenvalue +1: equation (S - I)v = 0.

So v = [v1, v2]^T.

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (-i) v2 = (1) v1 → Wait, no. Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S - I is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

So equation 1: -v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

Equation 2: i v1 - v2 =0. Substituting v1 from equation 1: i*(-i v2) - v2 = (-i^2) v2 -v2 → (-(-1)) v2 -v2 = v2 -v2 =0. So equation 2 is satisfied. So eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but that's for S. Since A_y = c S, the eigenvectors of A_y should be the same as those of S, because they are scalar multiples. So the eigenvectors are the same. So the eigenfunctions (which are the eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, which is 2D. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So that's correct. So D is correct? Or is it that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator?

Wait, the matrix operator is represented in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are functions in that basis. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, yes. So option D's statement is correct.

So the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so any eigenstate of Ay is also of A². But they don't commute with Az, so eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator. So both C and D could be correct, but let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So which options are correct?

Let's reevaluate each option:

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct as well because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis for the operator.

So both C and D are correct statements. But wait, the options are presented as which statement is correct, implying only one is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about option D. The question says: 'the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.' So, the matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis (probably computational basis). The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthogonal basis for the space, but not necessarily the same as the standard basis. So, the statement in D is correct, as the eigenvectors are a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis for the operator.

But wait, the standard basis is different. The standard basis is [1,0] and [0,1]. The eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So the statement D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

But wait, the question is phrased as: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So, perhaps this is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the operator is diagonal. The matrix representation in this eigenbasis would be diagonal, but the given matrix is in the standard basis.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of linear algebra. The matrix S is represented in the standard basis. The eigenvectors of S form a different basis. So the statement D says that the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. I think that the operator is represented in the standard basis, not in the eigenbasis. So the basis functions of the operator would be the standard basis vectors. So, the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis functions. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are (probably) not the same as the standard basis functions. So, the statement in D would be incorrect because the basis functions of the operator (standard basis) are [1,0] and [0,1], while the eigenfunctions are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ] (after normalization), which are different. So D's statement is incorrect.

Hmm, this is tricky. So if I have to choose between the options, I think option C is correct. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az. So C is a correct statement.

Wait, why can't the eigenfunctions be eigenfunctions of Az? Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A_z? No, wait, the commutator of angular momentum components: [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz, etc. So [Ay, Az] = iħ A something—probably not zero. So they don't commute, so the eigenfunctions can't be shared between Ay and Az. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

So the correct statements are C and possibly D, but D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator in the standard basis.

So, the correct answer must be option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the first row \([0, -i]\) and the second row \([i, 0]\). This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which is Hermitian. Since \( A_y \) is a scalar multiple of \( S \), it is also Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real.

The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary components. This eliminates options A and B, as both describe eigenvalues with imaginary parts, which is incorrect.

For option C, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes option C correct.

Option D states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2D space, they are not the same as the standard basis in which \( A_y \) is represented. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

The correct answer is option C, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
