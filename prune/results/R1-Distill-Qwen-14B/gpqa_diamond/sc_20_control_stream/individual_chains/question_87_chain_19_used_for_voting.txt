Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. FTIR peaks show a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the molecule is a six-membered aromatic ring, so probably benzene or a substituted benzene. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. So the benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons in total.

Wait, wait. Benzene has 6 carbons. So if the substituents add 2, each substituent must contribute one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent adds two carbons and the other zero? Let me think.

Wait, but the substituents can be groups like -X (like Cl, Br, which are one atom but no carbons) or other groups. But wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl, so likely a ketone or another carbonyl-containing group.

So, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen (like Cl). Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl). So the ring has two substituents: one is Cl, and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. If it's a di-substituted benzene, and the substituents are Cl and a carbonyl group (like a ketone), but a ketone would require more carbons. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Let's say, for example, one substituent is a Cl and the other is a carbonyl group attached to something else.

But wait, the total carbon count is 8. So benzene (6 C) plus substituents. Let's see: substituent 1 is Cl (no carbons), substituent 2 is a carbonyl group attached to maybe a CH3 or something. Wait, but a carbonyl group is like a ketone (C=O), which is maybe a group like -COCH3. That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). So 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) would make 8. Oh, wait, but wait: the benzene is substituted, so substituent 2 is COCH3, which is a ketone group.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. If the aromatic ring is para-substituted with Cl and COCH3, then the substituents would be opposite each other. Or maybe they are in another position, like meta or ortho.

Wait, the problem says it's di-substituted. So, two substituents on the ring.

But the FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, which suggests that the substituent is an aryl halide (like Ar-Cl). So one substituent is Cl, and the other is a group with a carbonyl.

So the structure is benzene with two substituents: Cl and another group that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, but the carbonyl group is part of the substituent. So, for example, the substituent could be a ketone group like -COCH3, which adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3), making a total of 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8 carbons.

Wait, but that would make substituents Cl and COCH3. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6), Cl (0), COCH3 (2 C). So total 8, which matches.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, but that would add more carbons. Wait, another substituent could be a nitro group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, so I think it's a ketone or similar.

So, the structure is benzene with Cl and a ketone group as substituents.

Now, the NMR would show signals for the aromatic protons, the ketone's neighboring protons, and any other protons from substituents.

Wait, but the substituents are Cl and COCH3. Let's think about the substitution pattern.

If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two doublets each, because each substituent deactivates the ring and directs incoming groups. But wait, the substituents are Cl (which is deactivating and meta-directing) and COCH3 (which is also deactivating and meta-directing). So if both are para, the ring would have certain symmetry.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would consist of two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent, and the protons opposite would be another set.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the ring as having substituents at the para positions. So, if the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the ring's protons would be in two sets of two each, as each substituent is opposite the other.

Wait, but let me think about the substitution pattern. If the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 3 (meta), or 1 and 2 (ortho), or 1 and 4 (para), how would the protons appear in NMR.

Wait, if substituents are para, then the ring would have two doublets, each with two protons. Because each substituent is in position 1 and 4, for example, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to COCH3. But wait, no, wait: in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other, so the neighboring protons would be equivalent.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to certain splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that make the aromatic protons a doublet of doublets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are para, so the ring's protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets. For example, each substituent is at positions 1 and 4, so the adjacent positions (2 and 6 for Cl, and 3 and 5 for COCH3) would each have two protons as doublets.

But wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents, each being ortho to their substituent, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets.

Wait, but let's think about the actual structure. Let's say the ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4. Then the adjacent protons would be at positions 2, 6 (next to Cl) and 3,5 (next to COCH3). Each set would be a doublet because each proton is next to one substituent. So the NMR would show two doublets: one integrating to 2H and another 2H.

Wait, but then the aromatic protons in the NMR would show two doublets, each 2H. So looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d),7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 ppm is a singlet, maybe an aromatic proton. But if the substituents are para, maybe the ring's protons are split into two doublets. So this might fit.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet, probably a CH3 attached to something like a ketone. So the substituent would be COCH3. So in that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. Which matches what I thought earlier. So option C has aromatic protons as 2H and 2H, which would make sense. Also, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for the CH3 group in COCH3.

Wait, but option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which might suggest a proton that's deshielded, perhaps an aldehyde proton, but that's not present in the structure we're thinking of. Alternatively, maybe a proton adjacent to an electronegative group like Cl. But with a para substituent, perhaps the ortho protons are deshielded, but I'm not sure if they would be a singlet.

Wait, another point: the substituent is COCH3. So in the structure, the ketone group would be at, say, position 4, and Cl at position 1. The aromatic protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded due to the electronegative Cl. The protons adjacent to COCH3 would be slightly less deshielded because the ketone group is electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as Cl. Wait, but Cl is more de-shielding than a ketone because it's more electronegative. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the chemical shifts.

In any case, looking at the options, let's see which ones fit the scenario.

Option A: It has two doublets for the aromatic protons (7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each 2H). Then a singlet at 9.9 ppm for 1H, which would be a proton perhaps attached to an electronegative group. But in our structure, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. There's no aldehyde or anything else, so this 9.9 ppm peak might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton next to Cl? But in a para substituent, the ortho protons would be equivalent and split as a doublet.

Option C: The aromatic peaks are two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), which fits with a COCH3 group. Because COCH3 would have a CH3 group as a singlet, since it's attached to the carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. So this might be the correct option.

Option D: It has 6.9 (1H, s), which doesn't fit with our structure. Also, it has peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are more indicative of perhaps an ethylene group or something with adjacent protons, maybe an OCH2 group. So this might not fit.

Option B: Peaks around 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which could be from an ether or an ester group, but I don't see how that fits with our substituents. So probably not.

So, the correct structure would have a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 as substituents. The NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons (each 2H) and a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. Looking at the options, option C matches this: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the integration. The substituent COCH3 has three carbons: the carbonyl C, the adjacent C (which is attached to the ring), and the CH3. Wait, no, the structure would be Ar-CO-CH3. So the substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. So the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. So in NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet, as it's attached to a carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. So that's 3H at around 2.3 ppm.

So, the aromatic ring protons would be two doublets, each 2H. So the NMR would have peaks at around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. The substituent's CH3 would be at 2.3 ppm.

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That fits perfectly. So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (likely Ar-Cl). This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a ketone (-COCH₃). 

The total carbon count is 8: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 0 from Cl, and 2 from the -COCH₃ group. The substituents are likely para to each other, as this arrangement is common for di-substituted aromatic compounds. In this case, the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl and the aromatic protons adjacent to -COCH₃ would each form two equivalent doublets in the NMR spectrum. The CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl would appear as a singlet at a chemical shift around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which does not fit the expected structure. The aromatic protons should form two doublets, and there is no aldehyde or other group that would produce a singlet at this chemical shift.
- **Option B**: Contains peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are indicative of protons near an oxygen atom (e.g., an ether or ester group). This does not match the expected substituents of Cl and -COCH₃.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for the aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), consistent with the -COCH₃ group. This matches the expected NMR pattern for the compound.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which does not fit the expected aromatic proton pattern. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a different type of substituent, likely involving an oxygen atom.

The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and -COCH₃ groups.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. FTIR peaks show a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the molecule is a six-membered aromatic ring, so probably benzene or a substituted benzene. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. So the benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons in total.

Wait, but the substituents can be groups like -X (like Cl, Br, which are one atom but no carbons) or other groups. But wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl, so likely a ketone or another carbonyl-containing group.

So, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen (like Cl). Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl). So the ring has two substituents: one is Cl, and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. If it's a di-substituted benzene, and the substituents are Cl and a carbonyl group (like a ketone), but a ketone would require more carbons. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Let's say, for example, one substituent is a Cl and the other is a carbonyl group attached to something else.

But wait, the total carbon count is 8. So benzene (6 C) plus substituents. Let's see: substituent 1 is Cl (no carbons), substituent 2 is a carbonyl group attached to maybe a CH3 or something. Wait, but a carbonyl group is like a ketone (C=O), which is maybe a group like -COCH3. That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). So 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) would make 8. Oh, wait, but wait: the benzene is substituted, so substituent 2 is COCH3, which is a ketone group.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. If the aromatic ring is para-substituted with Cl and COCH3, then the substituents would be opposite each other. Or maybe they are in another position, like meta or ortho.

Wait, the problem says it's di-substituted. So, two substituents on the ring.

But the FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, which suggests that the substituent is an aryl halide (like Ar-Cl). So one substituent is Cl, and the other is a group with a carbonyl.

So the structure is benzene with two substituents: Cl and another group that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, but the carbonyl group is part of the substituent. So, for example, the substituent could be a ketone group like -COCH3, which adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3), making a total of 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8 carbons.

Wait, but that would make substituents Cl and COCH3. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6), Cl (0), COCH3 (2 C). So total 8, which matches.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, but that would add more carbons. Wait, another substituent could be a nitro group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, so I think it's a ketone or similar.

So, the structure is benzene with Cl and a ketone group as substituents.

Now, the NMR would show signals for the aromatic protons, the ketone's neighboring protons, and any other protons from substituents.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would consist of two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent, and the protons opposite would be another set.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the ring as having substituents at the para positions. So, if the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the ring's protons would be in two sets of two each, as each substituent is opposite the other.

Wait, but let me think about the substitution pattern. If the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 3 (meta), or 1 and 2 (ortho), or 1 and 4 (para), how would the protons appear in NMR.

Wait, if substituents are para, then the ring would have two doublets, each with two protons. Because each substituent is in position 1 and 4, for example, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to COCH3.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d),7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 ppm is a singlet, maybe an aromatic proton. But if the substituents are para, maybe the ring's protons are split into two doublets. So this might fit.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet, probably a CH3 attached to something like a ketone. So the substituent would be COCH3. So in that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. Which matches what I thought earlier. So option C has aromatic protons as 2H and 2H, which would make sense. Also, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for the CH3 group in COCH3.

Wait, but option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which might suggest a proton that's deshielded, perhaps an aldehyde proton, but that's not present in the structure we're thinking of. Alternatively, maybe a proton adjacent to an electronegative group like Cl. But with a para substituent, perhaps the ortho protons are deshielded, but I'm not sure if they would be a singlet.

Wait, another point: the substituent is COCH3. So in the structure, the ketone group would be at, say, position 4, and Cl at position 1. The aromatic protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded due to the electronegative Cl. The protons adjacent to COCH3 would be slightly less deshielded because the ketone group is electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as Cl. Wait, but Cl is more de-shielding than a ketone because it's more electronegative. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the chemical shifts.

In any case, looking at the options, let's see which ones fit the scenario.

Option A: It has two doublets for the aromatic protons (7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each 2H). Then a singlet at 9.9 ppm for 1H, which would be a proton perhaps attached to an electronegative group. But in our structure, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. There's no aldehyde or anything else, so this 9.9 ppm peak might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton next to Cl? But in a para substituent, the ortho protons would be equivalent and split as a doublet.

Option C: The aromatic peaks are two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), which fits with a COCH3 group. Because COCH3 would have a CH3 group as a singlet, since it's attached to the carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. So this might be the correct option.

Option D: It has 6.9 (1H, s), which doesn't fit with our structure. Also, it has peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are more indicative of perhaps an ethylene group or something with adjacent protons, maybe an OCH2 group. So this might not fit.

Option B: Peaks around 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which could be from an ether or an ester group, but I don't see how that fits with our substituents. So probably not.

So, the correct structure would have a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 as substituents. The NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons (each 2H) and a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. Looking at the options, option C matches this: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the integration. The substituent COCH3 has three carbons: the carbonyl C, the adjacent C (which is attached to the ring), and the CH3. Wait, no, the structure would be Ar-CO-CH3. So the substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. So the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. So in NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet, as it's attached to a carbonyl and has no neighboring protons. So that's 3H at around 2.3 ppm.

So, the aromatic ring protons would be two doublets, each 2H. So the NMR would have peaks at around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. The substituent's CH3 would be at 2.3 ppm.

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That fits perfectly. So the correct answer is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (likely Ar-Cl). This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a ketone (-COCH₃). 

The total carbon count is 8: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 0 from Cl, and 2 from the -COCH₃ group. The substituents are likely para to each other, as this arrangement is common for di-substituted aromatic compounds. In this case, the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl and the aromatic protons adjacent to -COCH₃ would each form two equivalent doublets in the NMR spectrum. The CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl would appear as a singlet at a chemical shift around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which does not fit the expected structure. The aromatic protons should form two doublets, and there is no aldehyde or other group that would produce a singlet at this chemical shift.
- **Option B**: Contains peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are indicative of protons near an oxygen atom (e.g., an ether or ester group). This does not match the expected substituents of Cl and -COCH₃.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for the aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), consistent with the -COCH₃ group. This matches the expected NMR pattern for the compound.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which does not fit the expected aromatic proton pattern. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a different type of substituent, likely involving an oxygen atom.

The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and -COCH₃ groups.

Answer: C
