Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves two reactions of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC, both standard (achiral) and chiral columns. The options are about how many peaks each chromatogram would show.

First, I need to remember what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Wait, so for each starting alkene (E and Z), they'll form different epoxides? Let me think. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen attacks the less substituted end, so the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or wait, no, the epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the original double bond affects the epoxide's configuration. 

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on each carbon of the double bond are opposite. The epoxidation would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. That makes the epoxide trans? Or is it cis? Hmm, maybe I should think about the mechanism. Epoxidation typically occurs with a concerted mechanism where the peracid (mCPBA) attacks the double bond, and the oxygen adds across in a way that the stereochemistry of the double bond becomes the same as the epoxide's. 

Wait, no. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the peracid's oxygen adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So for an E-alkene, which is trans, the adding of the two oxygens would form an epoxide where the substituents on each epoxide carbon are on opposite sides. So the epoxide would be a trans (or maybe not, because it's a three-membered ring). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the product. (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the two methyl groups (since oct-4-ene has two CH2CH3 groups on each end?) No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH3? Wait, no. Octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, actually, let me think. The structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, octene is eight carbons. The double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's 8 carbons. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. For oct-4-ene, each carbon of the double bond (C4 and C5) is attached to two CH2 groups. Oh wait, no, each has two CH2CH2 groups on either side. Maybe I should think of it as:

Structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but the substituents on each double bond carbon are CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's think about the reaction.

When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene. For epoxidation, the oxygen adds in a syn fashion. So, for a trans-alkene (E), the epoxide will have the substituents on the same side (cis) because the addition is syn. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting double bond is E, so the substituents are opposite. When epoxidation occurs, each oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. So, the two oxygen atoms are added to the same face, making the epoxide where the substituents on each carbon are on the same side. So, the epoxide would be a trans epoxide? Or maybe it's the opposite. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps for a trans (E) double bond, the epoxidation produces a cis epoxide because the oxygen adds from the same face.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to recall that the epoxide's configuration depends on the starting alkene. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have the two substituents (like the two CH2 groups) on the same side, leading to a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the epoxide would be such that the groups that were trans in the alkene become cis in the epoxide. Because the oxygen adds across the same face, the substituents that were opposite in the double bond would end up on the same side in the epoxide—so the epoxide is trans. Wait, that's confusing.

Maybe I should think of a specific example. Take (E)-2-butene. When it reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed is cis-2,3-epoxybutane. Because the addition is syn, the substituents (like the methyl groups on either end) end up on the same side. So in that case, the epoxide has cis configuration.

Wait, 2-butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. (E) would be when the two CH3 groups are on opposite sides. But wait, in 2-butene, the substituents are CH3 on the ends. So for (E)-2-butene, the two substituents on either end of the double bond are CH3 and CH2CH3 (if it's butene)? No, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think that for any alkene, when epoxidized, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are added with the same stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the product of (E)-oct-4-ene and mCPBA is an epoxide where the two substituents (like the groups on C4 and C5) are on the same side. So the epoxide would be a cis epoxide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a trans epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the general rule: when an E-alkene reacts with mCPBA, what epoxide is formed? Oh wait, I can't look things up now, so I'll proceed based on logic.

Assuming that (E)-oct-4-ene forms a cis epoxide, because the addition of the oxygen is syn. So, the substituents that were on opposite sides (trans) in the alkene become on the same side in the epoxide, making it a cis (or maybe trans) epoxide.

Wait, no. Let's model it: imagine the double bond as CH2-CH2, with the substituents (like CH2CH3) on each end. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like the two CH2CH2 groups) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen comes from the same face, so the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide would be on the same face, making the epoxide a cis configuration. So, for (E)-alkene, we get a cis epoxide.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Let me think differently. Take (E)-but-2-ene: it's CH2-CH2 (with the substituents on opposite ends). When epoxidized, the oxygen atoms add across the same face, so the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide that were on the same face in the alkene would end up adjacent in the epoxide. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trans epoxide. Because in the alkene, the groups are opposite (E), and upon epoxidation, the oxygens add from the same face, causing the substituents to be on the same side in the epoxide, leading to a cis epoxide.

Wait, but for each reaction, when you treat with aqueous acid after epoxidation, what happens? Oh right, acid catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. The epoxide is treated with acid, which protonates the oxygen, making the ring more electrophilic. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon in a conjugate addition.

Wait, no. In acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening, the mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring then opens as a carbocation is formed. The nucleophile (like water) attacks the carbocation.

Wait, but for epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because that's where the carbocation is more stable.

So, let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → forms an epoxide. Let's say that's a cis epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide opens. The more substituted carbon is the same on both sides because oct-4-ene is symmetric. Wait, wait. Oct-4-ene is symmetric—that is, both ends of the double bond are the same. So, the resulting epoxide is symmetric as well.

Wait, no. Let me get the structure right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, octene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3—no, that's not right. Maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's 8 carbons. Wait, let's count: oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait: for octene, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's more than 8. Let me write the structure properly.

Actually, oct-4-ene is: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, octane is eight carbons. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Let me think: actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3—no, wait, that would be 8 carbons, but with double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps a better way: the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, maybe the correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that can't be right because that's 7 carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just imagine that the epoxide is symmetric. So, when treated with acid, the epoxide ring opens and forms a diol. But because the starting epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening would lead to a single product.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring opening would produce a single diol. But wait, under acidic conditions, the diol would form in a specific configuration.

Wait, but perhaps the epoxide is asymmetric, but for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxides are different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide A. Then, epoxide A treated with aqueous acid → product A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide B. Then, epoxide B treated with aqueous acid → product B.

The question is, what are products A and B?

Assuming that (E)-oct-4-ene gives a different epoxide than (Z)-oct-4-ene, which then, upon acid treatment, gives different diols.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A. Let's say that the epoxide is trans. Then, in acid, the ring opens to form a diol. But how will the diol look?

Wait, for a symmetric epoxide, like one derived from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric because both ends of the double bond are the same. So, the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So, when it opens under acid, it would form a diol. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have the same groups on each end, leading to a single product.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B. Since the starting alkene is Z (cis), the epoxide would have the substituents on the same face. So, the epoxide might be a trans configuration. But again, since the starting alkene is symmetric, the epoxide would also be symmetric, leading to a single diol upon acid treatment.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a single compound. So, Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each produce a single diol. But would those diols be the same or different?

Wait, no, because the starting alkenes are E and Z. Their epoxides are different. So, when they undergo acid treatment, the diols would be different.

Wait, but wait. If the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), and the epoxides are different, then the diols after acid treatment would be different.

Wait, let me think of how the diol forms. The epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions leads to a carbocation, and the nucleophile attacks. For a symmetric epoxide, the attack would happen equally on both carbons, leading to the same product regardless of which side the attack happens. So, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol is a single product. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, then the attack could lead to different products, but if the epoxide is symmetric, it'll lead to a single product.

Wait, but in Reaction 1 and 2, the starting alkenes are different (E and Z), so their epoxides are different. So, each reaction would produce a different epoxide, which, when treated with acid, would produce different diols.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose (E)-oct-4-ene forms an epoxide that is symmetric. Then, when treated with acid, it would form a diol that's a single product. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide that's symmetric (but different from the E product), leading to a diol that's a different single product. So, the products of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are two different diols.

Then, the chemist combines these two diols and runs them on HPLC.

Now, the HPLC columns: the standard (achiral) column and a chiral column.

In achiral columns, enantiomers would co-elute because the column can't distinguish them. But if the diols are enantiomers, they would be a single peak on achiral column. But wait, in this case, are the diols enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, if Reaction 1 produces a certain diol and Reaction 2 produces another diol, and these diols are enantiomers, then on a standard HPLC, they would appear as one peak, but on a chiral column, they would show as two peaks (each enantiomer elutes at a different time). But wait, in our case, are these diols enantiomers or not?

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, because the epoxide is symmetric, so the diol would be a single enantiomer, or maybe a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. Let's think about the epoxide. For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A. Epoxide A, being symmetric, would have two equivalent faces. When treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol must be a single compound. But wait, could it form two enantiomers? No, because in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the ring opening under acid would lead to a diol that is itself symmetric—so no chiral centers.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about the structure. Suppose the epoxide is symmetric, like a trans epoxide. Upon acid treatment, the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. If the carbons are each attached to two identical groups (because the epoxide is symmetric), then the diol would be achiral.

Wait, let's say the epoxide is derived from (E)-oct-4-ene. The epoxide would have two CH2CH2 groups on each end, making it symmetric. Upon acid treatment, the diol would be HO-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-OH, but that doesn't make sense. No, actually, the diol would be HO-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, no. Let me think: the epoxide is between C4 and C5. After opening, each of these carbons would have an OH group.

Wait, perhaps the diol is HO-CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, considering oct-4-ene, the epoxide is between C4 and C5. So after opening, the diol would be HO-CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. But wait, that's an eight-carbon chain with two OH groups on C4 and C5.

But if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have the same groups on each side, so the diol would be a single compound. But would that diol be chiral?

Wait, suppose the diol has OH groups on C4 and C5. If both OHs are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans), but the molecule is symmetric. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)CH(OH)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, because after epoxide opening, the OHs would be on adjacent carbons. So, it's actually HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a diol with the two OHs on C4 and C5, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the molecule is symmetric around the middle. So, the diol would have the same groups on either side, making it achiral.

Wait, but in that case, the diol would not have any chiral centers. Because the molecule is symmetric, any chiral centers would have a mirror image counterpart, leading to an achiral molecule.

Wait, but if the diol has two chiral centers, each with a mirror image, then it would be meso.

Ah, right! So, if the diol has two chiral centers, but the molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So, in this case, the diol would be meso, meaning it has two chiral centers but is not chiral because of internal symmetry.

So for Reaction 1 and 2, each produces a meso diol. Because the starting epoxides are symmetric, leading to diols that are meso compounds.

Wait, but in that case, the diols from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would be the same? Or different?

Wait, no. Because if (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene form different epoxides, then their diols would be different meso compounds.

Let me think. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans, leading to diol A, which is a meso compound. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis, leading to diol B, which is a different meso compound.

So, when the chemist combines the products from both reactions, they have two different meso compounds.

Wait, but wait. If the epoxide from (E) and (Z) are different, their diols would be different. For example, (E) may lead to a trans-diol, and (Z) to a cis-diol, but in both cases, the diol is symmetric, hence a meso compound.

Wait, but actually, the opening of the epoxide under acidic conditions leads to a specific stereochemistry in the diol.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual mechanism. The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens with the nucleophile (water) attacking the more substituted carbon. But in the case of a symmetric epoxide, both carbons are equally substituted, so the attack can happen on either side, leading to both possible diastereomers, but since the molecule is symmetric, they would form a meso compound.

Wait, no, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the attack can happen from either face, but due to the symmetry, the resulting diol would be the same, i.e., a meso compound.

So, in Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A (trans?), which upon acid treatment → meso diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B (cis?), which upon acid treatment → meso diol B.

But wait, in both cases, the diol would have the same structure. Because the epoxide is symmetric, leading to the same diol regardless of the starting E or Z configuration. Or am I getting this wrong?

Hmm, perhaps I should think of a specific example. Let's take (E)-2-butene and (Z)-2-butene.

Epoxidizing (E)-2-butene gives a trans epoxide, which upon acid treatment forms a diol. Wait, no. (E)-2-butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, 2-butene is CH3CH=CHCH3. Wait, no—2-butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's 1-butene. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, 1-butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and 2-butene is CH2CH2-CH2CH3. No, no, 2-butene is CH3CH=CHCH3. So, for (E)-2-butene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are CH3 and CH3, but on opposite sides. When epoxidized, the epoxide is cis because the addition is syn. So, the epoxide would have the two CH3 groups on the same side.

Then, when treated with acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be meso. So, the diol would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons, each with CH3 groups on either side, and the molecule would be achiral because of symmetry.

Similarly, (Z)-2-butene would form the same epoxide because the starting alkene is such that the substituents are on the same face, leading to the same epoxide. Or wait, no. (Z) and (E) 2-butene, when epoxidized, would form the same epoxide because both are symmetric. So, in that case, the diol would be the same.

Wait, but in the problem, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene. Since oct-4-ene is symmetric, both (E) and (Z) would form the same epoxide, leading to the same diol. But that can't be right because (E) and (Z) are different.

Wait, no. (E) and (Z) alkenes with symmetric structures would form the same epoxide. Because for a symmetric alkene, the E and Z isomers are the same.

Wait, that's a key point! For a symmetric double bond, like in oct-4-ene, the (E) and (Z) isomers are actually the same compound. Because the molecule is symmetric, flipping the molecule would make the E and Z configurations identical.

Wait, no. Wait, for a double bond with identical substituents on each end, the (E) and (Z) designations don't make sense because the molecule is symmetric. So, perhaps oct-4-ene is actually a single compound because it's symmetric. So, (E) and (Z) would be the same.

Wait, no. Wait, (E) and (Z) refer to the configuration of substituents around the double bond. For a symmetric alkene like oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end are the same, so the E and Z isomers are the same. So, in reality, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are the same compound.

Wait, that can't be right because the question says the chemist uses both (E) and (Z). So, perhaps I'm wrong and the starting alkenes are not symmetric.

Wait, maybe oct-4-ene is not symmetric. Let me think again. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, that's not right. Let me write the structure properly.

Actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 where the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond has a CH2CH2 group on one side and a CH2CH2 group on the other. So, both ends are the same. Therefore, the molecule is symmetric, making (E) and (Z) isomers impossible. Because for a molecule to have E and Z isomerism, the substituents on each end of the double bond must be different.

Ah, so that's the key! So, if the double bond is between two identical groups, the molecule can't have E and Z isomerism. Therefore, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are the same compound, which doesn't make sense because the question presents them as separate.

Wait, but that can't be right. So, maybe I made a mistake in considering the structure of oct-4-ene.

Wait, perhaps oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that would be 7 carbons. No, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure correctly.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's 8 carbons. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's 8 carbons. No, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that can't be right because that's more than 8 carbons. No, wait, maybe it's:

Carbons 1 to 8: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

Structure: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5.

Wait, so each end of the double bond is CH2-CH2-CH2- and CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond is CH2-CH2-CH2-... and ...-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's 8 carbons, so the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond are -CH2CH2CH2CH3 and -CH2CH2CH3. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps on each end of the double bond, there are two CH2 groups on one side and two CH2 groups on the other. So, each end is CH2-CH2-CH2- and CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should count the substituents. For oct-4-ene, the groups on each end of the double bond are -(CH2)2CH2CH3 and -(CH2)2CH3. Wait, no, that would be:

Carbon 4: connected to two CH2 groups (on either side) and a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps each end has a propyl group and an ethyl group. Maybe it's better to think that the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, making the molecule symmetric.

If that's the case, then the alkene is symmetric, and (E) and (Z) forms are the same. Therefore, the initial premise of the question is flawed. But the question presents them as separate, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end are different. For example, one end has a CH2CH2CH3 and the other has a CH2CH2CH2 group, making them different. So, the double bond is between two different substituents, allowing E and Z isomerism.

In that case, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are different compounds, each with their own stereochemistry.

Assuming that, when each reacts with mCPBA, they form different epoxides. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide forms a diol.

Now, the products are two different diols. Let's think about their structures.

Epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene: trans configuration.

Epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene: cis configuration.

When treated with acid, each epoxide opens to form a diol. For each case:

1. (E) → trans epoxide → upon acid treatment, forms diol A.

2. (Z) → cis epoxide → upon acid treatment, forms diol B.

Now, are these diols chiral?

Assuming that the epoxides are asymmetric, then the diols would have chiral centers. But if the epoxides are symmetric, the diols would be meso.

Wait, but if the starting alkene is asymmetric (so E and Z are different), then the epoxides would be asymmetric as well, leading to diols with chiral centers.

Wait, but if the epoxides are asymmetric, then the diol could have two chiral centers, leading to possible stereoisomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but since the reaction goes to completion, each diol would be a racemic mixture.

Wait, but the reaction under acidic conditions would form the diol with a specific stereochemistry. Let me think again about the mechanism.

When the epoxide is symmetric, the attack by the nucleophile (water) can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, the attack would favor a specific face, leading to a single diastereomer.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to get back to the problem.

The chemist combines the products of both reactions. So, the products are diol A and diol B. Each diol may have some stereochemistry.

When run on a standard (achiral) HPLC, enantiomers would co-elute. On a chiral HPLC, enantiomers would separate.

So, if diol A is a single enantiomer, or a racemic mixture, that would affect the HPLC results.

Wait, but the problem states that both reactions go to 100% completion. So, for each reaction, diol A and diol B are formed in 100% yield. But are they racemic, or a single enantiomer?

In acidic epoxide ring opening, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. If the epoxide is asymmetric, the attack would lead to formation of a specific diastereomer, but perhaps not necessarily a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps for each epoxide, the ring opening leads to a single diastereomer. So, diol A and diol B are each single diastereomers.

But I'm getting stuck on whether the diols are chiral or not.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol has two chiral centers, and they are enantiomers of each other.

Wait, let's think: diol A from Reaction 1 has two chiral centers, say R and R configuration. Diol B from Reaction 2 has two chiral centers, S and S. Are these enantiomers?

No, because if the diols are mirror images, they would be enantiomers. But if the diols are different in structure, they might not be enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a diol that's a pair of enantiomers (racemic), and Reaction 2 produces another diol that's also a pair of enantiomers. But if the two diols are not enantiomers, then on a chiral HPLC, each would show their own set of peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer, but that would require some kind of stereoselective reaction, which under acidic conditions, I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Under acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opening is typically not stereoselective in a way that forms a single enantiomer. It tends to form a racemic mixture if the product is a pair of enantiomers.

But wait, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the attack occurs equally from both sides, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, perhaps the attack is not symmetric, leading to a specific diastereomer.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should approach it from the HPLC perspective.

The chemist combines the products from both reactions, which are two different diols. Each diol may be a single compound (meso) or a racemic mixture.

If each diol is a single meso compound, then on a standard HPLC, they would both elute as single peaks, giving a total of two peaks. On a chiral HPLC, since meso compounds are achiral, they would also elute as single peaks. So, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well.

But, if each reaction produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers, then on the standard HPLC, each would elute as one peak (since enantiomers can't be distinguished). On a chiral HPLC, each racemic mixture would split into two peaks (for each enantiomer). So, if both reactions produce racemic diols, the chiral HPLC would show four peaks (two for each diol's enantiomers).

But the question states that the chemist combines the products of both reactions, so the mixture has two diols, each possibly with their own stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a meso diol, and Reaction 2 produces another meso diol, which is different. So, on standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, totaling two. On chiral HPLC, both would be single peaks because they're achiral.

But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer, and combining them gives a racemic mixture of each diol. Then, on standard HPLC, each diol would be a single peak (since enantiomers co-elute), giving two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diol would split into two peaks, giving four peaks. But that's option D.

Wait, but let me re-examine the reaction conditions. Both reactions are done with one equivalent of mCPBA, so the epoxidation is complete. Then, aqueous acid is added, leading to complete ring opening.

Assuming that each epoxide is asymmetric, the diol would have two chiral centers, and each diol would be a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture) if the reaction is not stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a pair of enantiomers, and the diol from Reaction 2 is a different pair of enantiomers. So, when combined, you have four enantiomers: two from each diol.

Wait, but that's four compounds in total. So, on standard HPLC, each pair would co-elute, giving two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each pair would split into two, giving four peaks.

But the options don't have four peaks in standard and four in chiral. The options are A) 4 peaks in both, B) 2 and 3, C) 2 and 2, D) 3 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer, so combining them gives two different enantiomers, leading to two peaks in standard HPLC and two in chiral HPLC. But that doesn't align with any options.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a single diastereomer, which would be a single peak on standard HPLC and a single peak on chiral HPLC.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a diol with two chiral centers, but these diols are not enantiomers of each other. So, each diol is a diastereomer of the other, leading to two peaks in standard HPLC and possibly more in chiral.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of the problem differently.

The products after both reactions are two different diols. Each diol may have two chiral centers.

If these diols are not enantiomers, then on a standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, giving two peaks in total. On a chiral HPLC, each diol could split into two peaks (if they are racemic) or remain as one peak (if they are meso).

Wait, but if each diol is a racemic mixture, then each would have two enantiomers. So, on standard HPLC, each would be a single peak. On chiral, each would split into two, leading to four peaks in total.

But the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, but it doesn't specify whether the products are racemic or single enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps under the reaction conditions, the diol is formed as a single enantiomer. For example, if the epoxide is asymmetric, the ring opening under acidic conditions leads to a specific diastereomer, not a racemic mixture.

In that case, each reaction produces a single enantiomer of a diol. So, combining both reactions would give two enantiomers (each from their respective reactions). So, on standard HPLC, each diol would be a single peak, giving two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each would split into two peaks (enantiomers), giving four peaks. But that's option D: 3 and 4, which doesn't fit.

Wait, no. If each reaction produces a single enantiomer, then the mixture has two different enantiomers, each from a different diol. So, when run on standard HPLC, they would elute as two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each would split into two, giving four peaks. But that's not an option. The options are A)4, B)2 and 3, C)2 and 2, D)3 and4.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer of the same diol. No, that can't be because the diols are different.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of what the possible answers could be.

Option C says 2 peaks in standard and 2 in chiral.

If both products are meso compounds, then on standard HPLC, each is a single peak (total two). On chiral HPLC, each would be a single peak, so again two peaks.

Alternatively, if each reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (so each is a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers), then on standard HPLC, each diol would be a single peak. So, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diol would split into two, leading to four peaks.

But the options don't have four peaks for standard and four for chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but the two diols are not enantiomers of each other. So, on standard HPLC, each diol is a single peak (two peaks). On chiral HPLC, each diol splits into two, leading to four peaks.

But the options don't have four in both. So, perhaps the correct answer is C) 2 and 2.

Wait, but if the diols are meso, then they are achiral, leading to two peaks in standard and two in chiral.

Yes, that makes sense. Because each diol is a single meso compound, thus achiral. So, when run on standard HPLC, each is a single peak, giving two peaks in total. On chiral HPLC, each meso compound would still be a single peak, as they are achiral. So, the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

So, the correct answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the analysis of the products using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reactions and Products**:  
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans epoxide, while (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis epoxide.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxides undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon of the epoxide, leading to the formation of diols.  

2. **Nature of the Diols**:  
   - The diols formed from both (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are meso compounds.  
   - A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. This means that each diol is achiral, even though it contains chiral centers.  

3. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
     - Since the diols are achiral, they cannot be separated into enantiomers. Each diol will elute as a single peak.  
     - Combining the products of both reactions results in two distinct diols, leading to **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC.  

   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - A chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers. However, since the diols are meso compounds and achiral, they will not interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.  
     - Each diol will elute as a single peak on the chiral HPLC as well, resulting in **2 peaks**.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - On both the standard and chiral HPLC columns, the chemist will observe **2 peaks** corresponding to the two distinct meso diols formed in the reactions.
