Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. So, they have three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants and some double mutants. The results are about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild type.

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, we're looking for gene interactions, maybe something like epistasis or redundancy.

The data given is the resistance percentages. Wild type is 100%, which is the control. The mutants have varying resistances:
- g1: 75% → which is 75% of control, so less resistance.
- g2: 0% → no resistance, so more susceptible.
- g3: 50% → half as resistant.
- g1g3: 10% → very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

So, the question is about drawing conclusions from these results. The options are about which gene is the transcription factor and how the others interact.

Hmm. Let's think about what each result implies.

First, when a single gene is knocked out, like g2, the resistance is zero. That suggests that G2 is critical because without it, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So G2 might be a master regulator, perhaps a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

Looking at the other single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance. So both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but G2 is more essential.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the g2 single mutant. So whatever G1 contributes is downstream of G2. If G2 is upstream, then without G2, the absence of G1 doesn't make it any worse—because G2 is already not working. So epistasis here would mean G2 is upstream (epistatic) to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%—same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait, wait. But what about the other double mutant, g1g3, which is 10%. So knocking out both G1 and G3 gives a much lower resistance than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 may contribute independently. If they were redundant, maybe knocking out both would not make it worse than the worse single mutant. But in this case, 10% is worse than either 50% (g3) or 75% (g1). So perhaps they function in separate pathways, and both are needed. Alternatively, they might be additive.

Wait, but what's the role of a transcription factor? If G2 is the transcription factor, then it would regulate the expression of other genes, like G1 and G3. So both G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2.

So if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking out G2 would mean that G1 and G3 aren't expressed either? Or maybe their expression depends on G2.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. So G1 is not the transcription factor because when G1 is knocked out, the plant is still somewhat resistant. Whereas when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. So G2 is the transcription factor (since knocking it out completely eliminates resistance). So that would make G2 the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are probably downstream targets.

But wait, when you have G2 knocked out, you can't make any resistance. So G1 and G3 would not be functional because they're downstream and require G2's regulation.

But wait, the data says that g1 has 75% resistance. So in the absence of G1, the plant is still 75% resistant. That suggests that G1 is not the only gene contributing to resistance. Maybe G2 is the main one, and G3 and G1 are secondary. Or perhaps G1 is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to no resistance. But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are still expressed, but their absence reduces resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, which is 75% of the wild type. So when G1 is knocked out, the plant is 75% as resistant as the wild type. Without G1, they're less resistant, but not completely susceptible. Similarly, without G3, they're 50% resistant.

But without G2, they're 0%—so G2 is necessary for any resistance. So that suggests that G2 is the transcription factor that turns on G1 and G3. Because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to no resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, G3 can still function a bit (since 75% resistance is higher than 50%). Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway.

Wait, but the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So G2 being knocked out is epistatic to G1, meaning G2 is upstream. Similarly, g2g3 is 0% → same as g2, so G2 is upstream of G3.

So the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

Now, how do G1 and G3 interact? Let's look at their double mutant: g1g3 has 10% resistance. The single mutants are 75% and 50%. So the double mutant is more susceptible than either single. So if they were in parallel pathways (each contributing some resistance), knocking out both would reduce resistance further. If they were additive, then 75% + 50% = 125% → but that's not how percentages work. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps they function redundantly. If they are redundant, each provides some level of resistance. But if both are knocked out, the resistance might drop more.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would result in a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. But in our case, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant, because without both, the situation is worse than either alone.

Alternatively, perhaps they work in the same pathway. If G1 is not expressed, the pathway is less active. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and both contribute to the same process. So when both are knocked out, the pathway is completely inactive. But then, why isn't g1g3 zero? It's 10%, so maybe there's another gene that provides a small amount of resistance.

Alternatively, maybe it's epistatic. Let me think about epistasis. If two genes are in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single if they are in series. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than either single, which suggests they are in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So when you knock out both, there's no resistance at all. But why is the double mutant at 10% then? That's a small amount, perhaps due to some other factor.

Wait, but in the presence of G2, the resistance is normal. So G2 is the master TF that activates the other two. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are active. If G2 is not present, then no resistance.

But when you have a g1 mutant (G2 is present), then G3 is active. So the resistance is 75%, which is higher than the g3 mutant (50%). So perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, but without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is expressed, but the resistance is 75% of wild type. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance, and G3 contributes 50% (because when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50% of wild type). So in the wild type, with G2 active, both G1 and G3 are active. So their individual contributions add or multiply.

Wait, perhaps it's multiplicative. If the wild type is 100%, then G1 contributes 75% (so without G1, you lose 25% of resistance), and G3 contributes 50% (so without G3, you lose 50%). But in the wild type, both are active. If they are independent, then maybe the total resistance is something like 75% (G1) multiplied by 50% (G3), but that would be 37.5%, which doesn't fit the data. Hmm, maybe additive? 75% (G1) plus 50% (G3) would be 125%, but the wild type is 100%, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of G1 and G3 each add to the overall resistance. So without G1, you have 50% (G3's contribution) → but wait, in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than G3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps without G1, G3's contribution is 75% of the wild type. Without G3, G1's contribution is 50% of the wild type. So G1 contributes more. So when both are knocked out, you can't get any from either, so that would be 0%? But the g1g3 mutant is 10%, which is not zero. So perhaps there's another gene involved, but that's beyond the question's scope.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Options:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, G2 is a transcription factor? But from the data, g2 is 0%, so G2 is more likely to be the TF. Because the other single mutants don't have 0% resistance. So option A says G1 is TF, which I'm not sure about.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter—so maybe they are co-regulated. Not sure if that's indicated.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. Maybe not directly relevant here.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if you knock out both, the phenotype is worse than either single. Which fits with the g1g3 mutant being 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%). So G1 and G3 are redundant in some way, such that their combined knockout is worse than either alone.

Wait, but what about the epistasis part. Option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. But from the data, in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's phenotype masks G1's. So G2 is epistatic to G1, which would mean G2 is upstream.

Similarly, for G3, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So G2 is the TF, upstream of both G1 and G3. So their phenotypes are masked by the presence of G2 knockout.

Now, looking at the double mutants without G2, like g1g3, which has 10% resistance. So without G2, G1 and G3 cannot be expressed, but perhaps some other factor gives 10% resistance. So G1 and G3 are downstream.

But how do G1 and G3 relate to each other? The double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse, suggesting that they function in parallel pathways, so each contributes some resistance, and without both, the resistance drops more. Alternatively, if they were redundant, then knocking out both would not make the resistance worse than the more severe single knockout. But here, 10% is worse than both 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). So this suggests that they are not redundant, but perhaps work in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function at different steps. So their combined knockout might have a more severe effect.

Wait, but the question is about which option is correct.

Looking at the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, pleiotropy would mean that G1 affects multiple traits, but perhaps not directly relevant here. Maybe instead, they have overlapping functions. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the wild-type, both are functional. If you lose one, the other can compensate, but knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype. Which is what we see in g1g3 (10% < 50% and 75%). So that fits.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have similar phenotypes. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which are different. So that doesn't fit with redundancy because redundant genes would have similar phenotypes when single mutants are made. So that might not hold.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps they are not fully redundant but have additive effects. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: epistasis. The term 'epistatic towards' refers to one gene masking the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a functional G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in this case, when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single. So perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's function is downstream of G3.

Wait, no. If G3 is epistatic to G1, that means that G3 is downstream. Because the phenotype of G3 would determine the outcome, regardless of G1. But in our case, the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either single. So that might not fit.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse. So the two genes contribute to resistance in a way that their combined absence makes the plant more susceptible than either alone. This suggests that they are in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, their combined knockout might not have a more severe effect.

Wait, but no, if they're in the same pathway and both contribute, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe effect. For example, if G1 and G3 are both part of a defense pathway, and each contributes a certain amount, then knocking both would lead to a more severe phenotype. So that makes sense.

But how does epistasis come into play?

Wait, the epistatic gene is the one that's upstream. Because the downstream gene's effect is masked. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1 is upstream. So the phenotype of G3 is masked when G1 is knocked out.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So both are knocked out. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to epistasis.

Let me think about the possible options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their single mutants would have similar phenotypes. But in our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. That doesn't fit redundancy. So maybe D is incorrect.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that's relevant here. But perhaps G1 and G3 affect more than one process.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both under the control of G2.

So, in the case of G2 being the TF, G2 activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance. So without G2, both pathways are inactive, leading to no resistance (g2 is 0%).

In the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, so the resistance is 50% of wild type. Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75%. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let's see:

- Wild type: all genes active. Resistance is 100%.

- g1: G1 is knocked out. So only G2 and G3 are active.

But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, resistance is 75% of wild type. So G2 and G3 must be providing 75% of the resistance. So G1 contributes 25% (since 75% is left).

- g3: G3 is knocked out. So G1 and G2 are active. Resistance is 50%, so G1 and G2 are providing 50% of resistance. So G3 contributes 50% of the resistance when active.

Wait, but that can't be. Because in the wild type, all are active. So (G1 + G2 + G3) must equal 100% resistance.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with equations.

Let me denote the contributions:

Let’s say the wild type has 100% resistance, which is the sum of G1, G2, and G3 contributions.

But in reality, the resistance is likely a product of these genes. It's probably more accurate to model it as each gene providing a multiplier.

Wait, but maybe additive would be easier. Let's see.

Assume that each gene contributes additively to the resistance. So:

Wild type: G1 + G2 + G3 = 100% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75% → so G2 + G3 = 75%.

When G3 is knocked out (g3), resistance is 50% → G1 + G2 = 50%.

So, from these two equations:

G2 + G3 = 75 → equation 1

G1 + G2 = 50 → equation 2

So, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(G2 + G3) - (G1 + G2) ) = 75 -50 → G3 - G1 = 25 → G3 = G1 +25.

Now, in the wild type, G1 + G2 + G3 = 100.

From equation 2, G1 + G2 = 50. So G3 = 50. Plugging into equation 1: G2 +50=75 → G2=25.

So G2=25%, G3=50%, G1=25% (since G3=G1+25 → 25+25=50).

Wait, that can't be right because if G2 is 25%, then in the wild type, G1 + G2 (25 +25=50) would be G1 + G2 =50, which matches equation 2. And G2 + G3=25+50=75, which matches equation 1.

So in the wild type, G2 contributes 25%, G1 and G3 contribute 25 and 50 respectively. So total 100%.

But wait, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0% → which would make sense because G2 is 25%, and without it, the other genes (G1 and G3) can't contribute because G2 is the transcription factor. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, hence no resistance.

Ah, that makes sense. So G2 is the TF that activates G1 and G3. So in the knockout mutants, G1 and G3 are not expressed, so their contributions are zero, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. So that means that G1 and G3 are only expressed when G2 is present. Because without G2, they can't be expressed, so their contributions are zero.

So, in the single mutants (g1 and g3), G2 is still active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But in the double mutants (g1g3), G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are expressed, but without either.

Wait, no. Wait, in the double mutants:

g1g2: G1 and G2 are knocked out. So G3 is not expressed because G2 is necessary for its expression. So G3 can't be active. Thus, resistance is 0% (same as g2).

Similarly, g3g2: same as g2.

What about g1g3? Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So G2 is expressed, and can activate G1 and G3. But G1 and G3 are knocked out, so they can't be expressed. So without G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%. Hmm. Where does this 10% come from? Maybe from another gene that is not dependent on G2. Or perhaps the 10% is due to some basal resistance without G1 and G3. But that's beyond the current data.

Wait, but according to our earlier model, the contribution of G1 and G3 are additive. So in the wild type, G2 is 25%, G1 is 25%, G3 is 50%. So total 100%.

In the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out. So G2 is 25%, G3 is 50% → 75% → which matches the data.

In the g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out. So G2 is 25%, G1 is 25% → 50% → which matches the data.

In g1g3, both are knocked out. So only G2's 25% remains. But wait, the data says 10%. Which is less than 25%. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Maybe the model isn't additive but multiplicative. Let's try that.

Assume that each gene contributes a multiplicative factor to resistance.

So wild type: G1 * G2 * G3 = 100%.

g1: G2 * G3 = 75%.

g3: G1 * G2 = 50%.

g1g3: G2 =10%.

So let's model this.

From g1: G2 * G3 =75 → equation 1.

From g3: G1 * G2 =50 → equation 2.

From g1g3: G2 =10 → equation 3.

Wait, wait. Wait, in g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so only G2 remains. So the resistance is equal to G2's contribution. But according to the data, it's 10%, which would imply that G2 contributes 10%. But in the wild type, with all three genes, the resistance is 100%. So perhaps the multiplicative model isn't correct either.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the epistasis.

We know that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because the double mutants g1g2 and g3g2 are as severe as g2. So G2 is upstream. So G2 is the transcription factor.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Without both, resistance drops more.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the phenotypes of g1 and g3 are different, so redundancy might not fit.

Option A: G1 is TF, which doesn't fit because g2 has 0% resistance, so G2 is more likely the TF.

So the correct option should have G2 as the TF.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter suggests they are co-regulated. If both are regulated by G2, which is the TF, that makes sense. But why would G3 be epistatic to G1? That would mean G3's position is downstream. But without G3, the resistance is worse.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, for G3, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

So G2 is epistatic to both, meaning G2 is upstream.

Now, about the relationship between G1 and G3.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So in the presence of G2, but without G1 and G3.

So in the wild type, with G2 active, both G1 and G3 are active, contributing to resistance. So G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps. Or in different pathways.

Wait, but in the double mutant, they have 10% resistance, which is much less than either single. So perhaps each contributes about 25% and 50%, and without both, only 10% is left. Maybe due to another gene, but perhaps it's a small contribution.

Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me go back to the options.

Option D says G1 and G3 have gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in our data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. So redundancy doesn't fit. So D is likely incorrect.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure. Pleiotropy isn't about redundancy or epistasis, but about a gene affecting multiple traits. Not directly relevant here.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So they are co-regulated by G2. So when G2 is active, both are expressed. When G2 is inactive, neither is expressed. But the data shows that in single mutants (g1 and g3), the other gene is expressed (since g1 has 75% which is higher than g3's 50%). So G3's contribution is more than G1's. So perhaps G3 has a stronger effect when G2 is active.

But I'm still not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not in the same promoter. So they're regulated independently but both by G2.

In any case, the key points are: G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Now, the question is about their relationship.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3 (10%) again. Since each single mutant (g1:75%, g3:50%) is better than g1g3, their combined absence has a worse effect. So G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a way that their combined loss has a more severe effect. So perhaps they function in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance.

So, their functions are additive. So, without G1, you lose some resistance (75%), without G3, you lose more (50%). But without both, you lose almost all (10%).

But how does this relate to epistasis?

Epistasis is about the relationship between two genes where the phenotype of one masks the effect of the other. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps either G1 or G3 is epistatic to the other. But without knowing more, it's hard to say.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should have G2 as the TF, and G1 and G3 being downstream. It should also describe the relationship between G1 and G3.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But the data doesn't fit redundancy.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which I'm not sure about.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulation), and G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3 is downstream. But why would G3 being knocked out not affect the epistatic relationship?

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G3 is downstream. So in a double mutant, the effect of G1 is masked by G3's knockout.

Wait, but in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single. So if G3 is downstream of G1, knocking out both would have a worse effect than either. That seems to fit.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure about pleiotropy. Maybe I should think about what each option states.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the epistatic gene (G1) would determine the phenotype. But in the double mutant, the phenotype is worse than either single, which doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic. Because if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant should look like the more severe single mutant.

Wait, no. Because if G1 is epistatic to G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's presence or absence doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as g1 (if G1 is epistatic). But in our data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be determined by G3. So if G3 is knocked out, the resistance would be the same as g3 (50%). But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the epistatic relationships.

When you have two genes in the same pathway, their double mutant may not be worse than the more severe single mutant. For example, if you have a linear pathway, knocking both out may not change the phenotype beyond the most severe single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is worse, which suggests they are in separate pathways.

So, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both regulated by G2.

Now, considering epistasis: since G2 is upstream of both, it's epistatic to both. Between G1 and G3, perhaps neither is epistatic to the other, but they function in parallel.

But the options require a conclusion about their relationship.

The question is asking which conclusion can we draw regarding the genes' interactions.

Looking at the options again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which doesn't fit because their single mutants have different resistances.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which I'm not sure about.

Option A is wrong because it says G1 is the TF.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. So if G3 is epistatic, that would mean that the presence of G3 determines the phenotype. So in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So if G3 is epistatic, the g1g3 double mutant should be the same as g3 (50%). But according to data, it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding epistasis. Epistasis only refers to the position in the pathway. For example, if G3 is downstream of G1, then G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as the more severe single mutant.

But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either single, which would not fit if one is epistatic. So perhaps the correct answer is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but function in parallel.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them say that. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, let me think again. The question asks which conclusion can be drawn.

Given that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are downstream, but their double mutant is worse than either, perhaps they are in separate pathways.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That doesn't fit because their single mutants have different effects.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But earlier analysis suggests redundancy doesn't fit the single mutant data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think again.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then when either is knocked out, the other can compensate. But when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further. That's what the data shows: g1g3 is 10% < 50% and 75%. So that fits redundancy. So option D might be correct.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the single mutants should have similar phenotypes. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. That's different.

So that contradicts redundancy. So option D is probably incorrect.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to sum up.

The data indicates:

- G2 is the TF, as its knockout leads to 0% resistance, while others don't.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

- The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, suggesting they contribute additively or are in separate pathways.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

The options that have G2 as TF are B, C, D.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. I don't think that's supported, because the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't know enough about pleiotropy to make a call.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant. The data doesn't fit that.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but what's pleiotropy? It means a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I ruled that out because G2 is the TF.

Wait, let me re-examine option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy: when both are knocked out, worse than either single. Which matches our data. So G1 and G3 are redundant.

But their single mutants have different resistance levels, which is a problem for redundancy. Because redundancy implies that the single mutants should have similar phenotypes.

So that's a contradiction.

So, I think I have to conclude that option D is incorrect.

So, the correct option must be option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but again, what's pleiotropy? Maybe G1 and G3 affect resistance and other traits, but not sure how that relates.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the single mutants have different resistances, which contradicts redundancy.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. But the options don't have an additive option.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as g3. But the data says 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

I think I'm going to have to make a best guess. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, so they're likely in separate pathways.

In the options, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as I thought earlier, that might not fit the data. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the terms.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes can compensate for each other. So when one is knocked out, the other can take over. So the single mutants would have similar phenotypes, but the double mutant would be worse.

In our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so they don't have similar phenotypes. So redundancy is unlikely.

Thus, the correct answer is likely option D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: what's the effect of the double mutants?

The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are as susceptible as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream.

The double mutant g1g3 is more susceptible than either single.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance.

So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. So they're in parallel pathways.

Which would mean that neither is epistatic to the other, but their effects are additive.

But the options don't describe this. Let me look again.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. So in a double mutant, the resistance would be determined by the downstream gene.

Hmm, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option D, G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But the single mutants have different resistances, which is a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I should just go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) contributing to resistance in white lupine against anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and interactions. Key observations and reasoning are as follows:

1. **G2 as the Transcription Factor (TF):**  
   - The single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes, as its knockout eliminates resistance entirely.

2. **G1 and G3 as Downstream Genes:**  
   - The single mutants g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance) show reduced resistance compared to the wild type (100%), indicating that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.  
   - The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, consistent with G2 being upstream and masking the effects of G1 and G3 when absent.

3. **Interaction Between G1 and G3:**  
   - The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, and their combined loss results in a more severe phenotype.  
   - This additive or parallel pathway relationship is inconsistent with redundancy, as redundant genes would have similar single mutant phenotypes, which is not the case here (g1 = 75%, g3 = 50%).

4. **Epistasis Analysis:**  
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the phenotypes of g1g2 and g2g3 match the g2 single mutant.  
   - The relationship between G1 and G3 is less clear. The double mutant g1g3 being worse than either single mutant suggests they are not in the same pathway or that their contributions are additive. Neither is strongly epistatic to the other.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is critical (g2 = 0%), making G2 the TF.  
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While G2 is the TF, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is unsupported. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which contradicts G3 being epistatic to G1.  
- **Option C:** Plausible. G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 showing pleiotropy could explain their independent contributions to resistance. However, pleiotropy typically refers to a gene affecting multiple traits, which is not directly evident here.  
- **Option D:** Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, but their single mutants have different resistance levels (g1 = 75%, g3 = 50%), which contradicts the definition of redundancy. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is not strongly supported by the data.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, likely in separate pathways. While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option C** is the closest, as it aligns with G2 being the TF and G1 and G3 showing independent contributions.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. So, they have three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants and some double mutants. The results are about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild type.

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, we're looking for gene interactions, maybe something like epistasis or redundancy.

The data given is the resistance percentages. Wild type is 100%, which is the control. The mutants have varying resistances:
- g1: 75% → which is 75% of control, so less resistance.
- g2: 0% → no resistance, so more susceptible.
- g3: 50% → half as resistant.
- g1g3: 10% → very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

So, the question is about drawing conclusions from these results. The options are about which gene is the transcription factor and how the others interact.

Hmm. Let's think about what each result implies.

First, when a single gene is knocked out, like g2, the resistance is zero. That suggests that G2 is critical because without it, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So G2 might be a master regulator, perhaps a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

Looking at the other single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance. So both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but G2 is more essential.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the g2 single mutant. So whatever G1 contributes is downstream of G2. If G2 is upstream, then without G2, the absence of G1 doesn't make it any worse—because G2 is already not working. So epistasis here would mean G2 is upstream (epistatic) to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%—same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait, wait. But what about the other double mutant, g1g3, which is 10%. So knocking out both G1 and G3 gives a much lower resistance than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 may contribute independently. If they were redundant, maybe knocking out both would not make it worse than the worse single mutant. But in this case, 10% is worse than either 50% (g3) or 75% (g1). So perhaps they function in separate pathways, and both are needed. Alternatively, they might be additive.

Wait, but what's the role of a transcription factor? If G2 is the transcription factor, then it would regulate the expression of other genes, like G1 and G3. So both G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2.

So if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking out G2 would mean that G1 and G3 aren't expressed either? Or maybe their expression depends on G2.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. So G1 is not the transcription factor because when G1 is knocked out, the plant is still somewhat resistant. Whereas when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. So G2 is the transcription factor (since knocking it out completely eliminates resistance). So that would make G2 the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are probably downstream targets.

But wait, when you have G2 knocked out, you can't make any resistance. So G1 and G3 would not be functional because they're downstream and require G2's regulation.

But wait, the data says that g1 has 75% resistance. So in the absence of G1, the plant is still 75% resistant. That suggests that G1 is not the only gene contributing to resistance. Maybe G2 is the main one, and G3 and G1 are secondary. Or perhaps G1 is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to no resistance. But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are still expressed, but their absence reduces resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, which is 75% of the wild type. So when G1 is knocked out, the plant is 75% as resistant as the wild type. Without G1, they're less resistant, but not completely susceptible. Similarly, without G3, they're 50% resistant.

But without G2, they're 0%—so G2 is necessary for any resistance. So that suggests that G2 is the transcription factor that turns on G1 and G3. Because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to no resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, G3 can still function a bit (since 75% resistance is higher than 50%). Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway.

Wait, but the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So G2 being knocked out is epistatic to G1, meaning G2 is upstream. Similarly, g2g3 is 0% → same as g2, so G2 is upstream of G3.

So the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

Now, how do G1 and G3 interact? Let's look at their double mutant: g1g3 has 10% resistance. The single mutants are 75% and 50%. So the double mutant is more susceptible than either single. So if they were in parallel pathways (each contributing some resistance), knocking out both would reduce resistance further. If they were additive, then 75% + 50% = 125% → but that's not how percentages work. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps they function redundantly. If they are redundant, each provides some level of resistance. But if both are knocked out, the resistance might drop more.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would result in a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. But in our case, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant, because without both, the situation is worse than either alone.

Alternatively, perhaps they work in the same pathway. If G1 is not expressed, the pathway is less active. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and both contribute to the same process. So when both are knocked out, the pathway is completely inactive. But then, why isn't g1g3 zero? It's 10%, so maybe there's another gene that provides a small amount of resistance.

Alternatively, maybe it's epistatic. Let me think about epistasis. If two genes are in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single if they are in series. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than either single, which suggests they are in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So when you knock out both, there's no resistance at all. But why is the double mutant at 10% then? That's a small amount, perhaps due to some other factor.

Wait, but in the presence of G2, the resistance is normal. So G2 is the master TF that activates the other two. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are active. If G2 is not present, then no resistance.

But when you have a g1 mutant (G2 is present), then G3 is active. So the resistance is 75%, which is higher than the g3 mutant (50%). So perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, but without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is expressed, but the resistance is 75% of wild type. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance, and G3 contributes 50% (because when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50% of wild type). So in the wild type, with G2 active, both G1 and G3 are active. So their individual contributions add or multiply.

Wait, perhaps it's multiplicative. If the wild type is 100%, then G1 contributes 75% (so without G1, you lose 25% of resistance), and G3 contributes 50% (so without G3, you lose 50%). But in the wild type, both are active. If they are independent, then maybe the total resistance is something like 75% (G1) multiplied by 50% (G3), but that would be 37.5%, which doesn't fit the data. Hmm, maybe additive? 75% (G1) plus 50% (G3) would be 125%, but the wild type is 100%, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of G1 and G3 each add to the overall resistance. So without G1, you have 50% (G3's contribution) → but wait, in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than G3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps without G1, G3's contribution is 75% of the wild type. Without G3, G1's contribution is 50% of the wild type. So G1 contributes more. So when both are knocked out, you can't get any from either, so that would be 0%? But the g1g3 mutant is 10%, which is not zero. So perhaps there's another gene involved, but that's beyond the question's scope.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Options:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, G2 is a transcription factor? But from the data, g2 is 0%, so G2 is more likely to be the TF. Because the other single mutants don't have 0% resistance. So option A says G1 is TF, which I'm not sure about.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter—so maybe they are co-regulated. Not sure if that's indicated.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. Maybe not directly relevant here.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if you knock out both, the phenotype is worse than either single. Which fits with the g1g3 mutant being 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%). So G1 and G3 are redundant in some way, such that their combined knockout is worse than either alone.

Wait, but what about the epistasis part. Option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. But from the data, in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's phenotype masks G1's. So G2 is epistatic to G1, which would mean G2 is upstream.

Similarly, for G3, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So G2 is the TF, upstream of both G1 and G3. So their phenotypes are masked by the presence of G2 knockout.

Now, looking at the double mutants without G2, like g1g3, which has 10% resistance. So without G2, G1 and G3 cannot be expressed, but perhaps some other factor gives 10% resistance. So G1 and G3 are downstream.

But how do G1 and G3 relate to each other? The double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse, suggesting that they function in parallel pathways, so each contributes some resistance, and without both, the resistance drops more. Alternatively, if they were redundant, then knocking out both would not make the resistance worse than the more severe single knockout. But here, 10% is worse than both 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). So this suggests that they are not redundant, but perhaps work in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function at different steps. So their combined knockout might have a more severe effect.

Wait, but the question is about which option is correct.

Looking at the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, pleiotropy would mean that G1 affects multiple traits, but perhaps not directly relevant here. Maybe instead, they have overlapping functions. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the wild-type, both are functional. If you lose one, the other can compensate, but knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype. Which is what we see in g1g3 (10% < 50% and 75%). So that fits.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have similar phenotypes. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which are different. So that doesn't fit with redundancy because redundant genes would have similar phenotypes when single mutants are made. So that might not hold.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps they are not fully redundant but have additive effects. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: epistasis. The term 'epistatic towards' refers to one gene masking the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a functional G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in this case, when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single. So perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G1's function is downstream of G3.

Wait, no. If G3 is epistatic to G1, that means that G3 is downstream. Because the phenotype of G3 would determine the outcome, regardless of G1. But in our case, the g1g3 double mutant is worse than either single. So that might not fit.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse. So the two genes contribute to resistance in a way that their combined absence makes the plant more susceptible than either alone. This suggests that they are in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, their combined knockout might not have a more severe effect.

Wait, but no, if they're in the same pathway and both contribute, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe effect. For example, if G1 and G3 are both part of a defense pathway, and each contributes a certain amount, then knocking both would lead to a more severe phenotype. So that makes sense.

But how does epistasis come into play?

Wait, the epistatic gene is the one that's upstream. Because the downstream gene's effect is masked. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1 is upstream. So the phenotype of G3 is masked when G1 is knocked out.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So both are knocked out. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to epistasis.

Let me think about the possible options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their single mutants would have similar phenotypes. But in our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. That doesn't fit redundancy. So maybe D is incorrect.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that's relevant here. But perhaps G1 and G3 affect more than one process.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both under the control of G2.

So, in the case of G2 being the TF, G2 activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance. So without G2, both pathways are inactive, leading to no resistance (g2 is 0%).

In the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, so the resistance is 50% of wild type. Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75%. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let's see:

- Wild type: all genes active. Resistance is 100%.

- g1: G1 is knocked out. So only G2 and G3 are active.

But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, resistance is 75% of wild type. So G2 and G3 must be providing 75% of the resistance. So G1 contributes 25% (since 75% is left).

- g3: G3 is knocked out. So G1 and G2 are active. Resistance is 50%, so G1 and G2 are providing 50% of resistance. So G3 contributes 50% of the resistance when active.

Wait, but that can't be. Because in the wild type, all are active. So (G1 + G2 + G3) must equal 100% resistance.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with equations.

Let me denote the contributions:

Let’s say the wild type has 100% resistance, which is the sum of G1, G2, and G3 contributions.

But in reality, the resistance is likely a product of these genes. It's probably more accurate to model it as each gene providing a multiplier.

Wait, but maybe additive would be easier. Let's see.

Assume that each gene contributes additively to the resistance. So:

Wild type: G1 + G2 + G3 = 100% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75% → so G2 + G3 = 75%.

When G3 is knocked out (g3), resistance is 50% → G1 + G2 = 50%.

So, from these two equations:

G2 + G3 = 75 → equation 1

G1 + G2 = 50 → equation 2

So, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(G2 + G3) - (G1 + G2) ) = 75 -50 → G3 - G1 = 25 → G3 = G1 +25.

Now, in the wild type, G1 + G2 + G3 = 100.

From equation 2, G1 + G2 = 50. So G3 = 50. Plugging into equation 1: G2 +50=75 → G2=25.

So G2=25%, G3=50%, G1=25% (since G3=G1+25 → 25+25=50).

Wait, that can't be right because if G2 is 25%, then in the wild type, G1 + G2 (25 +25=50) would be G1 + G2 =50, which matches equation 2. And G2 + G3=25+50=75, which matches equation 1.

So in the wild type, G2 contributes 25%, G1 and G3 contribute 25 and 50 respectively. So total 100%.

But wait, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0% → which would make sense because G2 is 25%, and without it, the other genes (G1 and G3) can't contribute because G2 is the transcription factor. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, hence no resistance.

Ah, that makes sense. So G2 is the TF that activates G1 and G3. So in the knockout mutants, G1 and G3 are not expressed, so their contributions are zero, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. So that means that G1 and G3 are only expressed when G2 is present. Because without G2, they can't be expressed, so their contributions are zero.

So, in the single mutants (g1 and g3), G2 is still active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But in the double mutants (g1g3), G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are expressed, but without either.

Wait, no. Wait, in the double mutants:

g1g2: G1 and G2 are knocked out. So G3 is not expressed because G2 is necessary for its expression. So G3 can't be active. Thus, resistance is 0% (same as g2).

Similarly, g3g2: same as g2.

What about g1g3? Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present. So G2 is expressed, and can activate G1 and G3. But G1 and G3 are knocked out, so they can't be expressed. So without G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%. Hmm. Where does this 10% come from? Maybe from another gene that is not dependent on G2. Or perhaps the 10% is due to some basal resistance without G1 and G3. But that's beyond the current data.

Wait, but according to our earlier model, the contribution of G1 and G3 are additive. So in the wild type, G2 is 25%, G1 is 25%, G3 is 50%. So total 100%.

In the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out. So G2 is 25%, G3 is 50% → 75% → which matches the data.

In the g3 mutant, G3 is knocked out. So G2 is 25%, G1 is 25% → 50% → which matches the data.

In g1g3, both are knocked out. So only G2's 25% remains. But wait, the data says 10%. Which is less than 25%. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Maybe the model isn't additive but multiplicative. Let's try that.

Assume that each gene contributes a multiplicative factor to resistance.

So wild type: G1 * G2 * G3 = 100%.

g1: G2 * G3 = 75%.

g3: G1 * G2 = 50%.

g1g3: G2 =10%.

So let's model this.

From g1: G2 * G3 =75 → equation 1.

From g3: G1 * G2 =50 → equation 2.

From g1g3: G2 =10 → equation 3.

Wait, wait. Wait, in g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so only G2 remains. So the resistance is equal to G2's contribution. But according to the data, it's 10%, which would imply that G2 contributes 10%. But in the wild type, with all three genes, the resistance is 100%. So perhaps the multiplicative model isn't correct either.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the epistasis.

We know that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because the double mutants g1g2 and g3g2 are as severe as g2. So G2 is upstream. So G2 is the transcription factor.

Now, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Without both, resistance drops more.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the phenotypes of g1 and g3 are different, so redundancy might not fit.

Option A: G1 is TF, which doesn't fit because g2 has 0% resistance, so G2 is more likely the TF.

So the correct option should have G2 as the TF.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter suggests they are co-regulated. If both are regulated by G2, which is the TF, that makes sense. But why would G3 be epistatic to G1? That would mean G3's position is downstream. But without G3, the resistance is worse.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, for G3, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

So G2 is epistatic to both, meaning G2 is upstream.

Now, about the relationship between G1 and G3.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So in the presence of G2, but without G1 and G3.

So in the wild type, with G2 active, both G1 and G3 are active, contributing to resistance. So G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps. Or in different pathways.

Wait, but in the double mutant, they have 10% resistance, which is much less than either single. So perhaps each contributes about 25% and 50%, and without both, only 10% is left. Maybe due to another gene, but perhaps it's a small contribution.

Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me go back to the options.

Option D says G1 and G3 have gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in our data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. So redundancy doesn't fit. So D is likely incorrect.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure. Pleiotropy isn't about redundancy or epistasis, but about a gene affecting multiple traits. Not directly relevant here.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So they are co-regulated by G2. So when G2 is active, both are expressed. When G2 is inactive, neither is expressed. But the data shows that in single mutants (g1 and g3), the other gene is expressed (since g1 has 75% which is higher than g3's 50%). So G3's contribution is more than G1's. So perhaps G3 has a stronger effect when G2 is active.

But I'm still not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not in the same promoter. So they're regulated independently but both by G2.

In any case, the key points are: G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. Now, the question is about their relationship.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3 (10%) again. Since each single mutant (g1:75%, g3:50%) is better than g1g3, their combined absence has a worse effect. So G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a way that their combined loss has a more severe effect. So perhaps they function in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance.

So, their functions are additive. So, without G1, you lose some resistance (75%), without G3, you lose more (50%). But without both, you lose almost all (10%).

But how does this relate to epistasis?

Epistasis is about the relationship between two genes where the phenotype of one masks the effect of the other. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps either G1 or G3 is epistatic to the other. But without knowing more, it's hard to say.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should have G2 as the TF, and G1 and G3 being downstream. It should also describe the relationship between G1 and G3.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But the data doesn't fit redundancy.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which I'm not sure about.

Option B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulation), and G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3 is downstream. But why would G3 being knocked out not affect the epistatic relationship?

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G3 is downstream. So in a double mutant, the effect of G1 is masked by G3's knockout.

Wait, but in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single. So if G3 is downstream of G1, knocking out both would have a worse effect than either. That seems to fit.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure about pleiotropy. Maybe I should think about what each option states.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the epistatic gene (G1) would determine the phenotype. But in the double mutant, the phenotype is worse than either single, which doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic. Because if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant should look like the more severe single mutant.

Wait, no. Because if G1 is epistatic to G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's presence or absence doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be the same as g1 (if G1 is epistatic). But in our data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be determined by G3. So if G3 is knocked out, the resistance would be the same as g3 (50%). But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the epistatic relationships.

When you have two genes in the same pathway, their double mutant may not be worse than the more severe single mutant. For example, if you have a linear pathway, knocking both out may not change the phenotype beyond the most severe single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is worse, which suggests they are in separate pathways.

So, if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both regulated by G2.

Now, considering epistasis: since G2 is upstream of both, it's epistatic to both. Between G1 and G3, perhaps neither is epistatic to the other, but they function in parallel.

But the options require a conclusion about their relationship.

The question is asking which conclusion can we draw regarding the genes' interactions.

Looking at the options again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which doesn't fit because their single mutants have different resistances.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which I'm not sure about.

Option A is wrong because it says G1 is the TF.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. So if G3 is epistatic, that would mean that the presence of G3 determines the phenotype. So in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So if G3 is epistatic, the g1g3 double mutant should be the same as g3 (50%). But according to data, it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding epistasis. Epistasis only refers to the position in the pathway. For example, if G3 is downstream of G1, then G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as the more severe single mutant.

But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either single, which would not fit if one is epistatic. So perhaps the correct answer is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but function in parallel.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them say that. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, let me think again. The question asks which conclusion can be drawn.

Given that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are downstream, but their double mutant is worse than either, perhaps they are in separate pathways.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That doesn't fit because their single mutants have different effects.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But earlier analysis suggests redundancy doesn't fit the single mutant data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think again.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then when either is knocked out, the other can compensate. But when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further. That's what the data shows: g1g3 is 10% < 50% and 75%. So that fits redundancy. So option D might be correct.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the single mutants should have similar phenotypes. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. That's different.

So that contradicts redundancy. So option D is probably incorrect.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to sum up.

The data indicates:

- G2 is the TF, as its knockout leads to 0% resistance, while others don't.

- G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

- The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, suggesting they contribute additively or are in separate pathways.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

The options that have G2 as TF are B, C, D.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. I don't think that's supported, because the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't know enough about pleiotropy to make a call.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant. The data doesn't fit that.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but what's pleiotropy? It means a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I ruled that out because G2 is the TF.

Wait, let me re-examine option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy: when both are knocked out, worse than either single. Which matches our data. So G1 and G3 are redundant.

But their single mutants have different resistance levels, which is a problem for redundancy. Because redundancy implies that the single mutants should have similar phenotypes.

So that's a contradiction.

So, I think I have to conclude that option D is incorrect.

So, the correct option must be option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but again, what's pleiotropy? Maybe G1 and G3 affect resistance and other traits, but not sure how that relates.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the single mutants have different resistances, which contradicts redundancy.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. But the options don't have an additive option.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as g3. But the data says 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

I think I'm going to have to make a best guess. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, so they're likely in separate pathways.

In the options, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as I thought earlier, that might not fit the data. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the terms.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes can compensate for each other. So when one is knocked out, the other can take over. So the single mutants would have similar phenotypes, but the double mutant would be worse.

In our data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so they don't have similar phenotypes. So redundancy is unlikely.

Thus, the correct answer is likely option D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: what's the effect of the double mutants?

The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are as susceptible as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream.

The double mutant g1g3 is more susceptible than either single.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance.

So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. So they're in parallel pathways.

Which would mean that neither is epistatic to the other, but their effects are additive.

But the options don't describe this. Let me look again.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. So in a double mutant, the resistance would be determined by the downstream gene.

Hmm, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option D, G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But the single mutants have different resistances, which is a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I should just go with option D.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) contributing to resistance in white lupine against anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and interactions. Key observations and reasoning are as follows:

1. **G2 as the Transcription Factor (TF):**  
   - The single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes, as its knockout eliminates resistance entirely.

2. **G1 and G3 as Downstream Genes:**  
   - The single mutants g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance) show reduced resistance compared to the wild type (100%), indicating that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.  
   - The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, consistent with G2 being upstream and masking the effects of G1 and G3 when absent.

3. **Interaction Between G1 and G3:**  
   - The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, and their combined loss results in a more severe phenotype.  
   - This additive or parallel pathway relationship is inconsistent with redundancy, as redundant genes would have similar single mutant phenotypes, which is not the case here (g1 = 75%, g3 = 50%).

4. **Epistasis Analysis:**  
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as the phenotypes of g1g2 and g2g3 match the g2 single mutant.  
   - The relationship between G1 and G3 is less clear. The double mutant g1g3 being worse than either single mutant suggests they are not in the same pathway or that their contributions are additive. Neither is strongly epistatic to the other.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is critical (g2 = 0%), making G2 the TF.  
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While G2 is the TF, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is unsupported. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which contradicts G3 being epistatic to G1.  
- **Option C:** Plausible. G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 showing pleiotropy could explain their independent contributions to resistance. However, pleiotropy typically refers to a gene affecting multiple traits, which is not directly evident here.  
- **Option D:** Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, but their single mutants have different resistance levels (g1 = 75%, g3 = 50%), which contradicts the definition of redundancy. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is not strongly supported by the data.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, likely in separate pathways. While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option C** is the closest, as it aligns with G2 being the TF and G1 and G3 showing independent contributions.

ANSWER: C
