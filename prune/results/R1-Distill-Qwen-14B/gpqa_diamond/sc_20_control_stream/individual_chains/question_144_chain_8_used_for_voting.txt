Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a particle decays, the mean decay distance depends on how long it lives on average. The longer it lives, the further it can travel before decaying.

The question gives me some values: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so that's probably on the scale of subatomic particles.

Wait, I think the mean proper lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The formula I think is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or similar.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me recall its value. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is a big unit, so when we use ħ in GeV·s, that makes sense.

So, first, I need to convert Γ from MeV to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.0569e-24 seconds. Wait, but wait, no, wait a second. I thought the formula was τ = ħ / (Γ). Wait, but actually, in natural units where ħ = 1, Γ is the inverse of the lifetime. So the formula is correct.

Wait, but wait another point. I think the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that's right.

So τ would be (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let's compute that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Right.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime τ, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But the particle is moving, so we need to calculate the mean decay length as observed in the lab frame. So we need to calculate the velocity of the particle and then the distance it travels in that time.

To find the velocity, I can use the energy and mass. The production energy E is 8 GeV. But wait, the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving relativistically. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but for a meson, which is a boson, but probably we can treat it as a relativistic particle.

The energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, actually, the equation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E in units where c=1 is sqrt(p^2 + m^2).

But I need to get the velocity. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the Lorentz gamma factor γ.

Alternatively, I can compute the velocity from the energy and mass. Let me think. The energy E is given. So E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, I need to make sure the units are compatible. Wait, perhaps in natural units where c=1, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². So E in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E = γ m. So γ = E/m = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is approximately 6.6667. Then, the velocity β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, actually, β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). So let's compute 1/γ²: (1/ ( (8/1.2) )² ) = ( (1.2/8) )² = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887c. So v ≈ 0.9887 * c.

Ok, so the particle's speed is about 0.9887 times the speed of light. Now, the mean decay length L is v multiplied by the lifetime τ. But wait, the lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So the lab frame lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma, because of time dilation. Oh wait, right! So the actual lifetime observed in the lab frame is γ * τ.

Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer. So the time during which it travels is t = γ τ. And the distance is L = v * t = v * γ τ.

Alternatively, since v is approximately β c, we can write L = β γ c τ.

But let's make it precise. So let's compute each step.

First, calculate τ: 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, calculate γ: 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666..., approximately 6.6667.

Then, calculate β: sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ≈ 0.9887 as I found before.

So, the mean decay length L is:

L = v * t_lab

v = β c

t_lab = γ τ

So, L = β c γ τ.

Plugging in the numbers:

β ≈ 0.9887

c ≈ 3e8 m/s

γ ≈ 6.6667

τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 0.9887 * 6.6667: approximately 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887.

6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈?

Well, 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.6667 * 0.9887 = 0.66

Wait, perhaps better to compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:

6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * (1 - 0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - (6.6667 * 0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - 0.0755 ≈ 6.5912.

Wait, 6.6667 * 0.0113 is approximately 0.0755.

So 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5912.

Wait, but that gives the product of beta and gamma. So beta * gamma ≈ 6.5912.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.9887 * 6.6667 → 0.9887 * 6.6667:

6.6667 = 20/3.

0.9887 * 20/3 = (0.9887 *20) /3.

0.9887 *20 = 19.774.

19.774 /3 ≈ 6.5913.

Yes, so about 6.5913. So beta*gamma ≈ 6.5913.

Now multiply by c (3e8 m/s) and tau (2.056875e-24 s).

So L = (6.5913) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the order is (beta * gamma) * c * tau.

Wait, no, actually, the correct expression is L = (beta gamma c tau).

Wait, so:

beta * gamma = 6.5913,

c = 3e8 m/s,

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.5913 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Let me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 first.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 6.5913:

6.170625e-16 * 6.5913 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.170625 * 6.5913 ≈ approximately 40.65.

Because 6 * 6.5 is 39, and 0.17*6.59 is about 1.12, so total around 40.12.

Wait, 6.170625 * 6.5913 → let's compute more accurately.

6 * 6.5913 = 39.5478.

0.170625 *6.5913 = approx 1.1208.

So total is 39.5478 + 1.1208 = 40.6686.

So 40.6686e-16 meters? Wait, no, because the exponent is 1e-16. Wait, wait, 6.170625e-16 *6.5913 = (6.170625 *6.5913) * 1e-16.

Which is approximately 40.6686e-16 m, which is 4.06686e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So our calculation is approximately 4.066e-15, which is very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, let's recap:

Gamma (Γ) = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Energy E =8 GeV, mass m =1.2 GeV.

Gamma factor γ = E/(m c²) but in units where c=1 and E in GeV, m in GeV/c², so γ = 8/1.2 = 6.6667.

Beta (β) = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, βγ = 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈6.5913.

Compute L = βγc τ.

c =3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So:

L = 6.5913 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.5913: 6.170625e-16 *6.5913 ≈40.668e-16 = 4.0668e-15 m.

Which is 4.0668e-15 m. So the closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps a more precise calculation for beta would get a more accurate result. Let's recalculate beta more accurately.

gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (6.6666667)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444.

1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) → let's compute this more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.9775)?

Well, 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

Hmm, which is less than 0.9775. Let's try 0.9885.

0.9885^2 = (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 ≈ (0.988)^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

So 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.977132.

Still less than 0.9775.

Next, 0.9887.

0.9887^2 = let's compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

= (0.988 * 0.988) + (0.988 * 0.0007) + (0.0007 *0.988) + 0.0007^2.

Wait, better to compute directly:

0.9887 *0.9887:

= (0.9887)^2 = let's think in terms of (a + b)^2 where a=0.988, b=0.0007.

(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

a² = (0.988)^2 = 0.976144.

2ab = 2 *0.988 * 0.0007 = 0.0013832.

b² = 0.0007^2 = 0.00000049.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.0013832 = 0.9775272 + 0.00000049 ≈0.9775277.

Which is just a bit above 0.9775. So 0.9887^2≈0.9775277, which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So perhaps a more precise value is 0.9887.

So beta * gamma = approx 6.5913.

Wait, but perhaps a more precise calculation of beta would give a slightly different product.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the approximation is sufficient.

So the mean decay distance is about 4.066e-15 m, which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, the options are:

A)5.0223 *10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

So option B is the correct answer.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the relationship between the decay width $\Gamma$, the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, the speed of light $c$, and the relativistic gamma factor $\gamma$. The steps are as follows:

1. **Proper Lifetime Calculation**:  
   The proper lifetime $\tau$ is given by:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   where $\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}$ and $\Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV}$. Substituting:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Gamma Factor**:  
   The gamma factor $\gamma$ is calculated using the energy $E$ and mass $m$ of the particle:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
   \]

3. **Beta Factor**:  
   The beta factor $\beta$ is derived from $\gamma$ using:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
   \]  
   Substituting $\gamma = 6.6667$:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Distance**:  
   The mean decay distance $L$ is given by:  
   \[
   L = \beta \gamma c \tau,
   \]  
   where $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. Substituting the values:  
   \[
   L = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
   \]  
   First, calculate $\beta \gamma$:  
   \[
   \beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913.
   \]  
   Then, calculate $c \tau$:  
   \[
   c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
   \]  
   Finally, multiply:  
   \[
   L = 6.5913 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 40.668 \times 10^{-16} = 4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated mean decay distance is approximately $4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$, which matches option **B** ($4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$).

Answer: B
