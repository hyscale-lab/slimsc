Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So the question involves two reactions with different starting materials, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The options give different peak numbers for each case, and I need to determine what the chemist observes.

First, I should recall what mCPBA does. mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that it's a peracid, and peracids are commonly used as oxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. 

But wait, does the reaction stop there? Oh, right, after the epoxidation, the question says the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, that's important. Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening reactions. So the epoxide formed from each starting alkene will be treated with acid, leading to further reaction.

Now, I need to think about the starting materials: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. These are geometric isomers, differing in the configuration around the double bond. The reaction with mCPBA will form epoxides, and the position of the epoxide depends on the alkene structure.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on each are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The same goes for the (Z) isomer, but the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Wait, but epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA is a stereospecific reaction. It adds the oxygen across the double bond in a way that forms the epoxide without changing the geometry of the substituents. So the (E) and (Z) alkenes will form different epoxides because their starting structures are different.

After the epoxide is formed, the next step is treatment with aqueous acid. Acid catalyzed epoxide ring-opening typically involves the attack of a nucleophile—water in this case. The epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then, a water molecule attacks the more substituted carbon (since in a three-membered ring, the more substituted carbon is more electrophilic due to more adjacent C-H bonds) leading to ring opening. Or wait, is it the less substituted? Hmm, I think it's the more substituted because the more substituted carbon has higher electron deficiency. Wait, no, the more substituted carbon in an epoxide is more stabilized, but during ring-opening, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon. So in trans epoxides, the attack can happen from either side, leading to possible diastereomers or different products.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the epoxide structure.

When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide that forms will have the two new oxygen atoms attached to C4 and C5, with the substituents on either side. Since the starting alkene is E, the groups on either end of the double bond (like CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3 maybe?) are opposite each other. So the epoxide would have a specific configuration.

Similarly, the (Z) isomer would form an epoxide where the substituents on either end are on the same side.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out in my mind. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I think oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me correct: for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, no, wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. Octene has 8 carbons, so oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's better to write the structure as CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's longer. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just think that for both (E) and (Z) isomers, the epoxide will form between C4 and C5, leading to an epoxide group there.

Now, when each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens. For each epoxide, the acid will protonate the oxygen, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Water will attack from the opposite side of the leaving group (since it's a nucleophilic attack), leading to ring opening.

But wait, the configuration of the epoxide (from E vs Z starting alkenes) will influence the possible diastereomers formed upon acid treatment.

Wait, okay, let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → (E)-epoxide. Then acid hydrolysis.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → (Z)-epoxide. Then acid hydrolysis.

Wait, no, actually, when mCPBA epoxidizes an alkene, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will have the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, the (Z) would form a cis epoxide.

But wait, the epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, so the configuration of the starting alkene's substituents determines the configuration of the epoxide.

So when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the substituents on either side of the double bond (like the two CH2CH2CH3 groups) are trans, so the epoxide will have those substituents trans to each other. Similarly, for (Z), the substituents are cis, so the epoxide substituents are cis.

Now, when each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, what happens?

In acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon of the epoxide because that's more electrophilic. Wait, or is it the less hindered carbon? Hmm, the more substituted epoxide oxygen is adjacent to a more substituted carbon, which is more stabilized, but during ring-opening, the attack occurs at the less substituted carbon because it's less hindered. Wait, I think it's the more substituted carbon because the adjacent substituents can stabilize the transition state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: in epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, which makes the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic due to more adjacent R groups, but the more substituted carbons are more hindered. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because the transition state is better stabilized by the adjacent R groups. So in an epoxide like cyclohexene oxide, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon.

So in each case, the attack is at the more substituted carbon, leading to the formation of a diol. But wait, the substitution in the epoxide may influence which carbon is more substituted.

Wait, in both cases, the epoxide is on C4 and C5 of octene. For (E)-epoxide, substituents on C4 and C5 are trans; for (Z), they are cis. So, each epoxide is symmetrical? Wait, no, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. But maybe the substituents on either end of the double bond are both CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)3CH-CH2-CH2-(CH2)3CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, let's say oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. So, the molecule is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, which is 8 carbons with the double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond has a CH2 group on one side and a CH2CH2CH3 on the other? Wait, no, perhaps each end is CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe it's better to consider that each epoxide is symmetric, but I'm not sure.

But assuming that the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the acid treatment leads to the same product in each case. But wait, no, because the starting epoxide's stereochemistry is different.

Wait, no, the epoxide's configuration (cis or trans) affects the way the ring opens. So let's consider each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → (E)-epoxide → upon acid, forms a diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → (Z)-epoxide → upon acid, forms a diol.

Wait, but when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide and the way the ring opens.

In the case of (E)-epoxide, which has the substituents trans, the attack by water could happen from either side, leading to possibly different diastereomers. Similarly, for (Z)-epoxide, the attack would be from a specific side due to the cis arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a single diastereomer because the attack is specific.

Wait, perhaps the attack occurs such that the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Since the epoxide is symmetrical, maybe each reaction gives a single product. Or maybe not.

Wait, let me think about the possible outcomes. For each epoxide, when opened under acidic conditions, the product is a diol. If the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be the same regardless of which side is attacked.

Wait, no, because the epoxide's configuration (cis or trans) would affect the diol's configuration.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide ring-opening leads to two diastereomers. Or maybe each leads to one diastereomer.

Wait, no, wait. If the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and thus would not be chiral.

Wait, so maybe each epoxide, upon ring-opening, forms a single product which is a meso diol. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack would produce a diol with two stereocenters that are mirror images, leading to a meso compound.

But wait, let's think about the actual structure.

Assuming the epoxide is between C4 and C5, and each of those carbons has two CH2 groups attached. So, the epoxide structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe I should simplify.

Wait, let me imagine that the epoxide is formed from oct-4-ene, which is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. So, the epoxide would be between C4 and C5, making the structure:

CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the epoxide as being between C4 and C5, so the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-CH(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the epoxide would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CH-O-CH-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. No, that's not correct. The epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the structure would be:

O
||
C4-O-C5

with each C4 and C5 attached to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2CH2CH3.

No, wait, that's not a ring. The correct structure for an epoxide from oct-4-ene would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but as a three-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but the O is connecting C4 and C5 in a three-membered ring.

In any case, for the (E) and (Z) epoxides, each would have the substituents on the same or opposite sides.

Now, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. The attack occurs at the more substituted carbon.

If the epoxide is symmetric, then both attack possibilities would lead to the same product. But if it's asymmetric, then the attack would lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, but in the case of (E)-epoxide, suppose the substituents on either side of the epoxide are opposite each other. So, when the ring opens, the attack can happen from either face, leading to different diastereomers.

Similarly, for (Z)-epoxide, the substituents are on the same face, so the attack would be specific.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think in terms of diastereomers and possible products.

Each epoxide (from E and Z) will form a diol upon acid treatment. For each starting epoxide, how many diastereomers are formed?

In the case of (E)-epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions could lead to two enantiomers, or perhaps just one product.

Wait, no, because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack from either face would lead to the same product. But if the epoxide isn't symmetric, attack from either face would lead to different products.

Wait, but for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are both CH2 groups on one side and longer chains on the other? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe each epoxide is not symmetric. Let me think: For (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on each side of the double bond are CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3, but trans. So the epoxide would have these groups on opposite sides. When the epoxide ring opens, the attack could be from either side, leading to two different diastereomers.

Wait, but if the substituents are the same on both ends, then the epoxide would be symmetric, and the diol would be a meso compound, hence achiral.

Similarly, for the (Z)-epoxide, if the substituents are same on both ends and cis, then the ring-opening would lead to a meso diol as well.

Wait, but in that case, both reactions would produce the same meso diol, so combining them wouldn't give any new products. But that can't be right, because the starting materials are different.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming the substituents are the same. Let me think again about the structure of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene.

The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, which is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, actually, the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait: Each end of the double bond has a CH2 group on one side and a longer chain on the other?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, with the double bond between the 4th and 5th carbon.

So, each end of the double bond is connected to a CH2 group and a longer chain (like three CH2 groups).

Wait, perhaps each end is a CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

In any case, perhaps the substituents on each end are the same, making the epoxide symmetric.

If that's the case, then the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene would be symmetric, and when treated with acid, would form a single diol which is a meso compound. Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide would also be symmetric, and upon treatment with acid, would also form the same meso diol.

But wait, that can't be right because the starting materials are different. So maybe I'm wrong in assuming the substituents are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end of the double bond are different. For example, one end has a CH2CH2CH3 group and the other has a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. No, that's not correct because octene has eight carbons. Wait, perhaps one end is CH2CH2CH2 (three CH2 groups) and the other is CH2CH2CH2CH3 (four CH2 groups), but wait, that would make the molecule longer. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps each end of the double bond is a CH2CH2CH3 group, making the epoxide symmetric. So when (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene react, they form symmetric epoxides that, when treated with acid, each produce a single meso diol. But that would mean that both reactions produce the same diol, which doesn't make sense because the starting materials are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on each side of the double bond are the same, so the epoxide is symmetric. Therefore, when treated with acid, it forms a single meso diol. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is also symmetric, leading to the same meso diol. But that would mean that both Reaction 1 and 2 produce the same diol, which would then be combined. But the question says the chemist combines the products of both reactions. So if both products are the same, the combined product is just that one diol. But that can't be correct because the problem suggests that when they are run on HPLC, multiple peaks are observed.

So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and the substituents on each end of the double bond are different.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each end are different. For example, on (E)-oct-4-ene, one end has a CH2CH2CH3 group and the other has a longer chain.

Wait, but how can that be? Let me count the carbons again.

Oct-4-ene: CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that's only seven carbons because the double bond is between C4 and C5. No, wait, oct-4-ene has eight carbons: the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond would be CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3 on both ends, which would make the epoxide symmetric.

Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene is symmetric, leading to a meso diol upon acid treatment. Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide would also be symmetric, leading to the same meso diol.

Wait, but that would imply that both reactions produce the same product, which would mean the combined product is a single diol. So when run on HPLC, standard and chiral columns would show different peak numbers.

But the question says that the products of both reactions are combined. So if each reaction produces the same product, then the mixture would just be that one product.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the HPLC would show only one peak for both standard and chiral columns. But none of the options match that. The options suggest two or three peaks, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe each epoxide leads to two different diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the epoxide is symmetric is incorrect. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each end of the double bond are different. For example, one end is a CH2CH2CH3 group and the other end is a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. But that would make the molecule longer than eight carbons. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end are different, making the epoxide asymmetric. So, when the epoxide is treated with acid, the attack can occur from either face, leading to different diastereomers.

Wait, let's consider that each epoxide is asymmetric. Then, each reaction (E and Z) would produce two diastereomers. But wait, maybe each reaction produces only one diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to two diastereomers, but when the epoxide is symmetric, the diastereomers are identical, leading to a single product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: think about the possible products of each reaction and see how many different compounds are formed.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (E) → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (Z) → acid → diol.

Each diol may have different stereochemistry.

Wait, let's think about the diol products.

In the epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the diol formed will have two new stereocenters. The configuration of these stereocenters depends on the attack direction and the configuration of the epoxide.

If the epoxide is symmetric, such as from (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol formed will be a meso compound. For example, 4,5-diol-octane as a meso compound, which is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

Similarly, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound.

Wait, but in that case, both Reaction 1 and 2 would produce the same meso diol, so combining them wouldn't change anything. But that leads to only one product, which would give a single peak on standard HPLC and a single peak on chiral HPLC, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. So Reaction 1 produces two diastereomers, and Reaction 2 produces two different diastereomers, leading to a total of four products. Or perhaps each reaction produces one diastereomer.

Alternatively, maybe each epoxide leads to two enantiomers, but if the molecule is symmetric, they are the same, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-epoxide, when treated with acid, forms a diol that is a single meso compound, which is achiral. Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide forms a diol that is also a single meso compound, which is the same as the first. So both reactions give the same product, leading to a single diol in the mixture.

But that again leads to only one product, which doesn't match any of the options provided.

Wait, perhaps the diol from each reaction is different. Let me think:

If the starting alkene is (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed is trans. When treated with acid, the diol formed has two adjacent stereocenters which are trans to each other, making it a meso compound, which is achiral.

Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide would form a diol where the stereocenters are cis, but if the molecule is symmetric, that would also be a meso compound. But wait, no— if the substituents are the same on each end, then the diol from (Z)-epoxide would still be a meso compound.

Wait, but that would mean that both reactions produce the same meso diol, hence the same product.

Therefore, the combined products would be a single diol. So when run on standard HPLC (achiral), it would show one peak. On chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since the diol is meso and thus achiral, it would also show one peak.

But none of the options match this scenario. The options suggest 2,3,4 peaks. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and the diols are different.

Alternative approach: perhaps each reaction produces two different diastereomers.

Wait, if the epoxide is asymmetric, the attack could happen from either face, leading to two different diastereomers.

But in the case of (E)-epoxide, perhaps the substituents are asymmetric, leading to two diastereomers upon ring-opening.

Similarly, for (Z)-epoxide, the substituents are symmetric, leading to a single meso diol.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the substituents are symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, but if they're asymmetric, the diol could have two enantiomers, which would be a pair of diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps for the (E)-epoxide, the substituents are same on both ends, leading to a meso diol. For the (Z)-epoxide, the substituents are same on both ends, leading to another meso diol, which is the same as the first. But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to two diastereomers. So each reaction produces two diastereomers. Then, combining both reactions would give four diastereomers. But that's not possible because some might be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two enantiomers, but if the molecule is symmetric, the enantiomers would be identical, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-epoxide leads to a diol with two stereocenters that are trans, making it a meso compound. The (Z)-epoxide leads to a diol where the stereocenters are cis, which, if the molecule is symmetric, would also be a meso compound. So both reactions give the same meso diol, leading to a single product.

But again, that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

Each epoxidation would lead to a specific diastereomer of the epoxide, and upon acid treatment, each would lead to a specific diastereomer of the diol.

Wait, but in reality, the diastereomer of the epoxide would determine the possible diastereomers of the diol.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. So Reaction 1 gives two products, and Reaction 2 gives two more, leading to four in total. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces one diastereomer, leading to two products in total. So when combined, two diastereomers would form. Then, on the standard HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, each diastereomer would appear as one peak. On the chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would appear as separate peaks, but if the diastereomers are not chiral, it might not separate them.

Wait, but diastereomers are different compounds and would appear as separate peaks on any HPLC, regardless of chirality.

So if there are two diastereomers, the standard HPLC would show two peaks. The chiral HPLC would also show two peaks, because it's the diastereomers that are separated, not just enantiomers.

But looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC. That would fit if there are two diastereomers.

But wait, let's go back to the reaction. For each epoxide, how many diastereomers are formed upon acid treatment?

If the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed is a meso compound. So Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each would produce a meso diol, which is achiral. So the combined product would have only one component, hence one peak on both HPLCs. But this isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to four products in total.

Wait, but that would require that each epoxide leads to two diastereomers, which would happen only if the epoxide is asymmetric.

So, if the epoxide is asymmetric, the attack can happen from either face, leading to two diastereomers. Similarly, for the other reaction.

But if the epoxide is symmetric, the attack from either face leads to the same product, a meso diol.

So, putting it all together:

- Reaction 1: (E)-epoxide is symmetric, leading to one meso diol.

- Reaction 2: (Z)-epoxide is symmetric, leading to another meso diol.

Wait, but if both epoxides are symmetric, the diols would be the same, meaning the mixture has only one product.

But this doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, making four products in total. But that seems unlikely because the starting materials are different.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the product diols.

When (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized and then treated with acid, the diol formed would have specific stereochemistry. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a different diol.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to a total of four products, which would show four peaks on both HPLC columns. But looking at the options, option D says 3 and 4 peaks, which doesn't fit. Option A says 4 and 4. That could be possible.

But the options don't include 4 peaks for both. Option A is 4 and 4. So, is that a possibility?

Wait, if each reaction produces two diastereomers, combining them would give four products. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diastereomer, but the diastereomers from each reaction are different, leading to two products in total. Then, standard HPLC would show two peaks, and chiral HPLC would also show two, as the diastereomers are not enantiomers. So option C.

But earlier I thought that if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound. So perhaps each reaction produces one product, but they are different, leading to two products in total.

Wait, let's try to summarize:

- Reaction 1: (E)-epoxide → diol A (meso, maybe).

- Reaction 2: (Z)-epoxide → diol B (another meso, maybe).

But if diol A and diol B are different, then combining them would give two products.

In that case, the standard HPLC would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well, because each diol is a different compound, possibly achiral, so no enantiomers, but diastereomers would appear as separate peaks on any HPLC.

But that would mean option C: 2 peaks in both HPLC.

Alternatively, if each reaction produces two diastereomers, then four products in total. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the products are not meso compounds but are chiral. Let me think again.

Suppose the substituents on the epoxide are not the same on both ends. Then, the attack from either face would lead to two diastereomers, which are enantiomers if the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but if the molecule is chiral, then each epoxide leads to two enantiomers of diol, which are the same as each other, leading to a single product (meso) only if the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

Wait, perhaps each reaction leads to two diastereomers, but since the starting materials are different, they might produce different diastereomers. So combining them would give four products.

So the standard HPLC would show four peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show four peaks because each diastereomer is a separate compound. But looking at the options, option A says 4 peaks for both, which is possible.

But I'm not sure. Another way to approach this is to think about the actual reactions.

Wait, when (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The (E) means the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. Then, under acid conditions, the epoxide opens. The diol formed would have two adjacent stereocenters, which could be trans (if the attack is from opposite faces) or cis (if same face).

Wait, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. So, the diol would be chiral and have two enantiomers.

Wait, but if the diol is a meso compound, it's achiral. So, whether the diol is meso depends on the configuration of the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a racemic mixture of diols. But since each reaction goes to 100% completion, perhaps only one diastereomer is formed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible diastereomers.

In the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are trans. The resulting epoxide is trans. Upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol with adjacent stereocenters. The configuration of these centers depends on the attack direction.

If the epoxide is trans, the diol formed may have the two stereocenters in a trans configuration, making it a meso compound.

Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide would form a diol with the two stereocenters in a cis configuration, which would be a meso compound as well.

Wait, if both diols are meso, then combining them would give a single product. But that's not possible because they're from different starting materials.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the diol being meso. Let me think: For (E)-epoxide, the substituents on each end are opposite, leading to the diol having opposite configurations on each stereocenter, making it meso.

For (Z)-epoxide, the substituents are same side, leading to the diol having same configurations on each stereocenter, which would also make it meso.

Wait, but if the substituents are same on each end, the diol would be meso regardless of the epoxide's configuration.

Hmm, perhaps both diols are meso and thus achiral, leading to a single product. But that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to four products in total. Then, when run on standard HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, each diastereomer would be a separate peak. On chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, each enantiomer would be a separate peak, but if the diastereomers are different, they would also appear as separate peaks.

Wait, but if each reaction produces two enantiomers, combining both would give four enantiomers (but perhaps some are same), but this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two different diastereomers, leading to four products. So the standard HPLC would show four peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show four, as each diastereomer is a different compound. So option A would be correct.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about the possible products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (E) → acid → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (Z) → acid → diol B.

If diol A and diol B are diastereomers, then the mixture would have two diastereomers. So on standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, which can differentiate enantiomers, but diastereomers are already different, so also two peaks. So option C.

But earlier I thought each reaction might produce two diastereomers, but perhaps each reaction produces only one diastereomer, which is different from the other reaction.

In that case, the combined mixture would have two diastereomers, each appearing as one peak on any HPLC.

So the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: perhaps each reaction produces one diastereomer, but the diastereomers from each reaction are different, leading to two products.

Thus, the standard HPLC (achiral) would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks because the diastereomers are different compounds, hence separated.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The products are then analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each case.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide leads to the formation of a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide and the direction of nucleophilic attack.

2. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**:
   - The (E)-isomer forms a trans-epoxide. Under acidic conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. The diol has two stereocenters, and the stereochemistry depends on the attack direction. Since the molecule is symmetric, the diol formed is a meso compound, which is achiral.

3. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**:
   - The (Z)-isomer forms a cis-epoxide. Under acidic conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. Similar to Reaction 1, the diol has two stereocenters. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the diol formed is also a meso compound, which is achiral.

4. **Combining Products**:
   - Both reactions produce meso diols. However, the diols from the (E)- and (Z)-epoxides are different compounds. Thus, the combined product mixture contains two distinct diastereomers.

5. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers are separated into distinct peaks. Since there are two diastereomers, two peaks are observed.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns can separate enantiomers, but the diols are meso compounds (achiral). Therefore, the two diastereomers are separated into two peaks based on their distinct chemical structures.

### Conclusion:
The standard HPLC and chiral HPLC each show two peaks, corresponding to the two diastereomers formed in the reactions.
