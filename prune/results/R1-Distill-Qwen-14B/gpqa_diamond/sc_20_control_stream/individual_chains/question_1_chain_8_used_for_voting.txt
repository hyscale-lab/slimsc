Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are given. The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds respectively. The task is to determine what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish them.

Wait, energy difference and lifetimes? I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

So the idea is that the energy difference between the two states needs to be detectable given their lifetimes. The lifetimes are like the time uncertainty Δt for each state, right? Because the states don't exist forever; they have a finite lifetime, so there's a spread in time.

Wait, but which Δt do I use here? Each state has a different lifetime. Oh, wait, I think the energy uncertainty is related to the lifetime. Specifically, the broader the lifetime (the longer the lifetime), the smaller the energy uncertainty. Because if something exists for a longer time, you can measure its energy more precisely.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) would be roughly ħ divided by the lifetime (Δt). So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 seconds. For E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but what exactly are we trying to find? The energy difference between E2 and E1, ΔE. So to clearly distinguish the two, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, I think. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart. So we need ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, each state's energy uncertainty is based on its own lifetime. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*Δt1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2). So the total uncertainty when looking at the difference between E2 and E1 would be ΔE_total ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2 because they're independent. So the energy difference between the two should be greater than this total.

Let me compute that. Let's get the values right. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes, when working with eV and seconds, it's useful to use the conversion 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So let's see.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the uncertainty for each state. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * Δt1)
Δt1 = 1e-9 s.
ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = approx 5.27e-26 J.

Hmm, but that's in joules. I need to convert that to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so dividing by that gives the energy in eV.

So 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is for Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2) = (1.0545e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = 5.27e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because a longer lifetime (Δt2 bigger) should lead to a smaller energy uncertainty. Oh, yes, because ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, which is smaller than ΔE1's 3.29e-7 eV. So that makes sense.

So the uncertainty in E2 is about 3.3e-8 eV, and in E1 it's about 3.3e-7 eV. So the total uncertainty when considering the difference between E1 and E2 would be the sum of the two, right? Because each has their own uncertainty, and when you take the difference, the uncertainties add up. So total uncertainty would be approximately 3.3e-7 + 3.3e-8 = 3.63e-7 eV.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, when you subtract E1 and E2, the uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes people just add them because they're independent, but I'm a bit shaky on that.

Wait, the energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So when you take E2 - E1, the uncertainty in that difference is sqrt( (ΔE2)^2 + (ΔE1)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent and uncorrelated.

So let's compute that. ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So (ΔE1)^2 = (3.29e-7)^2 ≈ 1.08e-13 (eV)^2.
(ΔE2)^2 = (3.29e-8)^2 ≈ 1.08e-15 (eV)^2.

Adding them gives 1.0908e-13 (eV)^2. Taking the square root, sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, that's the same as just adding them because ΔE2 is much smaller than ΔE1. Because (3.29e-7) is much larger than (3.29e-8), so in reality, the uncertainty is dominated by the larger term. So perhaps the total uncertainty is approximately 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, the question is asking for the energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) that would allow us to clearly distinguish the two levels. So we need ΔE to be greater than this uncertainty.

So ΔE should be greater than 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → 1e-9 is smaller than 3.3e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → which is 1e-4, which is larger than 3.3e-7. So that would be acceptable.

D) 1e-8 eV → also smaller than 3.3e-7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the calculation I did for ΔE1 and ΔE2 may have some approximations. Let me recalculate the exact values.

Compute ΔE1:

Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 J / (1.60217663e-19 J/eV) = approximately (5.272859e-26) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So that's correct.

ΔE2: Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) = sqrt( (1.08e-13) + (1.08e-15) ) ≈ sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be larger than 3.3e-7 eV to distinguish the two. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.3e-7 eV. So that's way above the uncertainty. So it would be clearly distinguishable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. Our calculated uncertainty is around 3.3e-7 eV, which is 0.00000033 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is smaller than 3.3e-7. So not enough; the energy difference would be within the uncertainty, making it hard to distinguish.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV, because it's well above the uncertainty.

Wait, but wait. The question says "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any energy difference larger than the uncertainty is acceptable. So option C is way above, so it's definitely clear. Are there other options that are above the uncertainty?

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → less than 3.3e-7.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → much larger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV < 0.00000033, so no.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~3.3e-7 eV. Option C is the only one that satisfies that.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the uncertainty principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \Delta t \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Total uncertainty in the energy difference
The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties, assuming they are independent:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the energy difference for clear resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} < 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} < 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} > 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} < 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be greater than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the options, only \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) satisfies this condition.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the uncertainty for each state. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * Δt1)
Δt1 = 1e-9 s.
ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = approx 5.27e-26 J.

Hmm, but that's in joules. I need to convert that to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so dividing by that gives the energy in eV.

So 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is for Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2) = (1.0545e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = 5.27e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because a longer lifetime (Δt2 bigger) should lead to a smaller energy uncertainty. Oh, yes, because ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, which is smaller than ΔE1's 3.29e-7 eV. So that makes sense.

So the uncertainty in E2 is about 3.3e-8 eV, and in E1 it's about 3.3e-7 eV. So the total uncertainty when considering the difference between E1 and E2 would be the sum of the two, right? Because each has their own uncertainty, and when you take the difference, the uncertainties add up. So total uncertainty would be approximately 3.3e-7 + 3.3e-8 = 3.63e-7 eV.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, when you subtract E1 and E2, the uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes people just add them because they're independent, but I'm a bit shaky on that.

Wait, the energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So when you take E2 - E1, the uncertainty in that difference is sqrt( (ΔE2)^2 + (ΔE1)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent and uncorrelated.

So let's compute that. ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So (ΔE1)^2 = (3.29e-7)^2 ≈ 1.08e-13 (eV)^2.
(ΔE2)^2 = (3.29e-8)^2 ≈ 1.08e-15 (eV)^2.

Adding them gives 1.0908e-13 (eV)^2. Taking the square root, sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

Compute ΔE1:

Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 J / (1.60217663e-19 J/eV) = approximately (5.272859e-26) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So that's correct.

ΔE2: Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) = sqrt( (1.08e-13) + (1.08e-15) ) ≈ sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be larger than 3.3e-7 eV to distinguish the two. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.3e-7 eV. So that's way above the uncertainty. So it would be clearly distinguishable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. Our calculated uncertainty is around 3.3e-7 eV, which is 0.00000033 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is smaller than 3.3e-7. So not enough; the energy difference would be within the uncertainty, making it hard to distinguish.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV, because it's well above the uncertainty.

Wait, but wait. The question says "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any energy difference larger than the uncertainty is acceptable. So option C is way above, so it's definitely clear. Are there other options that are above the uncertainty?

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → less than 3.3e-7.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → much larger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV < 0.00000033, so no.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~3.3e-7 eV. Option C is the only one that satisfies that.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the uncertainty principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \Delta t \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Total uncertainty in the energy difference
The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties, assuming they are independent:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the energy difference for clear resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} < 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} < 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} > 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} < 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \), not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be greater than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the options, only \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) satisfies this condition.
