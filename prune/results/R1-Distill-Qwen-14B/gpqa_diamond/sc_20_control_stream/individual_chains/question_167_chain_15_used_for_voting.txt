Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states or squeezed states, which have Wigner functions that are Gaussian distributions. Non-Gaussian states have non-Gaussian Wigner functions, and they're important in quantum optics and quantum computing because they can't be described by Gaussian operations alone.

The non-Gaussianity here is calculated using the relative entropy of entanglement or something similar. Oh right, the relative entropy measure given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state. So del_b is the difference in the von Neumann entropies between rho and tau.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because I remember that for some measures, the non-Gaussianity is calculated by comparing the state to the closest Gaussian state, but here the reference is given as a Gaussian state tau. So I need to calculate the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state rho and this particular Gaussian state tau.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure as defined. So I need to find del_b.

But first, what's the structure of the state |psi>? It's a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, right? Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, and tau probably is the density matrix of a Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is a pure state, and tau is a Gaussian state. What's the simplest Gaussian state to compare to? Maybe the closest Gaussian state in some sense, like the one with the same first and second moments, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain.

Wait no, maybe the reference is a Gaussian state whose density matrix is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho. Or perhaps tau is the density matrix of the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the state |psi>. It's a superposition of two coherent states, which when you square it, produces a Wigner function that's non-Gaussian, like two humps or something.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state, and its von Neumann entropy is zero because it's pure. Wait, no, wait. The von Neumann entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). For a pure state, rho is a projector, so rho^2 = rho, meaning ln rho is zero for the eigenvalues (since for a pure state, rho has eigenvalues 0 and 1), so S(rho) is 0. But wait, no. Wait, if rho is a pure state, then the von Neumann entropy is zero because it's a rank-1 projector. So -Tr(rho ln rho) would be zero. Wait, because the eigenvalues are 1 and 0, so ln(1) is 0 and ln(0) is undefined, but in the trace, only the non-zero eigenvalues contribute. So S(rho) is zero.

But the relative entropy measure is del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)]. So if rho is pure, then S(rho)=0, and del_b = - S(tau). But wait, that can't be right; perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, the problem defines del_b as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Hmm, wait, no, that would be S(rho) - S(tau). But wait, wait. The von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). So, in del_b, if that's [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], that would actually be negative of [S(rho) - S(tau)].

Wait, the problem says: del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That is, S(rho) is -trace(rho ln rho), so the given del_b is - (S(rho) - S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). But since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity is equal to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But wait, that can't be right because S(tau) is a property of tau, not of the non-Gaussian state. So maybe I misunderstood the definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in this problem, the definition is given as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which would be S(rho) - S(tau) multiplied by -1. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the problem says:

del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

So, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is - trace(rho ln rho), so trace(rho ln rho) = - S(rho). Similarly for tau, trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). So del_b becomes (- S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho).

But since rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, so del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity would be the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau. But wait, how do I find tau?

Wait, no. The definition says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So, what reference Gaussian state are they using? Because the del_b is calculated as S(rho) - S(tau), but the way the problem defines it, del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So for a pure state, S(rho)=0, so del_b = S(tau).

Wait, so the non-Gaussianity is S(tau). But then, what is tau?

Hmm, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the Gaussian state with the same first moments and second moments as rho. Alternatively, it could be the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense.

Wait, but in the case of the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the expectation values of position and momentum are the same as the original coherent states because of symmetry. So for |alpha> and |-alpha>, perhaps the average is zero. Hmm, because if alpha is real, then |alpha> and |-alpha> have real displacements. So the expectation values would be zero, as (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha|)/2 would have zero mean, but our state is a superposition, not a mixture.

Wait, but wait, the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). For phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, with alpha = 0.5, so alpha² is 0.25. exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the problem again.

So, to calculate del_b, I need to find the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau, where tau is a Gaussian state. But since rho is a pure state, its entropy is zero, so del_b would equal the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But wait, that can't be right because the non-Gaussianity should depend on the state's non-Gaussian features. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula reversed.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), which is the standard relative entropy. But in the problem statement, it's given as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is different.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using some form where del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)] but with a negative. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about what the non-Gaussianity means.

Non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. One approach is to compare the state to the 'best' Gaussian approximation, perhaps the one with the same first and second moments.

But perhaps in this case, the state is a pure state, and the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximally mixed state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state |alpha> or |-alpha>, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, let's consider the case where phi is such that sin(2 phi) is zero. Then N is 1, and the state becomes (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/1. If phi is 0, then it's just |alpha>, which is a coherent (Gaussian) state. So the non-Gaussianity should be zero in that case.

Looking at the options, option D is 0. So if phi is such that the state is Gaussian, del_b should be zero, but wait, that's when the state is a coherent state, right.

Wait, but the problem gives phi = -pi/4. Let's compute 2*phi: that's -pi/2. So sin(2 phi) is -1. So N is sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

But perhaps the key here is that for a coherent state, the non-Gaussianity is zero, but for a superposition of coherent states, it's non-zero.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. So perhaps when the state is Gaussian, del_b is zero, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but the state here is a superposition of two coherent states. So in that case, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero, which would rule out option D.

But wait, perhaps the relative entropy as defined would be zero only when rho and tau are the same state. So if the state |psi> is the same as a Gaussian state tau, then del_b would be zero.

But |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, so unless tau is a non-Gaussian state, which it's not.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the structure of rho and tau.

The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho = |psi><psi|.

The reference Gaussian state tau would have the same first moments and perhaps the same second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments fully determine the state.

Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a. So the expectation value <a> for a coherent state |alpha> is alpha. For the state |psi>, what is <a>?

|psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So <a> would be [ cos^2(phi) <alpha|a|alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a| -alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha |a |alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha |a | -alpha> ] / N^2.

But <alpha|a|alpha> = alpha, and < -alpha |a| -alpha> = -alpha. What about the cross terms?

< alpha | a | -alpha > is the expectation value of a when the state is | -alpha >, but projected into |alpha>. Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value <a> for |psi>.

Psi is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so the expectation value <a> is [ cos(phi)^2 alpha + sin(phi)^2 (-alpha) + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) < -alpha |a | alpha> ] / N^2.

Wait, but for coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. The inner product <alpha | -alpha> is exp( -|alpha|^2 - | -alpha |^2 + alpha (-alpha)* + (-alpha) alpha* ) )?

Wait, the inner product between |alpha> and |beta> is exp( -|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta + (beta* alpha)/2 ). So for alpha and -alpha, this becomes exp( -|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 + (- alpha^2) + (alpha^2)/2 )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The inner product <alpha | beta> for coherent states is e^{ - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha^* beta + (beta^* alpha)/2 }.

Wait, no, the general expression is <alpha|beta> = exp( -|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha^* beta ). So for alpha and -alpha, the inner product is exp( -|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2/2 + alpha^* (-alpha) ) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute |alpha> and |beta> = |-alpha>.

So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( -|alpha|^2/2 - | -alpha |^2/2 + alpha^* (-alpha) ). Since |alpha|² = |beta|².

So it's exp( - |alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2/2 + (- |alpha|^2) )? Wait, wait no: Wait, |beta|^2 is the same as |alpha|^2.

So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - |alpha|^2/2 - |alpha|^2/2 + alpha^* (-alpha) )

= exp( - |alpha|^2 + (- |alpha|^2) )

= exp( - 2 |alpha|^2 + (- |alpha|^2) )? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the exponent is:

- (|alpha|² + |beta|²)/2 + alpha^* beta.

In our case, beta is -alpha.

So the exponent becomes:

- ( (|alpha|^2) + (| - alpha |^2) ) /2 + alpha^* (- alpha )

= - ( |alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2 ) / 2 + (- |alpha|^2 )

= - ( 2 |alpha|^2 ) / 2 - |alpha|^2

= - |alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2

= -2 |alpha|^2.

So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( -2 |alpha|^2 ).

Wait, that's interesting. So the inner product between |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp( -2 |alpha|^2 ).

So going back to the expectation value <a> for |psi>:

< a > = [ cos^2(phi) alpha + sin^2(phi) (-alpha) + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha | a | -alpha> + < -alpha | a | alpha> ] ] / N².

So what's <alpha | a | -alpha>?

The annihilation operator a acting on | -alpha > gives (-alpha)| -alpha >. So <alpha | a | -alpha > = (- alpha) < alpha | -alpha >.

Which is (- alpha) exp( -2 alpha² ).

Similarly, < -alpha | a | alpha > = (- alpha) < -alpha | alpha >.

But < -alpha | alpha > is the same as < alpha | -alpha >, which is exp(-2 alpha²).

So < -alpha | a | alpha > = (- alpha) exp( -2 alpha² )

Therefore, the cross terms:

cos(phi) sin(phi) [ (- alpha) exp(-2 alpha²) + (- alpha) exp(-2 alpha²) ) ] = cos(phi) sin(phi) [ - 2 alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ]

So putting it all together:

< a > = [ cos^2(phi) alpha - sin^2(phi) alpha - 2 alpha cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

Factor alpha:

= alpha [ cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) - 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

Simplify cos^2 - sin^2: that's cos(2 phi).

And 2 cos phi sin phi is sin(2 phi).

So < a > = alpha [ cos(2 phi) - sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N².

Now, N^2 is (1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²) ).

So substituting phi = - pi/4.

phi = -pi/4. So 2 phi = -pi/2.

So cos(2 phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0.

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So < a > becomes:

alpha [ 0 - (-1) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / [1 + (-1) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

Simplify numerator: alpha [ exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

Denominator: 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So < a > = [ alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

Wait, let's compute this with alpha=0.5.

alpha=0.5, so alpha^2=0.25.

exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So numerator: 0.5 * 0.6065 ≈ 0.30325.

Denominator: 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935.

So <a> ≈ 0.30325 / 0.3935 ≈ approximately 0.77.

Wait, but that's the expectation value. Now, for the second moments, like <a²>, which for Gaussian states is needed to compute the entropy.

But perhaps it's easier to consider what the reference Gaussian state tau would be. Because the relative entropy may require knowing the entropy of tau, which depends on its properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments determine the state.

So, to find tau, which is a Gaussian state with the same <a> and <a²> as rho.

Wait, but rho is a pure state, and for a Gaussian state, the second moments are determined by the first moments and the state's purity.

Wait, perhaps for a Gaussian state tau, with the same <a> as rho, and the same <a^2>, then tau would be the best Gaussian approximation (BGA) of rho.

So, for the state |psi>, compute <a> and <a²>, and construct a Gaussian state tau with these moments, then compute the entropy S(tau), and since rho is pure (S(rho)=0), del_b would be S(tau).

So let's compute <a> and <a²> for rho.

We already computed <a> as approximately 0.77.

Now, let's compute <a²>.

The expectation value <a²> for rho is Tr(rho a²).

Since rho is |psi><psi|, <a²> = < psi | a² | psi >.

So, <psi | a² | psi> = [ cos(phi) < alpha | + sin(phi) < -alpha | ] [ a² ( cos(phi) | alpha > + sin(phi) | -alpha > ) ] / N².

Expanding this, we get:

cos^2(phi) < alpha | a² | alpha > + cos(phi) sin(phi) < alpha | a² | -alpha > 
+ sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a² | alpha > 
+ sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a² | -alpha >.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's break it down.

Each term would be:

Term1: cos²(phi) < alpha | a² | alpha >.

Term2: cos(phi) sin(phi) < alpha | a² | -alpha >.

Term3: sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a² | alpha >.

Term4: sin²(phi) < -alpha | a² | -alpha >.

We can compute each term.

For Term1: < alpha | a² | alpha > = alpha².

For Term4: < -alpha | a² | -alpha > = (-alpha)^2 = alpha².

Terms 2 and 3: < alpha | a² | -alpha > and < -alpha | a² | alpha >.

We can compute these using the properties of coherent states. The expectation value < alpha | a² | beta > can be found in some textbooks, but I'm not sure of the exact formula.

Wait, I think that for coherent states, a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>.

So, a² |alpha> = alpha² |alpha> + sqrt(2) alpha |alpha>, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute < alpha | a^2 | beta > using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula or displacement operators. Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value < alpha | a^2 | beta > can be found as alpha² < alpha | beta > + something else.

Wait, another approach: a² |beta> = a (a |beta>) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta (beta |beta> ) = beta² |beta> + sqrt(2) beta |beta>, but this seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of the inner product.

Wait, for a general state |beta>, a² |beta> = (a a)|beta> = (beta a + 1) |beta>? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the expectation value <alpha| a² |beta> in terms of alpha, beta, and <alpha|beta>.

Wait, the expectation value <alpha | a² | beta> can be expressed as alpha² <alpha|beta> + other terms involving the commutators.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that <alpha | a^2 | beta> = (beta^2) <alpha|beta> + something else.

Wait, perhaps using ladder operators:

a |beta> = beta |beta>.

So, a² |beta> = a (a |beta> ) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta * (beta |beta> ) ) = beta² |beta> + something else? No, wait, that's not correct. Because a |beta> is beta |beta>, so a² |beta> would be (a * a) |beta> = a ( beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta * (beta |beta> ) = beta² |beta> .

Wait, but that can't be right because a² |beta> = a (a |beta> ) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta (beta |beta> ) = beta² |beta>.

So < alpha | a^2 | beta> = < alpha | beta² | beta> = beta² < alpha | beta >.

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me test with beta = alpha. Then <alpha | a^2 | alpha> = alpha² < alpha | alpha> = alpha² * 1 = alpha². That's correct.

Similarly, < alpha | a^2 | -alpha> = (-alpha)^2 < alpha | -alpha> = alpha² * exp(-2 alpha^2).

So, now, let's compute each term.

Term1: cos²(phi) * alpha².

Term2: cos(phi) sin(phi) * ( (-alpha)^2 ) <alpha| -alpha> ) = cos(phi) sin(phi) * alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

Term3: sin(phi) cos(phi) * (alpha^2) < -alpha | alpha > ) = sin(phi) cos(phi) * alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

Term4: sin²(phi) * alpha^2.

So summing all terms:

< a^2 > = [ cos²(phi) alpha² + cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin²(phi) alpha^2 ] / N².

Factor out alpha^2:

alpha^2 [ cos²(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin²(phi) ] / N^2.

The expression in the brackets is (cos(phi) + sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) )^2.

Wait, let me check:

(cos(phi) + sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) )^2 = cos²(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin²(phi) exp( -4 alpha^2 ).

Wait, no, that's not matching. Because in our case, the third term is 2 cos sin exp(-2 alpha^2), but in the square it would be exp(-4 alpha^2) in the last term. So perhaps that approach doesn't help.

But let's proceed.

So, <a^2> = [ alpha^2 [ cos²(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin²(phi) ] ] / N^2.

Now, let's plug in phi = -pi/4.

phi = -pi/4.

cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) = 2 * (sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) ) = 2 * (-2/4) ) = -1.

So the expression in the brackets becomes:

cos²(phi) + (-1) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin²(phi).

But cos² + sin² =1, so 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So <a^2> = [ alpha^2 (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

Because N^2 is [1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

With sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So <a^2> becomes [ alpha^2 (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = alpha^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So <a^2> for rho is alpha^2, same as for a coherent state.

But wait, that can't be right. Because the state is a superposition, so the expectation value of a^2 shouldn't be the same as a coherent state.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me check again. When I plug in phi = -pi/4 into the expression inside the brackets:

cos²(-pi/4) + 2 cos(-pi/4) sin(-pi/4) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin²(-pi/4).

cos²(-pi/4) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5.

Similarly, sin²(-pi/4) = 0.5.

2 cos sin exp(...) = 2*(sqrt(2)/2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) * exp(...) = 2*(-2/4)* exp(...) = - exp(...).

So the sum is 0.5 - exp(-2 alpha^2) + 0.5 = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So the <a^2> becomes [ alpha^2 (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)) ] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

The (1 - exp(...)) terms cancel, so <a^2> = alpha^2.

Wait, that's unexpected. So for this state |psi>, the expectation value of a² is the same as for a coherent state. So the first and second moments are the same as a coherent state.

Wait, but then tau would be a coherent state with <a> equal to <a> for rho and <a²> equal to alpha². Because for a coherent state, <a²> = alpha², but when |alpha> is the state, <a> is alpha. But in our case, <a> is approximately 0.77 when alpha is 0.5.

So, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a coherent state with <a> equal to the calculated <a> of rho, which is (alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ) / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ).

So, let me compute that.

With alpha=0.5, exp(-2 alpha^2 ) is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So numerator: 0.5 * 0.6065 ≈ 0.30325.

Denominator: 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935.

So <a> ≈ 0.30325 / 0.3935 ≈ approximately 0.771.

So the reference Gaussian state tau is a coherent state with alpha = 0.771.

Wait, but wait. Coherent states have <a> = alpha. So if tau is a coherent state, then alpha_tau = <a> = 0.771.

So, the density matrix for tau would be the density matrix of the coherent state |alpha_tau> where alpha_tau ≈ 0.771.

But wait, is tau a coherent state or a squeezed state? Because the problem says tau is a reference Gaussian state, which could be any Gaussian state. But perhaps in this case, since the first and second moments match those of a coherent state, tau is the coherent state with alpha = <a>.

So, the entropy S(tau) for a coherent state is zero because it's a pure state. But wait, no, a coherent state is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. But wait, no, because here tau is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho, which is a pure state. But wait, if tau is a coherent state, which is a pure state, then S(tau)=0.

But earlier, we found that del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Since S(rho)=0 and S(tau)=0, del_b would be zero. But this can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that tau is a coherent state. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not a coherent state but a different Gaussian state.

Wait, but if the first and second moments are the same as those of a coherent state, then tau would be a coherent state, because Gaussian states are uniquely determined by their first and second moments. Because for Gaussian states, the density matrix is completely determined by <a>, <a†>, and <a²>, <a†²>, etc. So if tau has the same first and second moments as a coherent state, then tau is that coherent state.

But then, del_b would be S(tau) - S(rho) = 0 - 0 = 0, which would suggest the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the earlier reasoning.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the calculation of <a^2> for rho.

Wait, when I computed <a^2>, I ended up with <a^2> = alpha², which is the same as a coherent state. So if the first and second moments are the same as a coherent state, then tau is a coherent state. Thus, S(tau) = 0, and del_b = 0.

But looking at the options, option D is 0. So would the answer be D) 0?

But wait, this can't be right because the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states and thus is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should not be zero.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe the reference Gaussian state isn't the one with the same first and second moments. Maybe it's the completely mixed Gaussian state.

Wait, another thought: the relative entropy measure as given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

But since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho) = - S(rho) = 0.

So del_b = 0 - Tr(tau ln tau) = - S(tau).

Wait, that would imply del_b is negative, but non-Gaussianity is a positive measure, so perhaps I'm missing a negative sign in the definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the definition is del_b = [Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

But the problem states it's Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

In that case, for rho being pure, Tr(rho ln rho) = - S(rho) = 0, so del_b = - S(tau).

But since S(tau) is positive, del_b would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a non-Gaussianity measure, which should be positive.

This suggests I may have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for non-Gaussianity using relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). In that case, since rho is pure and tau is a mixed Gaussian state, S(rho || tau) would be positive.

But the problem's definition is different, so perhaps I should proceed with what is given.

But given the confusion, perhaps the answer is zero because the state's first and second moments match a Gaussian state's. Thus, the non-Gaussianity is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is zero because when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is a coherent state. But that doesn't make sense because |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state becomes ( sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ) / N.

Which is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / sqrt(2) * 1/N.

But N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

sin(2 phi) is -1, so N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

So the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which as discussed earlier, is non-Gaussian.

So perhaps the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

But according to the earlier calculation of <a^2>, it's the same as a coherent state, which would imply that the Gaussian state tau is a coherent state with the same <a> as rho. But rho's <a> is not alpha, so tau is a different state, but a coherent state.

So if tau is a pure coherent state, then S(tau) is zero, so del_b = 0 - 0 = 0, which would suggest the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that can't be right.

I'm stuck here. Maybe I should consider another approach. Perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a cat state, but under certain conditions, the non-Gaussianity is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the state is actually Gaussian.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But wait, a squeezed state is a superposition of coherent states? No, squeezed states are Gaussian, and their Wigner functions are Gaussian.

Wait, no. Squeezed states are Gaussian, but the state |psi> in the problem is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but if the state |psi> has the same moments as a coherent state, then it's Gaussian. But that's only possible if the state is a coherent state, which it isn't because it's a superposition.

Wait, no. The moments could look the same as a coherent state without the state being a coherent state. For example, two different non-Gaussian states could have the same first and second moments as a coherent state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in our case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states. So for it to have the same <a> and <a²> as a coherent state, it must be that the superposition is such that these moments are the same.

But earlier, the calculation shows that <a^2> is alpha^2, same as a coherent state. So perhaps |psi> is actually a coherent state under certain conditions.

Wait, let's see: if the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

When would this state be a coherent state?

Well, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. For |psi> to be a coherent state, it must satisfy a|psi> = lambda |psi>, where lambda is a complex number.

Let me compute a|psi>:

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |alpha> + sin(phi) a |-alpha> ] / N.

Since a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, and a |-alpha> = (- alpha) |-alpha>.

So,

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) alpha |alpha> + sin(phi) (-alpha) |-alpha> ] / N.

= alpha [ cos(phi) |alpha> - sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Compare this to |psi>:

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So for a |psi> to be lambda |psi>, we have:

alpha [ cos(phi) |alpha> - sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N = lambda [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So, this implies that:

alpha cos(phi) = lambda cos(phi),

alpha (- sin(phi) ) = lambda sin(phi).

From the first equation: alpha cos(phi) = lambda cos(phi).

If cos(phi) is not zero, then lambda = alpha.

From the second equation: - alpha sin(phi) = lambda sin(phi).

Substituting lambda=alpha: - alpha sin(phi) = alpha sin(phi).

=> - alpha sin(phi) - alpha sin(phi) = 0.

=> -2 alpha sin(phi) )= 0.

Which implies that either alpha=0 (trivial coherent state), or sin(phi) = 0.

So, when sin(phi)=0, phi is 0 or pi, etc.

At phi=0, |psi> reduces to |alpha>, which is a coherent state.

Similarly, at phi=pi, |psi> becomes |-alpha>, another coherent state.

But for other phi values, |psi> is not a coherent state.

So, in our case, phi is -pi/4, so |psi> is not a coherent state and is non-Gaussian.

But earlier, the calculation of <a> and <a²> suggests that the first and second moments are the same as a coherent state with alpha' = <a> ≈ 0.771.

So, the reference Gaussian state tau would be a coherent state with alpha = 0.771, which is a pure state, hence S(tau)=0.

But rho is also a pure state, so del_b = 0 - 0 = 0.

But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian. So perhaps the issue lies in the calculation of <a²>.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating <a²>.

Let me go back.

When I computed <a²> for rho, I found it to be alpha^2, same as a coherent state. Let me check again.

Earlier steps:

< a² > = [ alpha^2 (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / [ N^2 (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ].

Which simplifies to alpha^2.

So, <a²> = alpha^2 for rho.

But for a coherent state |beta>, <a^2> = beta^2.

So, if rho's <a^2> is beta^2, and <a> is not beta, but some other value, that would imply that rho is a Gaussian state only if it's a coherent state. But this leads to a contradiction, which suggests that the initial assumption may be wrong.

Wait, but how can a non-Gaussian state have the same <a> and <a²> as a coherent state? Because for a Gaussian state, these moments determine the state uniquely. So if rho has the same <a> and <a²> as a coherent state, rho must be a coherent state, which can't be because it's a superposition.

Therefore, perhaps my earlier calculation of <a²> is incorrect.

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation of <a²>.

Earlier, I found that:

< a² > = [ alpha² (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)) ] / [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ]

Which simplifies to alpha².

But that can't be correct because if the state is a superposition, the expectation value should differ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the terms for <a²>.

Let me redo the calculation.

The expectation value <a^2> is:

[ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a^2 |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a^2 |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) <-alpha| a^2 |alpha> + sin^2(phi) <-alpha|a^2 |-alpha> ] / N^2.

Each term:

Term1: cos^2(phi) <alpha|a²| alpha> = cos^2(phi) * alpha².

Term4: sin^2(phi) <-alpha| a^2 | -alpha> = sin^2(phi) * alpha^2.

Term2 and Term3:

Term2: cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a^2 |-alpha> = cos(phi) sin(phi) * (-alpha)^2 <alpha| -alpha> = cos(phi) sin(phi) * alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

Term3: sin(phi) cos(phi) <-alpha|a^2 |alpha> = sin(phi) cos(phi) * alpha^2 < -alpha | alpha> = sin(phi) cos(phi) * alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

So all terms summed:

= [ cos²(phi) alpha² + sin²(phi) alpha^2 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

Factor out alpha^2:

= alpha^2 [ cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

But cos² + sin² =1, so:

= alpha^2 [ 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

Now, N^2 is 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2).

With phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So,

N^2 = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So substituting:

< a² > = alpha^2 [ 1 + 2 cos(-pi/4) sin(-pi/4) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Compute cos(phi) sin(phi):

cos(-pi/4) sin(-pi/4) = (sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) )= - (2/4) )= - 0.5.

So,

< a² > = alpha^2 [ 1 + 2*(-0.5) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

= alpha^2 [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Which simplifies to alpha^2.

Hmm, so that brings me back to the same conclusion: <a^2> = alpha^2.

Which suggests that the state rho has the same <a> and <a^2> as a coherent state, but it's a non-Gaussian state. That's a contradiction because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments uniquely determine the state. So, rho cannot be a non-Gaussian state if it shares the same moments as a coherent state.

But then, this implies that rho is actually a coherent state, which is impossible because rho is a superposition. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating <a>.

Let me re-calculate <a>:

Earlier, I had:

< a > = [ alpha ( cos(2 phi) - sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

With phi = -pi/4, cos(2 phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0.

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So,

< a > = [ alpha (0 - (-1) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

= [ alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ).

For alpha = 0.5:

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So numerator: 0.5 * 0.6065 ≈ 0.30325.

Denominator: 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935.

So <a> ≈ 0.30325 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.771.

So <a> is about 0.771, which is not alpha (0.5).

So, for rho, <a> = 0.771, <a^2> = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

For a coherent state |beta>, <a> = beta and <a^2> = beta^2.

So if tau is the coherent state |beta>, where beta = <a> ≈ 0.771, then <a^2> for tau would be beta^2 ≈ (0.771)^2 ≈ 0.594.

But for rho, <a^2> is 0.25, which is not equal to 0.594.

So, this implies that tau cannot be a coherent state because the second moments don't match.

Hmm, so my earlier assumption was wrong. Therefore, the reference Gaussian state tau is not a coherent state.

Wait, but this means I need to find a Gaussian state tau that has the same <a> and <a²> as rho.

But for Gaussian states, the variance is <a²> - <a>^2.

In rho, the variance is <a²> - <a>^2 = 0.25 - (0.771)^2 ≈ 0.25 - 0.594 ≈ -0.344.

Wait, variance can't be negative. That's impossible. Therefore, this suggests that my calculation is wrong because variance can't be negative.

So perhaps I made a mistake in computing <a²> or <a>.

Wait, let me reevaluate <a^2>:

Earlier calculation:

< a² > = alpha^2 / N^2 [ 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

Wait, but for phi = -pi/4, 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) is -1, as before.

So,

1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So,

< a² > = alpha^2 [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

But N^2 is 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So,

< a^2 > = alpha^2 [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = alpha^2.

So <a^2> is alpha^2.

But wait, <a> is 0.771, so <a>² is approximately 0.771^2 = 0.594.

Thus, the variance is <a^2> - <a>^2 = 0.25 - 0.594 = -0.344, which is impossible.

This suggests that the earlier calculation must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for <a^2>.

The correct calculation should include all terms correctly. Let me redo <a^2>.

Expanding <a²>:

< a² > = [ cos^2(phi) alpha^2 + cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin^2(phi) alpha^2 ] / N^2.

Because <alpha|a^2| -alpha> is alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) as we found earlier.

So, combining the terms:

= [ alpha^2 (cos²(phi) + sin^2(phi) ) + 2 alpha^2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

= [ alpha^2 (1) + 2 alpha^2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

= alpha^2 [ 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

But with phi = -pi/4, 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) = -1.

So,

= alpha^2 [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

But N^2 = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So,

= alpha^2 [ 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] = alpha^2.

Thus, <a²> = alpha^2.

So, the variance is <a²> - <a>² = alpha² - ( [alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / [1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ] )^2.

Which, for alpha=0.5, would be 0.25 - (0.30325/0.3935)^2 ≈ 0.25 - (0.771)^2 ≈ 0.25 - 0.594 ≈ -0.344, which is impossible.

This suggests that the state |psi> cannot exist, which can't be the case.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of <a>.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express <a> in terms of the given parameters.

< a > = [ alpha ( cos(2 phi) - sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

Wait, let me compute this again.

cos(2 phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0.

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So,

< a > = [ alpha (0 - ( -1 ) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ] / N^2.

= [ alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / N^2.

But N² is 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 + (-1) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2).

So,

< a > = [ alpha exp(-2 alpha^2) ] / (1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ).

With alpha = 0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2 )= exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So,

< a > ≈ (0.5 * 0.6065) / (1 - 0.6065) = (0.30325) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.771.

So, <a> = 0.771, <a^2> = 0.25.

Thus, the variance is 0.25 - (0.771)^2 ≈ 0.25 - 0.594 ≈ negative, which is impossible. So, this suggests that the state |psi> is not correctly defined, which can't be the case.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm calculating <a> and <a^2>. Because for the state |psi>, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the expectation values may not simply be additive due to cross terms. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is actually a coherent state when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. Let me check.

Wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states displaced in opposite directions. Under certain conditions, this could form another coherent state.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state |psi> becomes a coherent state.

Let me think: if the superposition is symmetric in some way, perhaps it forms a different coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps when the two terms in the superposition have equal magnitude, the state becomes a coherent state.

Wait, but in our case, the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), which at phi=-pi/4 are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2, respectively.

So |psi> = ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2) * 1/N.

But N is sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, perhaps under these conditions, the state is a coherent state. But earlier analysis suggested it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But that's not the case here because it's a superposition.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a thermal state, but that's also a Gaussian state.

Wait, but if the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, then its non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Given the confusion and time constraints, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian under the given parameters.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state |psi> is a coherent state. Let me see:

If |psi> is a coherent state, then a|psi> = alpha |psi>.

But earlier, when I computed a|psi>, it didn't satisfy this condition unless sin(phi) is zero.

So, in this case, phi is not zero, so |psi> is not a coherent state.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the calculation, the state's first and second moments match those of a coherent state, which is Gaussian. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity measure would be zero, which is option D.

But earlier, I found that the variance is negative, which is impossible, suggesting an error in the calculation. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\), and the relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \(|\psi\rangle\), and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Structure**: The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are generally non-Gaussian. For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state is a specific superposition of \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\).

2. **Normalization Constant**: Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) becomes:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 - e^{-2\alpha^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

3. **Expectation Values**:
   - The expectation value \(\langle a \rangle\) was calculated as:
     \[
     \langle a \rangle = \frac{\alpha e^{-2\alpha^2}}{1 - e^{-2\alpha^2}} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.6065}{0.3935} \approx 0.771.
     \]
   - The expectation value \(\langle a^2 \rangle\) was found to be \(\alpha^2 = 0.25\), identical to that of a coherent state.

4. **Variance**: The variance \(\text{Var}(a) = \langle a^2 \rangle - \langle a \rangle^2\) was computed as:
   \[
   \text{Var}(a) = 0.25 - (0.771)^2 \approx -0.344.
   \]
   A negative variance is unphysical, indicating a potential issue in the calculation or assumptions.

5. **Reference Gaussian State (\(\tau\))**: The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) was assumed to be a coherent state with the same \(\langle a \rangle\) as \(\rho\). For a coherent state, \(\langle a^2 \rangle = \langle a \rangle^2\), which conflicts with \(\langle a^2 \rangle = 0.25\) and \(\langle a \rangle^2 \approx 0.594\). This suggests that \(\tau\) cannot be a coherent state, and the initial assumption may be flawed.

6. **Non-Gaussianity Measure**: The relative entropy measure \(\text{del}_b\) compares the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) to the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). Since \(\rho\) is pure, \(\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = 0\). If \(\tau\) is a Gaussian state with the same moments as \(\rho\), \(\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau)\) would also be zero, leading to \(\text{del}_b = 0\). This implies that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the expectation that the superposition state is non-Gaussian.

7. **Conclusion**: The calculations suggest that the state \(|\psi\rangle\) has the same first and second moments as a coherent state, which is Gaussian. This implies that the non-Gaussianity is zero, even though the state is a superposition of coherent states. This result aligns with option D.

### Final Answer:
The non-Gaussianity of the state is **0**, as the state's moments match those of a Gaussian state.  
**Answer: D**
