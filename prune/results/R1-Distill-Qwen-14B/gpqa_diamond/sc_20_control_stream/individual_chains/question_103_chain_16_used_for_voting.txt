Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me draw its structure mentally. It's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The phenyl has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromo group and a nitro group.

So, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. If it's 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, that would mean the substituents are on the meta positions relative to each other. Let me think: numbering the ring, position 1 is where the phenyl is attached to the ketone. Then positions 2 and 4 are adjacent, and positions 3 and 5 are across. Wait, no, let me imagine the structure. The phenyl ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O). The substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point of attachment.

So, the substituents are at meta positions relative to each other? Because 3 and 5 are two positions apart from each other. Wait, 1 is the point of attachment, so 3 is two carbons away, and 5 is four away, but in a ring, 5 is actually across from 1, but I might be getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituents as in the meta position relative to each other. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at 5 and bromo at 3, which are adjacent to each other? Or perhaps they are on the same ring but in such a way that they are meta to each other.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact positions, but the main point is that the benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a bromo group, and it's attached to a ketone group.

Ok, so to make this compound from benzene, I need to introduce these substituents in the correct positions. The steps involve various reactions. Let's think about the possible reactions.

The starting material is benzene. The target has a ketone group, a nitro group, and a bromo group. So, benzene needs to undergo substitution reactions to add these groups.

I remember that acetyl groups can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. That uses CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst. So, Friedel-Crafts would add the acetyl group to benzene, making acetophenone. But where would it add? Friedel-Crafts is an electrophilic substitution that typically occurs at the para and ortho positions relative to the existing substituent. But wait, in this case, if we start with benzene, the first substitution would be the acetyl group. Then, further substituents would be added in the correct positions.

Wait, but wait, the target has substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So, perhaps the nitro and bromo groups are introduced after the ketone is already attached. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are introduced before the ketone.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down step by step.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which can be represented as:

O
||
C-Ph, where Ph is a benzene ring with Br at position 3 and nitro (NO2) at position 5.

So, the benzene ring must have substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group attached at position 1.

So, how to get these substituents in the right positions?

Let's think about the synthesis steps. We have to plan the order of adding substituents. Because each substitution can direct where the next groups go.

Benzene is a meta director when it's only attached to a substituent, but if there are multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on their positions and nature.

Wait, let me recall: activating groups are ortho/para directors, deactivating are meta directors. Nitro is a strong meta director. Bromine is ortho/para but deactivating because it's electron-withdrawing.

So, when introducing substituents, the order in which they are added can determine their positions.

But wait, the target has both nitro and bromo substituents on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. Let's see:

If I first introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts, then the ring becomes activated for substitution at ortho and para positions. Then, adding nitro and bromo groups.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, once the ring has the acetyl group, adding a nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. But wait, the acetyl is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating acyl group?), no wait, the acetyl is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Oh wait no, the acetyl group is an activating group for substitution in Friedel-Crafts, but it's a meta director. Wait, wait, no: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group, which is a strong meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So, after the acetyl, substituents would enter the meta position relative to it.

But in the target, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions, which are ortho and para to each other relative to the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and bromo groups are added first, but that seems unlikely because nitration is typically done before acylation if the acetylation is part of the synthesis.

Wait, let's consider each option.

Option A: The steps are CH3COCl/AlCl3; then Br2/FeBr3; then HNO3/H2SO4; then Fe/HCl; then HNO3/H2SO4; then NaNO2/HCl; then H3PO2.

Wait, that's a long sequence. Let's try to map this.

Starting with benzene:

i) CH3COCl and AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. So, benzene becomes acetophenone. The acetyl is at position 1 (assuming they're numbering from that point).

Then ii) Br2 with FeBr3: bromination. Since acetophenone is meta-directing, the bromine would enter meta relative to the acetyl group, so position 3.

So now, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3.

Then iii) HNO3 and H2SO4: nitration. Now, the directing group would be which? The acetyl is meta-directing, but the Br is ortho/para. Wait, but the ring now has two substituents: acetyl (strong meta) and Br (ortho/para, deactivating). So, the next nitration would be directed by the most influential group. Acetyl is a strong deactivating, meta director. So nitration would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. But where?

The current substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). So, the next nitro group would go into position 5 (meta to the acetyl). Because position 1 is the acetyl, so meta would be position 5. So that would place the nitro group at position 5.

So now, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's the target structure. But wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, yes, that's correct. So after steps i, ii, iii, you get the desired substituents.

But then step iv is Fe/HCl. That sounds like a reaction to remove something. Fe/HCl is often used to reduce nitro groups to amines, but wait, the nitro group is at position 5. So, if we reduce it, that would convert NO2 to NH2. But in the target, there's a nitro group, so this step would be a problem. Unless this is a step to do something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nitration step is not where I thought. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, after steps i, ii, iii: acetophenone (position 1), Br (position 3), nitro (position 5). So correct substituents.

But then step iv is Fe/HCl, which would presumably reduce the nitro group to an amine. But that would not lead to the target, which still has nitro. So this seems problematic.

Hmm. So perhaps option A isn't the right one. Let's check the other options.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, let's see. Starting with benzene.

i) Br2/FeBr3: bromination. Benzene becomes bromobenzene. The Br is a ortho/para director.

Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. The Br directs incoming groups to ortho and para. So nitration would add nitro at para to Br. So, in bromobenzene, nitration would place nitro at position 4? Or perhaps in another position.

Wait, in bromobenzene, the Br is at position 1. Nitration would occur at ortho (2) or para (4). The most probable position is para because nitration is a meta director for benzene, but wait, in bromobenzene, the Br is ortho/para directing. So nitration would occur at ortho or para to Br.

So, step ii: nitration adds NO2 either at 2 or 4. Let's say it's para, so position 4.

Now, the benzene ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4.

Then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para) and nitro (meta) groups.

Wait, the acylation is an electrophilic substitution. Which groups are directing now? The Br is deactivating but ortho/para directing. The nitro is a strong deactivating, meta directing. So, the most powerful director is the nitro group, which is meta. So, the acetyl would add at the meta position relative to nitro. Nitro is at 4, so meta would be position 1, but position 1 is already taken by Br. Hmm, that's a problem. Or wait, perhaps the acylation can't proceed because the ring is too deactivated. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, perhaps this step wouldn't work.

So, option B might not be feasible because adding the acetyl after nitro and bromine would be difficult. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; if the ring is deactivated by nitro, the acylation may not proceed.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, let's break it down.

Starting with benzene.

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Benzene becomes nitrobenzene, with NO2 at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduces nitrobenzene. Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent, but nitrobenzene is typically reduced to aniline with H2/Pd or something. Wait, maybe this is a typo, or perhaps in this context, Fe/HCl is for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the step is to convert nitro to amine? Let's see, nitrobenzene to benzene amine: but that would require much more vigorous conditions, like H2/Pd. So maybe this step isn't possible. So perhaps this option is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps step ii is a different reaction. Fe/HCl is sometimes used as a desulfurizing agent, but not for nitro groups. So maybe this step doesn't make sense. So C is probably not the right answer.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, let's go step by step.

i) Nitration: benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reducing. Nitrobenzene to aniline. But as before, I'm not sure if Fe/HCl can do that. Alternative, maybe the step is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Assuming that nitro is reduced to NH2, then step iii is NaNO2/HCl, which would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Then H3PO2 is used to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. Wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, but in this context, maybe it's for something else. Alternatively, I might be getting confused.

Wait, after step i: nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl. Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain. Let's think: perhaps nitro is reduced to amine, but I think that requires more than Fe/HCl. Alternatively, maybe this is a typo, and it's supposed to be H2/Pd or something else. But since this is an option, perhaps I should proceed as if it's possible.

So, assuming that step ii converts nitro to amine, benzene becomes aniline.

Then step iii: NaNO2 in HCl. That's diazotization. So, aniline becomes benzene diazonium chloride.

Then step iv: H3PO2. Hmm, H3PO2 is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts to phenols or for other transformations. Alternatively, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, perhaps used to form a benzyl group or something else. Wait, wait, if we have a diazonium salt and treat it with H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent), perhaps that would lead to substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the formation of phenol.

Wait, if we have benzene diazonium chloride and heat it with H3PO2, maybe it undergoes some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the Gattermann reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. So, if we have benzene diazonium chloride and then treat it with, say, water and H+, we get phenol. But then step iv would give phenol.

But then step v is Br2/FeBr3: bromination of phenol. But phenol is more reactive than benzene. So, adding Br2 in presence of FeBr3 would substitute the ring. Phenol is strongly activating, so the Br would enter ortho or para to the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but after step iv, assuming we have phenol, step v is bromination. So phenol (OH at position 1) would have Br entering ortho (2) or para (4). Then step vi is CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation. So acetyl would add to the ring, which is already substituted with OH and Br.

But I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me try to piece this together.

But perhaps I should evaluate each option again more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the acetyl group, then nitrate, then brominate, but ensuring that substituents are added in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the target has a ketone group, so Friedel-Crafts acylation must happen at some point. But after that, adding nitro and bromo groups in the correct positions.

So, let me think of the order. Let's first acetylate benzene to get acetophenone. Then, nitrate it. Since acetophenone is a meta director, the nitro group would go to the meta position (position 4 if the ketone is at 1). Then brominate. But wait, after nitration, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta) and nitro (meta to acetyl). So, when brominating, where would Br go?

Wait, after acetylation, nitration would add nitro at meta position relative to the ketone. So, position 4. Then, bromination would be directed by the nitro group and the acetyl group. Nitro is a meta director, acetyl is also a meta director. So, where would Br add?

If the ring has ketone at 1, nitro at 4, where would Br go? Let's see: the ring has substituents at 1 (keto) and 4 (nitro). The possible positions for Br would be where? The ketone is a meta director, so meta would be position 4 (already taken) and position 6. Nitro at 4 is a meta director, so meta would be positions 1 (taken) and 7, which is same as position 1 in a 6-membered ring.

This is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the order is to introduce nitro first, then acetyl, then bromine.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so after introducing nitro, acylation via Friedel-Crafts may not proceed because the ring is deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced after the acetyl group, which is activating.

Wait, but the acetyl is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive. So, perhaps the nitration can still occur, but it's more challenging.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 5 and the bromo at 3. So, perhaps the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromo at 3.

So, the order would be: acetylate, then nitrate (meta to acetyl, position 5), then brominate (position 3).

But wait, how does bromination come into play? After nitration, the ring has acetyl and nitro. Nitro is a meta director, acetyl is a meta director. So, when adding Br, the available positions would be, say, position 2,4,6, but depends on the directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is added before nitration. But then, after acetylation and bromination, nitration would be directed by both groups.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at Option A: The steps are i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration, iv) Fe/HCl, etc.

Wait, after acetylation and bromination, nitration would occur. So, in option A, after i and ii, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Then, nitration (step iii) would be directed by the acetyl group (since it's a stronger director?) or the Br group.

Wait, both acetyl and Br are deactivating. Acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. Which is more influential? The acetyl is more activating (since it's an acyl group) but wait, no, acetyl is a meta director and deactivating. So, the nitration would be directed by whichever group is more powerful.

In this case, after adding Br at 3, the ring has substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). So, when nitration happens, which group directs?

The acetyl is a meta director, so nitration would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl). The Br is at 3, which is ortho to position 4. So, the nitration would be influenced by both. But the acetyl is a stronger director because it's an acyl group, which is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So, the nitro would go to position 5.

So now, substituents are at 1 (keto), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which is exactly the target.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Why would that be done? It would likely reduce the nitro group. But in the target, the nitro group is present. So, this step seems contradictory. So, perhaps option A is not correct because after step iii, the nitration is done, but then step iv would remove the nitro group.

Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me check. The target has a nitro group. So, after steps i-iii, the ring has all three substituents, but wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which only has two substituents: Br and nitro. Wait, no, the ketone is at position 1, and substituents are at 3 and 5.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The target is a ketone attached to a benzene ring that has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, only three substituents: the ketone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, the steps should add exactly those.

But in option A, after steps i, ii, iii, we have all three substituents. So, but then step iv is Fe/HCl, which would reduce nitro to amine. So, that would change the structure, which is not desired. So, why is that step present?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let me re-examine option A.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Acetophenone is meta-directing, so Br adds at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Acetophenone is meta-directing, so nitro adds at position 5.

So after steps i-iii, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target. So why are there more steps beyond iii? Steps iv to vii.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the target is after step iii. Alternatively, maybe the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are for something else.

Wait, looking at the target, it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So, that's all. So, perhaps the steps after iii are to remove groups.

But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the subsequent steps are not part of the main synthesis but are extra steps. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation step in option A comes after some other steps. Let me think again.

Wait, in option A, the steps are:

i) acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) bromination → Br at 3.

iii) nitration → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) nitration again → add another nitro group.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So, that would not be correct because the target has only one nitro group. So, this seems wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where the nitro and bromo groups are added in the correct positions without any reduction steps that would eliminate nitro.

Looking again, perhaps option D is better.

Wait, option D's steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps hydrolysis to phenol.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Wait, let's see.

After i: nitrobenzene.

ii: Fe/HCl → aniline.

iii: NaNO2/HCl → benzene diazonium chloride.

iv: H3PO2 → perhaps hydrolysis to phenol. So, phenol.

v: Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol. Phenol is strong activating, so Br would add at ortho or para. Let's say para, position 4.

vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. The ring has Br at 4 and OH at 1. So, the acylation would be directed by the OH group (strong activating, ortho/para). But the acylation requires the ring to be activated. OH is activating, so acylation is possible.

So, acetophenone group would add at ortho or para to OH. If OH is at 1, then ortho is 2 and 6, para is 4. But position 4 is already taken by Br. So, acetylation would occur at position 2 or 6.

Wait, but in the target, the acetyl is at position 1. So, this approach isn't matching. So, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents.

The correct order should be:

1. Introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts. Because if you introduce a strong deactivating group first (like nitro), you cannot do Friedel-Crafts easily.

So, acetylate first.

Then, nitrate. Since acetyl is meta-directing, the nitro would go to position 5.

Then, brominate. Since the ring has acetyl (meta) and nitro (meta), which are both deactivating, but the nitro is a meta director. So, bromination would be directed by the acetyl, but perhaps it's possible.

Wait, the ring after acetylation and nitration would have substituents at 1 and 5. So, when brominating, the most activated positions would be ortho to the nitro group (which is a meta director) or meta to the acetyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine would be directed by the acetyl group, which is at position 1, so meta would be position 4. But in the target, it's at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the bromination happens before nitration.

Wait, so acetylation first (step i), then bromination (step ii). Acetyl is at 1, Br at 3.

Then, nitration (step iii). Now, acetyl is meta, Br is ortho/para. So, where would nitro go?

The ring has substituents at 1 (keto) and 3 (Br). The nitro would be directed by the acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). So, possible positions are 5 (meta to 1), which is para to Br, or 4 (ortho to Br, but that's adjacent to position 3). Hmm.

Wait, if the nitro is added at position 5 (meta to acetyl), that would fit the target.

So, the steps would be:

i) Acetylate → 1.

ii) Brominate → 3.

iii) Nitrate → 5.

Which is exactly what option A does in steps i, ii, iii.

But then why is there a step iv (Fe/HCl) in option A?

Oh, wait, in the target, the nitro group is present. So, if option A's steps go beyond iii, then those steps must be part of the synthesis but they can't introduce any changes that would remove the nitro group.

So, let's see:

After steps i, ii, iii: we have the correct substituents. Why are there more steps?

Option A's steps continue: iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because after step iii, you have the target structure. So, steps iv onward would modify it, which you don't want.

Hmm, but maybe I'm missing the point. Perhaps the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are not part of the main synthesis. But the question is about the entire sequence leading to the target, so perhaps the other steps are unnecessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the order.

Wait, maybe the nitration in step iii of option A is at a different position. Let me double-check.

After acetylation (step i), benzene is now acetophenone (keto at 1). Then step ii is bromination, which adds Br at 3 (meta to keto). Then step iii is nitration. The acetyl group is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5 (meta to 1, which is keto). So, the ring now has keto at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target. So, after step iii, it's done. So why are there more steps?

Perhaps the question is about a longer synthetic pathway that includes additional substituents, but then perhaps the target is formed earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in the options are presented as a sequence, but the desired product is formed in one of the steps, not necessarily the last. So, perhaps the correct option is the one where the target is formed in step iii, regardless of remaining steps. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, no. The question is about the entire sequence leading to the target. So, the entire sequence must produce the target without introducing any unwanted substituents.

But in option A, after step iii, the target is achieved. Steps iv onward would add more substituents or change existing ones, which would take the molecule away from the target.

So, perhaps the correct option is the one where the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are not part of the synthesis for the target. But that's not how the options are presented. Each option is a sequence that leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the target is achieved after step iii in option A. Maybe the target is achieved after a different step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of using a directing group. For example, using a methyl group as an activating group, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the acetyl group. But as I thought earlier, nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think of another possibility. The target has a nitro group and a bromo group, which are both meta to each other relative to the ketone. So, perhaps the synthesis could involve introducing the nitro group, then the acetyl group, and then the bromine. But that seems unlikely because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, but maybe the nitro group is introduced after the acetyl group. So, first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate.

Which is what option A does. So, after step iii, the target is achieved, but then why is there more steps?

Ah, perhaps the steps after iii are to deprotect or modify something else. But in the target molecule, there's no indication of any further steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is the one where the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are just extra and don't affect the structure. But that's not possible because each step is a reaction that changes the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point about the sequence.

Wait, another approach: the correct sequence must involve introducing the acetyl group, then nitro, then bromine. So, the nitro is added after the acetyl, which is correct because the acetyl is a meta director, so nitro is added at 5. Then bromine is added at 3.

But in option A, the bromine is added before nitration. So, the sequence is: acetyl, bromine, nitro.

Which would place nitro at 5, as desired.

But then, after step iii, the target is achieved. So, why are there more steps?

Maybe the problem is that all options include all steps, and I have to choose the one whose first three steps produce the target. But that doesn't make sense because the options are full sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is not achieved until a later step, but I'm not considering it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the step iv in option A is to do something else, not affecting the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps in step iv, Fe/HCl is used to remove the Br group, but that would require more specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are part of a more complex synthesis, but I'm not seeing the big picture.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct option is A, because after steps i, ii, iii, the target is formed, and the rest of the steps are extra. But the question says which sequence would lead to the target, implying that the entire sequence is necessary.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A adds the nitro group at the wrong position.

Wait, let's reevaluate the directing after steps i and ii in option A.

After step i: acetyl at 1.

Step ii: bromine at 3.

So, the substituents are at 1 and 3.

When nitrating, the acetyl is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5 (meta to 1). But the Br is at 3, which is adjacent to position 4. Since Br is an ortho/para director, but the ring is already deactivated by acetyl, perhaps the nitro goes to position 5.

So, after step iii, the substituents are at 1 (keto), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That's the target.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl: which would reduce the nitro group to an amine. But then the target would lose the nitro group, which is not desired. So, steps iv onward would ruin the target. So, option A's sequence cannot be correct because it would alter the nitro group.

But wait, if the target is formed only after step iii, why are the other steps present? That's confusing.

Alternative approach: perhaps the nitration in option A's step iii is not adding another nitro group but doing something else. Wait, but step iii is HNO3 and H2SO4, which are for nitration. So, it adds a nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let's re-examine option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So, aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to phenol. So, phenol.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol. Phenol is activating, so Br adds at ortho/para.

Assume Br adds at position 4.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. The ring now has phenol (OH at 1), Br at 4.

Acetylation requires an activating group. OH is activating, so acetophenone would be added at ortho or para to OH. OH is at 1, so ortho is positions 2 and 6, para is 4. But position 4 is already taken by Br. So, acetylation would occur at 2 or 6.

Assuming it's at position 2.

Then, step vii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has acetyl at 2, Br at 4, and OH at 1. So, where would nitro go? The acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para, OH is ortho/para. So, the most activating groups are OH and Br, which are deactivating but ortho/para directors. So, nitration would be directed by them. The available positions are 3,5,6. But this is getting complicated.

But the target has the ketone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, this doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is the one where the acetyl group is added last. Let's see.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 1.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → NO2 at 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

But after steps i and ii, the ring has Br at 1 and NO2 at 4. Now, acetylation would be directed by which group? The Br is ortho/para, but the NO2 is meta. So, acetylation would be directed by the more powerful group. Since NO2 is a strong deactivating, meta director, perhaps the acetyl would go meta to NO2, which is position 1 (already taken) or position 7 (same as 1). So, maybe acetylation doesn't occur, making option B not feasible.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Let's imagine the synthesis steps needed:

1. Make the benzene ring have the acetyl group. So, Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group meta to the acetyl.

3. Add bromo group meta to the acetyl, but where?

Alternatively, add the bromo group before nitration.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Acetylate.

- Brominate (meta to acetyl).

- Nitrate (meta to acetyl, so same as nitro at 5).

Wait, but then the bromo would be at 3 and nitro at 5. Which is correct.

So, the steps would be:

i) Acetylation.

ii) Bromination.

iii) Nitration.

Which aligns with option A's steps i, ii, iii.

But then, why does option A have steps iv to vii? Because the target is achieved after step iii, the other steps are not needed.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering all steps up to the target, but that's not the case. The options list all steps, so the correct sequence must produce the target in the last step.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken in thinking that the target is formed after step iii.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which requires the substituents to be at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, maybe the correct sequence involves first adding the ketone, then the nitro, then the bromo.

Wait, but how? Because if the ketone is at 1, nitro should be at 5, and bromo at 3. So, the order would be:

1. Acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Nitration → nitro at 5.

3. Bromination → bromo at 3.

Which is option A's steps i, ii, iii.

So, the target is achieved after step iii. But the rest of the steps in option A would alter the structure. So, perhaps the answer is option A, assuming that only the first three steps are needed, but the question includes the entire sequence, which may not matter as long as the target is formed at some point.

But that can't be, because the question is asking for the sequence that leads to the target. So, the sequence must go all the way to the target without altering it.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the effect of Fe/HCl. Maybe Fe/HCl isn't reducing the nitro group. What else could it do?

Fe/HCl is sometimes used to remove groups. For example, in the Bechamp reaction, or perhaps in the case of sulfonic acid groups. Alternatively, maybe it's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is not present after step iii. But that can't be because step iii is nitration.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where the nitro group is added after the bromine, and the acetyl is already present.

In that case, the substituents after steps i (acetyl), ii (bromine), iii (nitro) would be correct.

So, that's what option A does.

But why would option A have steps after iii?

Ah! Maybe I'm wrong about the effect of Fe/HCl. Perhaps it's not reducing the nitro group. Let me check:

Fe/HCl is a mixture of iron and hydrochloric acid. I think it's commonly used to remove the diazonium salt in the Sandmeyer reaction, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to remove a halogen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steps after iii in option A are part of a different pathway, but the target is already formed in step iii, so the subsequent steps are for another purpose. But that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct option is A, because the first three steps produce the target, and the rest of the steps are for something else, but the question is only about the sequence leading to the target. Since all options are sequences, perhaps the correct one is the one where the target is formed correctly.

So, in that case, the correct answer is option A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The sequence of reactions must introduce these substituents in the correct positions while considering the directing effects of the groups introduced at each step.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) occurs. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromine is added at position 3.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) occurs. The acetyl group remains the dominant director, and the nitro group is added at position 5.
   - At this point, the target molecule is formed after step iii.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, and H₃PO₂. These reactions are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and would alter the structure, making them incompatible with the desired product.

**Conclusion**: The target molecule is formed after step iii, but the inclusion of subsequent steps makes this option incorrect.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) introduces bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) occurs. Bromine is an ortho/para-director, so the nitro group is added at position 4.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group. However, the nitro group is a strong deactivator, making the ring less reactive toward electrophilic substitution. This step is unlikely to proceed successfully.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps are irrelevant as the acylation fails in step iii.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule due to the incompatibility of Friedel-Crafts acylation after nitration.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group. However, the amine group is a strong activating, ortho/para-director, which would direct the acetyl group to positions 2 or 6, not position 1. This step does not produce the ketone at position 1.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps are irrelevant as the acylation fails to place the ketone at position 1.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule due to the failure of Friedel-Crafts acylation to place the ketone at position 1.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: Hydrolysis (H₃PO₂) converts the diazonium salt to a phenol, introducing a hydroxyl group at position 1.
5. **Step v**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) occurs. The hydroxyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para-director, so bromine is added at position 4.
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group. The hydroxyl group directs the acetyl group to positions 2 or 6, not position 1. This step does not produce the ketone at position 1.
7. **Step vii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) is irrelevant as the ketone is not correctly positioned.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule due to the failure of Friedel-Crafts acylation to place the ketone at position 1.

---

### Final Answer:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as the target molecule is formed after step iii. However, the inclusion of unnecessary steps iv–vii makes this option problematic. Despite this, Option A is the only sequence where the target molecule is formed at any point in the sequence.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me draw its structure mentally. It's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The phenyl has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromo group and a nitro group.

So, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. If it's 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, that would mean the substituents are on the meta positions relative to each other. Let me think: numbering the ring, position 1 is where the phenyl is attached to the ketone. Then positions 2 and 4 are adjacent, and positions 3 and 5 are across. Wait, no, let me imagine the structure. The phenyl ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O). The substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point of attachment.

So, the substituents are at meta positions relative to each other? Because 3 and 5 are two positions apart from each other. Wait, 1 is the point of attachment, so 3 is two carbons away, and 5 is four away, but in a ring, 5 is actually across from 1, but I might be getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituents as in the meta position relative to each other. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at 5 and bromo at 3, which are adjacent to each other? Or perhaps they are on the same ring but in such a way that they are meta to each other.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact positions, but the main point is that the benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a bromo group, and it's attached to a ketone group.

Ok, so to make this compound from benzene, I need to introduce these substituents in the correct positions. The steps involve various reactions. Let's think about the possible reactions.

The starting material is benzene. The target has a ketone group, a nitro group, and a bromo group. So, benzene needs to undergo substitution reactions to add these groups.

I remember that acetyl groups can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. That uses CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst. So, Friedel-Crafts would add the acetyl group to benzene, making acetophenone. But where would it add? Friedel-Crafts is an electrophilic substitution that typically occurs at the para and ortho positions relative to the existing substituent. But wait, in this case, if we start with benzene, the first substitution would be the acetyl group. Then, further substituents would be added in the correct positions.

Wait, but wait, the target has substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So, perhaps the nitro and bromo groups are introduced after the ketone is already attached. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are introduced before the ketone.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down step by step.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which can be represented as:

O
||
C-Ph, where Ph is a benzene ring with Br at position 3 and nitro (NO2) at position 5.

So, the benzene ring must have substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group attached at position 1.

So, how to get these substituents in the right positions?

Let's think about the synthesis steps. We have to plan the order of adding substituents. Because each substitution can direct where the next groups go.

Benzene is a meta director when it's only attached to a substituent, but if there are multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on their positions and nature.

Wait, let me recall: activating groups are ortho/para directors, deactivating are meta directors. Nitro is a strong meta director. Bromine is ortho/para but deactivating because it's electron-withdrawing.

So, when introducing substituents, the order in which they are added can determine their positions.

But wait, the target has both nitro and bromo substituents on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. Let's see:

If I first introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts, then the ring becomes activated for substitution at ortho and para positions. Then, adding nitro and bromo groups.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, once the ring has the acetyl group, adding a nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. But wait, the acetyl is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating acyl group?), no wait, the acetyl is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Oh wait no, the acetyl group is an activating group for substitution in Friedel-Crafts, but it's a meta director. Wait, wait, no: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group, which is a strong meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So, after the acetyl, substituents would enter the meta position relative to it.

But in the target, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions, which are ortho and para to each other relative to the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and bromo groups are added first, but that seems unlikely because nitration is typically done before acylation if the acetylation is part of the synthesis.

Wait, let's consider each option.

Option A: The steps are CH3COCl/AlCl3; then Br2/FeBr3; then HNO3/H2SO4; then Fe/HCl; then HNO3/H2SO4; then NaNO2/HCl; then H3PO2.

Wait, that's a long sequence. Let's try to map this.

Starting with benzene:

i) CH3COCl and AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. So, benzene becomes acetophenone. The acetyl is at position 1 (assuming they're numbering from that point).

Then ii) Br2 with FeBr3: bromination. Since acetophenone is meta-directing, the bromine would enter meta relative to the acetyl group, so position 3.

So now, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3.

Then iii) HNO3 and H2SO4: nitration. Now, the directing group would be which? The acetyl is meta-directing, but the Br is ortho/para. Wait, but the ring now has two substituents: acetyl (strong meta) and Br (ortho/para, deactivating). So, the next nitration would be directed by the most influential group. Acetyl is a strong deactivating, meta director. So nitration would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. But where?

The current substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). So, the next nitro group would go into position 5 (meta to the acetyl). Because position 1 is the acetyl, so meta would be position 5. So that would place the nitro group at position 5.

So now, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's the target structure. But wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, yes, that's correct. So after steps i, ii, iii, you get the desired substituents.

But then step iv is Fe/HCl. That sounds like a reaction to remove something. Fe/HCl is often used to reduce nitro groups to amines, but wait, the nitro group is at position 5. So, if we reduce it, that would convert NO2 to NH2. But in the target, there's a nitro group, so this step would be a problem. Unless this is a step to do something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nitration step is not where I thought. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, after steps i, ii, iii: acetophenone (position 1), Br (position 3), nitro (position 5). So correct substituents.

But then step iv is Fe/HCl, which would presumably reduce the nitro group to an amine. But that would not lead to the target, which still has nitro. So this seems problematic.

Hmm. So perhaps option A isn't the right one. Let's check the other options.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, let's see. Starting with benzene.

i) Br2/FeBr3: bromination. Benzene becomes bromobenzene. The Br is a ortho/para director.

Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. The Br directs incoming groups to ortho and para. So nitration would add nitro at para to Br. So, in bromobenzene, nitration would place nitro at position 4? Or perhaps in another position.

Wait, in bromobenzene, the Br is at position 1. Nitration would occur at ortho (2) or para (4). The most probable position is para because nitration is a meta director for benzene, but wait, in bromobenzene, the Br is ortho/para directing. So nitration would occur at ortho or para to Br.

So, step ii: nitration adds NO2 either at 2 or 4. Let's say it's para, so position 4.

Now, the benzene ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4.

Then step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para) and nitro (meta) groups.

Wait, the acylation is an electrophilic substitution. Which groups are directing now? The Br is deactivating but ortho/para directing. The nitro is a strong deactivating, meta directing. So, the most powerful director is the nitro group, which is meta. So, the acetyl would add at the meta position relative to nitro. Nitro is at 4, so meta would be position 1, but position 1 is already taken by Br. Hmm, that's a problem. Or wait, perhaps the acylation can't proceed because the ring is too deactivated. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, perhaps this step wouldn't work.

So, option B might not be feasible because adding the acetyl after nitro and bromine would be difficult. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; if the ring is deactivated by nitro, the acylation may not proceed.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, let's break it down.

Starting with benzene.

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Benzene becomes nitrobenzene, with NO2 at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduces nitrobenzene. Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent, but nitrobenzene is typically reduced to aniline with H2/Pd or something. Wait, maybe this is a typo, or perhaps in this context, Fe/HCl is for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the step is to convert nitro to amine? Let's see, nitrobenzene to benzene amine: but that would require much more vigorous conditions, like H2/Pd. So maybe this step isn't possible. So perhaps this option is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps step ii is a different reaction. Fe/HCl is sometimes used as a desulfurizing agent, but not for nitro groups. So maybe this step doesn't make sense. So C is probably not the right answer.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, let's go step by step.

i) Nitration: benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reducing. Nitrobenzene to aniline. But as before, I'm not sure if Fe/HCl can do that. Alternative, maybe the step is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Assuming that nitro is reduced to NH2, then step iii is NaNO2/HCl, which would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Then H3PO2 is used to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. Wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, but in this context, maybe it's for something else. Alternatively, I might be getting confused.

Wait, after step i: nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl. Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain. Let's think: perhaps nitro is reduced to amine, but I think that requires more than Fe/HCl. Alternatively, maybe this is a typo, and it's supposed to be H2/Pd or something else. But since this is an option, perhaps I should proceed as if it's possible.

So, assuming that step ii converts nitro to amine, benzene becomes aniline.

Then step iii: NaNO2 in HCl. That's diazotization. So, aniline becomes benzene diazonium chloride.

Then step iv: H3PO2. Hmm, H3PO2 is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts to phenols or for other transformations. Alternatively, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, perhaps used to form a benzyl group or something else. Wait, wait, if we have a diazonium salt and treat it with H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent), perhaps that would lead to substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the formation of phenol.

Wait, if we have benzene diazonium chloride and heat it with H3PO2, maybe it undergoes some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the Gattermann reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. So, if we have benzene diazonium chloride and then treat it with, say, water and H+, we get phenol. But then step iv would give phenol.

But then step v is Br2/FeBr3: bromination of phenol. But phenol is more reactive than benzene. So, adding Br2 in presence of FeBr3 would substitute the ring. Phenol is strongly activating, so the Br would enter ortho or para to the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but after step iv, assuming we have phenol, step v is bromination. So phenol (OH at position 1) would have Br entering ortho (2) or para (4). Then step vi is CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation. So acetyl would add to the ring, which is already substituted with OH and Br.

But I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me try to piece this together.

But perhaps I should evaluate each option again more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the acetyl group, then nitrate, then brominate, but ensuring that substituents are added in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the target has a ketone group, so Friedel-Crafts acylation must happen at some point. But after that, adding nitro and bromo groups in the correct positions.

So, let me think of the order. Let's first acetylate benzene to get acetophenone. Then, nitrate it. Since acetophenone is a meta director, the nitro group would go to the meta position (position 4 if the ketone is at 1). Then brominate. But wait, after nitration, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta) and nitro (meta to acetyl). So, when brominating, where would Br go?

Wait, after acetylation, nitration would add nitro at meta position relative to the ketone. So, position 4. Then, bromination would be directed by the nitro group and the acetyl group. Nitro is a meta director, acetyl is also a meta director. So, where would Br add?

If the ring has ketone at 1, nitro at 4, where would Br go? Let's see: the ring has substituents at 1 (keto) and 4 (nitro). The possible positions for Br would be where? The ketone is a meta director, so meta would be position 4 (already taken) and position 6. Nitro at 4 is a meta director, so meta would be positions 1 (taken) and 7, which is same as position 1 in a 6-membered ring.

This is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the order is to introduce nitro first, then acetyl, then bromine.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so after introducing nitro, acylation via Friedel-Crafts may not proceed because the ring is deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced after the acetyl group, which is activating.

Wait, but the acetyl is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive. So, perhaps the nitration can still occur, but it's more challenging.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 5 and the bromo at 3. So, perhaps the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromo at 3.

So, the order would be: acetylate, then nitrate (meta to acetyl, position 5), then brominate (position 3).

But wait, how does bromination come into play? After nitration, the ring has acetyl and nitro. Nitro is a meta director, acetyl is a meta director. So, when adding Br, the available positions would be, say, position 2,4,6, but depends on the directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is added before nitration. But then, after acetylation and bromination, nitration would be directed by both groups.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at Option A: The steps are i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration, iv) Fe/HCl, etc.

Wait, after acetylation and bromination, nitration would occur. So, in option A, after i and ii, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Then, nitration (step iii) would be directed by the acetyl group (since it's a stronger director?) or the Br group.

Wait, both acetyl and Br are deactivating. Acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. Which is more influential? The acetyl is more activating (since it's an acyl group) but wait, no, acetyl is a meta director and deactivating. So, the nitration would be directed by whichever group is more powerful.

In this case, after adding Br at 3, the ring has substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). So, when nitration happens, which group directs?

The acetyl is a meta director, so nitration would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl). The Br is at 3, which is ortho to position 4. So, the nitration would be influenced by both. But the acetyl is a stronger director because it's an acyl group, which is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So, the nitro would go to position 5.

So now, substituents are at 1 (keto), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which is exactly the target.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Why would that be done? It would likely reduce the nitro group. But in the target, the nitro group is present. So, this step seems contradictory. So, perhaps option A is not correct because after step iii, the nitration is done, but then step iv would remove the nitro group.

Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me check. The target has a nitro group. So, after steps i-iii, the ring has all three substituents, but wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which only has two substituents: Br and nitro. Wait, no, the ketone is at position 1, and substituents are at 3 and 5.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The target is a ketone attached to a benzene ring that has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, only three substituents: the ketone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, the steps should add exactly those.

But in option A, after steps i, ii, iii, we have all three substituents. So, but then step iv is Fe/HCl, which would reduce nitro to amine. So, that would change the structure, which is not desired. So, why is that step present?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let me re-examine option A.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Acetophenone is meta-directing, so Br adds at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Acetophenone is meta-directing, so nitro adds at position 5.

So after steps i-iii, the ring has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target. So why are there more steps beyond iii? Steps iv to vii.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the target is after step iii. Alternatively, maybe the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are for something else.

Wait, looking at the target, it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So, that's all. So, perhaps the steps after iii are to remove groups.

But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the subsequent steps are not part of the main synthesis but are extra steps. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation step in option A comes after some other steps. Let me think again.

Wait, in option A, the steps are:

i) acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) bromination → Br at 3.

iii) nitration → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) nitration again → add another nitro group.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So, that would not be correct because the target has only one nitro group. So, this seems wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where the nitro and bromo groups are added in the correct positions without any reduction steps that would eliminate nitro.

Looking again, perhaps option D is better.

Wait, option D's steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps hydrolysis to phenol.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Wait, let's see.

After i: nitrobenzene.

ii: Fe/HCl → aniline.

iii: NaNO2/HCl → benzene diazonium chloride.

iv: H3PO2 → perhaps hydrolysis to phenol. So, phenol.

v: Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol. Phenol is strong activating, so Br would add at ortho or para. Let's say para, position 4.

vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. The ring has Br at 4 and OH at 1. So, the acylation would be directed by the OH group (strong activating, ortho/para). But the acylation requires the ring to be activated. OH is activating, so acylation is possible.

So, acetophenone group would add at ortho or para to OH. If OH is at 1, then ortho is 2 and 6, para is 4. But position 4 is already taken by Br. So, acetylation would occur at position 2 or 6.

Wait, but in the target, the acetyl is at position 1. So, this approach isn't matching. So, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents.

The correct order should be:

1. Introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts. Because if you introduce a strong deactivating group first (like nitro), you cannot do Friedel-Crafts easily.

So, acetylate first.

Then, nitrate. Since acetyl is meta-directing, the nitro would go to position 5.

Then, brominate. Since the ring has acetyl (meta) and nitro (meta), which are both deactivating, but the nitro is a meta director. So, bromination would be directed by the acetyl, but perhaps it's possible.

Wait, the ring after acetylation and nitration would have substituents at 1 and 5. So, when brominating, the most activated positions would be ortho to the nitro group (which is a meta director) or meta to the acetyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine would be directed by the acetyl group, which is at position 1, so meta would be position 4. But in the target, it's at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the bromination happens before nitration.

Wait, so acetylation first (step i), then bromination (step ii). Acetyl is at 1, Br at 3.

Then, nitration (step iii). Now, acetyl is meta, Br is ortho/para. So, where would nitro go?

The ring has substituents at 1 (keto) and 3 (Br). The nitro would be directed by the acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). So, possible positions are 5 (meta to 1), which is para to Br, or 4 (ortho to Br, but that's adjacent to position 3). Hmm.

Wait, if the nitro is added at position 5 (meta to acetyl), that would fit the target.

So, the steps would be:

i) Acetylate → 1.

ii) Brominate → 3.

iii) Nitrate → 5.

Which is exactly what option A does in steps i, ii, iii.

But then why is there a step iv (Fe/HCl) in option A?

Oh, wait, in the target, the nitro group is present. So, if option A's steps go beyond iii, then those steps must be part of the synthesis but they can't introduce any changes that would remove the nitro group.

So, let's see:

After steps i, ii, iii: we have the correct substituents. Why are there more steps?

Option A's steps continue: iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because after step iii, you have the target structure. So, steps iv onward would modify it, which you don't want.

Hmm, but maybe I'm missing the point. Perhaps the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are not part of the main synthesis. But the question is about the entire sequence leading to the target, so perhaps the other steps are unnecessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the order.

Wait, maybe the nitration in step iii of option A is at a different position. Let me double-check.

After acetylation (step i), benzene is now acetophenone (keto at 1). Then step ii is bromination, which adds Br at 3 (meta to keto). Then step iii is nitration. The acetyl group is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5 (meta to 1, which is keto). So, the ring now has keto at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target. So, after step iii, it's done. So why are there more steps?

Perhaps the question is about a longer synthetic pathway that includes additional substituents, but then perhaps the target is formed earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in the options are presented as a sequence, but the desired product is formed in one of the steps, not necessarily the last. So, perhaps the correct option is the one where the target is formed in step iii, regardless of remaining steps. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, no. The question is about the entire sequence leading to the target. So, the entire sequence must produce the target without introducing any unwanted substituents.

But in option A, after step iii, the target is achieved. Steps iv onward would add more substituents or change existing ones, which would take the molecule away from the target.

So, perhaps the correct option is the one where the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are not part of the synthesis for the target. But that's not how the options are presented. Each option is a sequence that leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the target is achieved after step iii in option A. Maybe the target is achieved after a different step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of using a directing group. For example, using a methyl group as an activating group, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the acetyl group. But as I thought earlier, nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think of another possibility. The target has a nitro group and a bromo group, which are both meta to each other relative to the ketone. So, perhaps the synthesis could involve introducing the nitro group, then the acetyl group, and then the bromine. But that seems unlikely because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, but maybe the nitro group is introduced after the acetyl group. So, first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate.

Which is what option A does. So, after step iii, the target is achieved, but then why is there more steps?

Ah, perhaps the steps after iii are to deprotect or modify something else. But in the target molecule, there's no indication of any further steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is the one where the target is formed in step iii, and the subsequent steps are just extra and don't affect the structure. But that's not possible because each step is a reaction that changes the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point about the sequence.

Wait, another approach: the correct sequence must involve introducing the acetyl group, then nitro, then bromine. So, the nitro is added after the acetyl, which is correct because the acetyl is a meta director, so nitro is added at 5. Then bromine is added at 3.

But in option A, the bromine is added before nitration. So, the sequence is: acetyl, bromine, nitro.

Which would place nitro at 5, as desired.

But then, after step iii, the target is achieved. So, why are there more steps?

Maybe the problem is that all options include all steps, and I have to choose the one whose first three steps produce the target. But that doesn't make sense because the options are full sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is not achieved until a later step, but I'm not considering it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the step iv in option A is to do something else, not affecting the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps in step iv, Fe/HCl is used to remove the Br group, but that would require more specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are part of a more complex synthesis, but I'm not seeing the big picture.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct option is A, because after steps i, ii, iii, the target is formed, and the rest of the steps are extra. But the question says which sequence would lead to the target, implying that the entire sequence is necessary.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A adds the nitro group at the wrong position.

Wait, let's reevaluate the directing after steps i and ii in option A.

After step i: acetyl at 1.

Step ii: bromine at 3.

So, the substituents are at 1 and 3.

When nitrating, the acetyl is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5 (meta to 1). But the Br is at 3, which is adjacent to position 4. Since Br is an ortho/para director, but the ring is already deactivated by acetyl, perhaps the nitro goes to position 5.

So, after step iii, the substituents are at 1 (keto), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That's the target.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl: which would reduce the nitro group to an amine. But then the target would lose the nitro group, which is not desired. So, steps iv onward would ruin the target. So, option A's sequence cannot be correct because it would alter the nitro group.

But wait, if the target is formed only after step iii, why are the other steps present? That's confusing.

Alternative approach: perhaps the nitration in option A's step iii is not adding another nitro group but doing something else. Wait, but step iii is HNO3 and H2SO4, which are for nitration. So, it adds a nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let's re-examine option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So, aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to phenol. So, phenol.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol. Phenol is activating, so Br adds at ortho/para.

Assume Br adds at position 4.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. The ring now has phenol (OH at 1), Br at 4.

Acetylation requires an activating group. OH is activating, so acetophenone would be added at ortho or para to OH. OH is at 1, so ortho is positions 2 and 6, para is 4. But position 4 is already taken by Br. So, acetylation would occur at 2 or 6.

Assuming it's at position 2.

Then, step vii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has acetyl at 2, Br at 4, and OH at 1. So, where would nitro go? The acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para, OH is ortho/para. So, the most activating groups are OH and Br, which are deactivating but ortho/para directors. So, nitration would be directed by them. The available positions are 3,5,6. But this is getting complicated.

But the target has the ketone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, this doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is the one where the acetyl group is added last. Let's see.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 1.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → NO2 at 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

But after steps i and ii, the ring has Br at 1 and NO2 at 4. Now, acetylation would be directed by which group? The Br is ortho/para, but the NO2 is meta. So, acetylation would be directed by the more powerful group. Since NO2 is a strong deactivating, meta director, perhaps the acetyl would go meta to NO2, which is position 1 (already taken) or position 7 (same as 1). So, maybe acetylation doesn't occur, making option B not feasible.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Let's imagine the synthesis steps needed:

1. Make the benzene ring have the acetyl group. So, Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group meta to the acetyl.

3. Add bromo group meta to the acetyl, but where?

Alternatively, add the bromo group before nitration.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Acetylate.

- Brominate (meta to acetyl).

- Nitrate (meta to acetyl, so same as nitro at 5).

Wait, but then the bromo would be at 3 and nitro at 5. Which is correct.

So, the steps would be:

i) Acetylation.

ii) Bromination.

iii) Nitration.

Which aligns with option A's steps i, ii, iii.

But then, why does option A have steps iv to vii? Because the target is achieved after step iii, the other steps are not needed.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering all steps up to the target, but that's not the case. The options list all steps, so the correct sequence must produce the target in the last step.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken in thinking that the target is formed after step iii.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which requires the substituents to be at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, maybe the correct sequence involves first adding the ketone, then the nitro, then the bromo.

Wait, but how? Because if the ketone is at 1, nitro should be at 5, and bromo at 3. So, the order would be:

1. Acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Nitration → nitro at 5.

3. Bromination → bromo at 3.

Which is option A's steps i, ii, iii.

So, the target is achieved after step iii. But the rest of the steps in option A would alter the structure. So, perhaps the answer is option A, assuming that only the first three steps are needed, but the question includes the entire sequence, which may not matter as long as the target is formed at some point.

But that can't be, because the question is asking for the sequence that leads to the target. So, the sequence must go all the way to the target without altering it.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the effect of Fe/HCl. Maybe Fe/HCl isn't reducing the nitro group. What else could it do?

Fe/HCl is sometimes used to remove groups. For example, in the Bechamp reaction, or perhaps in the case of sulfonic acid groups. Alternatively, maybe it's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is not present after step iii. But that can't be because step iii is nitration.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where the nitro group is added after the bromine, and the acetyl is already present.

In that case, the substituents after steps i (acetyl), ii (bromine), iii (nitro) would be correct.

So, that's what option A does.

But why would option A have steps after iii?

Ah! Maybe I'm wrong about the effect of Fe/HCl. Perhaps it's not reducing the nitro group. Let me check:

Fe/HCl is a mixture of iron and hydrochloric acid. I think it's commonly used to remove the diazonium salt in the Sandmeyer reaction, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to remove a halogen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steps after iii in option A are part of a different pathway, but the target is already formed in step iii, so the subsequent steps are for another purpose. But that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct option is A, because the first three steps produce the target, and the rest of the steps are for something else, but the question is only about the sequence leading to the target. Since all options are sequences, perhaps the correct one is the one where the target is formed correctly.

So, in that case, the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The sequence of reactions must introduce these substituents in the correct positions while considering the directing effects of the groups introduced at each step.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group at position 1, forming acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) occurs. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromine is added at position 3.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) occurs. The acetyl group remains the dominant director, and the nitro group is added at position 5.
   - At this point, the target molecule is formed after step iii.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, and H₃PO₂. These reactions are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and would alter the structure, making them incompatible with the desired product.

**Conclusion**: The target molecule is formed after step iii, but the inclusion of subsequent steps makes this option incorrect.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) introduces bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) occurs. Bromine is an ortho/para-director, so the nitro group is added at position 4.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group. However, the nitro group is a strong deactivator, making the ring less reactive toward electrophilic substitution. This step is unlikely to proceed successfully.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps are irrelevant as the acylation fails in step iii.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule due to the incompatibility of Friedel-Crafts acylation after nitration.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group. However, the amine group is a strong activating, ortho/para-director, which would direct the acetyl group to positions 2 or 6, not position 1. This step does not produce the ketone at position 1.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps are irrelevant as the acylation fails to place the ketone at position 1.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule due to the failure of Friedel-Crafts acylation to place the ketone at position 1.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) introduces the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: Hydrolysis (H₃PO₂) converts the diazonium salt to a phenol, introducing a hydroxyl group at position 1.
5. **Step v**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) occurs. The hydroxyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para-director, so bromine is added at position 4.
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group. The hydroxyl group directs the acetyl group to positions 2 or 6, not position 1. This step does not produce the ketone at position 1.
7. **Step vii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) is irrelevant as the ketone is not correctly positioned.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule due to the failure of Friedel-Crafts acylation to place the ketone at position 1.

---

### Final Answer:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as the target molecule is formed after step iii. However, the inclusion of unnecessary steps iv–vii makes this option problematic. Despite this, Option A is the only sequence where the target molecule is formed at any point in the sequence.

**Answer: A**
