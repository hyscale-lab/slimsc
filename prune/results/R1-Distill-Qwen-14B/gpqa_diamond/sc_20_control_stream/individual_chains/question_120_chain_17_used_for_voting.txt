Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant. So if I imagine a sphere with radius d, the number of stars inside it would be proportional to the volume. Since volume is (4/3)πd³, the number goes up with d cubed.

Wait, but parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a certain range of distances. Let me think about that. Plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So when plx increases, the distance decreases because the star is closer.

Now, I need to find the number of stars per unit plx. Let's say I have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distance range would be from d = 1/plx to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance. But wait, how do these relate? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = -d (dplx)^2? Wait, maybe I should express d in terms of plx.

Let me think again. If plx increases by dplx, then the distance decreases by dd. Let's see, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = (-1/(plx)^2) dplx. So, dplx = - (plx)^2 * dd.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the volume between two spherical shells. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell is proportional to 4πd² dd multiplied by the star density, which I'll call n. So number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd.

But I want this number in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So substituting, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So the shell in plx space is from plx to plx + dplx, but in d space, it's from d to d - something. Hmm, perhaps I can write the number in terms of plx.

The volume in terms of d is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = ( - d^2 ) dplx, because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting into the volume:

4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ) ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the number of stars is positive, so maybe I should take the absolute value when considering the range. So the number N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) ) dplx? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me think again. For a thin shell at distance d, the volume is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd is N = n * 4πd² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Substituting, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, so that's N = -4πn (1/plx^4) dplx. The negative sign suggests that as plx increases, d decreases, so the number doesn't become negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value of dd, so the number becomes positive.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the number of stars per unit plx. So, the number per unit plx would be dN/dplx. Let's compute that.

We have N = n * 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting,

dN = n *4π d² dd = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx = -4πn (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the change in N is negative when plx increases, but we can take the absolute value for the number of stars. So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is 4πn (1/plx^4). Wait, but wait—no, because dN is proportional to dplx. So to get the number per unit plx, we divide dN by dplx, which gives dN/dplx = 4πn (1/plx^4). So that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let's think about this. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. So number of stars in a shell is N = n * 4πd² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting,

N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx).

But since we're considering the range of plx, the number of stars would be positive when plx decreases and d increases. So perhaps I should express it as N = n *4π (1/plx^4) d (plxd), where d is the distance corresponding to plx.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the range of plx. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the same as the number of stars at distances d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx and dd = (1/(plx + dplx)) ) - d. Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way.

Alternatively, the number of stars per unit volume is n (constant). The volume between distance d and d + dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars is N = n * 4πd² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d =1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

Putting it together, N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

Which is N = -4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

But since dplx is a positive quantity (the range), taking the absolute value, N = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., dN/dplx) would be 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So the number would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options: option A is 1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d², because the volume element is 4πd² dd. But when we convert this to plx, it's (1/plx^4) as I found. So the number per unit plx (i.e., per dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So that would suggest the answer is option A.

But wait, in another approach, maybe the confusion is about the distribution. If the number of stars per unit volume is constant, then the number density is n.

So, the number of stars in a volume V is N = n V.

If the parallax is plx = 1/d, and we consider a thin shell in plx space, say from plx to plx + dplx, which corresponds to a shell in d from 1/plx to 1/(plx +dplx).

The volume of that shell is approximately 4π (1/(plx))^2 * ( (1/(plx +dplx)) - 1/plx )^{-1}.

Wait, no, the shell's volume is the difference between two spheres: V = (4/3)π (d_outer)^3 - (4/3)π (d_inner)^3.

But for small dplx, this can be approximated as the derivative. Alternatively, if I take a thin shell, the volume is 4π d^2 dd.

But since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 dplx ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Taking the absolute value, the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this volume is N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is 4π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Expressing the volume in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume of the shell becomes:

\[
4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Taking the absolute value for the number of stars, the number of stars in the shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx},
\]

where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars. To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)), we divide \( N \) by \( d\text{plx} \), giving:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the options provided:
- **A)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \) matches the derived result.
- **B)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) is incorrect, as it does not account for the correct scaling with parallax.
- **C)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \) is incorrect, as it underestimates the dependence on parallax.
- **D)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \) is incorrect, as it overestimates the dependence on parallax.

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
