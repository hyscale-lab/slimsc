Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an alien astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are whether they die before getting there, or if it takes 72, 77, or 81 years.

Wait, so the astronaut's own experienced time is what matters here. That's the proper time, right? Because when you're moving at such high speeds, time dilation comes into play. So the time measured by the astronaut will be less than the time measured by someone on Earth. Or wait, no, actually, it depends on whose frame of reference we're considering.

Let me recall the time dilation formula. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured by the Earth observer (the stationary frame), and t' is the time measured by the astronaut (the moving frame). Alternatively, I think another way to write it is t' = t * gamma inverse, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' = t / gamma. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, let me think. The moving clock runs slower, so for the moving observer, the Earth clock is ticking slower. Or wait, no, from the perspective of the astronaut, Earth time would be dilated. So the time experienced by the astronaut is less than what Earth observers would say.

Wait, but the question is asking from the astronaut's perspective. So the proper time is their own time.

Wait, but let's think about the problem. The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 light-years, right? Wait, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me confirm that. Oh wait, actually, I'm not sure. Let me not get stuck on that. The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. So the distance is D, and the speed is v, so the time from Earth's frame would be t = D / v. But since the astronaut's time is affected by time dilation, we have to compute their experienced time.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh, wait, perhaps the distance is not needed because the astronaut's own lifetime is given. Wait, the average lifetime is around 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22. Hmm, but that's a red herring maybe. Wait, no, because the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, not whether they live long enough.

Wait, no, the first option is about dying before reaching Earth, so perhaps we do need to compare the trip time with the astronaut's lifespan. So the astronaut's experienced age will increase by the trip time. If trip time is longer than 150 -22=128 years, they might not survive. Wait, but let's see.

But first, let's figure out the trip time from the astronaut's perspective.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for time experienced by the traveler, which is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the Earth time.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get the formula right. So the time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is given by t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth frame. Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' = t / gamma.

But wait, gamma is greater than 1 when v is a significant fraction of c. So if gamma is, say, 200, then t' would be t divided by 200. So the trip time for the astronaut is much shorter than what Earth observers see.

But wait, the question is about the distance. Oh, right, because without knowing the distance, we can't compute t. Wait, but perhaps we have to assume that the distance is such that at v = 0.99999987c, the time t from Earth's perspective is something manageable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, the problem says it's the Large Magellanic Cloud, so let's use a distance of D. Let me think about the Earth's frame of reference. So from Earth, the distance is D, and the spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So the time taken t_earth = D / v.

But what is D? Let me look up the approximate distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth. I think it's about 160,000 light-years. So D ≈ 160,000 ly.

So t_earth = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c). Since ly is light-years and v is in terms of c, the time t_earth would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 years. Let's compute that.

Wait, 160,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * (1 / ~0.99999987) which is roughly 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 is about 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) = 160,000 + 20.8 ≈ 160,020.8 years.

Wait, so from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 160,020 years. But wait, the astronaut's experienced time would be much less because of time dilation.

So the proper time t’ is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute v as a fraction of c. v = 0.99999987 c. So (v/c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that.

0.99999987 squared is approximately: since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x, but 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me compute more accurately. 0.99999987 squared. Let me compute it step by step.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So that's approximately 1 - 2.6e-7, which is 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute that. The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Wait, wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2, since (1e-3.5) is about 3.16e-4, but wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2? Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2? Let me think: 1e-3 is 0.001, so 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 1e-7 is 0.0000001. So sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is approximately 3.16e-4.

But sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.11e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.11e-4.

So t’ = t_earth * 5.11e-4 = 160,020.8 years * 5.11e-4 ≈ let's compute that.

160,020.8 * 5.11e-4 = 160,020.8 * 0.000511 ≈

Compute 160,020.8 * 0.0005 = 80.0104

And 160,020.8 * 0.000011 = approximately 1.76023

So adding them, 80.0104 + 1.76023 ≈ 81.77 years.

Wait, so from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 81.77 years. So when they leave, they're 22, so upon reaching Earth, they'd be 22 + 81.77 ≈ 103.77 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they might survive. So the answer would be about 81 years, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because maybe I made a mistake in the sqrt step.

Wait another approach: Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for v=0.99999987c,

1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

As before, (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974, so 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Thus, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051 (since 0.0005 is 5e-4, and 5.1e-4 squared is about 2.6e-7).

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

So t_earth is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / ~1 ≈ 160,000 years.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, v is 0.99999987c. So t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years, since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so t_earth ≈ (160,000 / ~1) years ≈ 160,000 years.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is t’ = t_earth / gamma.

Wait, because t’ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

So t’ = (160,000 years) * (sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years.

So yes, that's about 81.6 years. So looking at the options, option C is 81 years.

But wait, the distance I used was 160,000 light-years. Is that correct?

Wait, I think the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. But perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the problem might have provided the necessary data. Wait, the problem doesn’t give the distance, so maybe I made a wrong assumption here.

Wait, the problem statement says the Large Magellanic Cloud as the starting point, but it doesn't give the distance. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute the time based on the speed given, without the actual distance. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the distance is approximately the same as the Andromeda galaxy, which is about 2.5 million light-years away. But no, that's way too far. Wait, but the problem says 'engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at 0.99999987c'. So the distance must be such that the trip time is manageable.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the given data without the actual distance.

Wait, but the problem gives the astronaut's age and the average lifetime. Let me re-examine the problem.

The astronaut is 22 years old. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years. So from Earth's perspective, the trip takes t_earth = D / v. But from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes t’ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

If t’ is less than 150 -22 = 128 years, they'd survive. If it's more, they wouldn't.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, t’ is about 81 years. So 81 < 128, so they survive. So the answer would be 81 years, which is option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using the Lorentz transformation. Because when you're moving at such a high speed, the distance in your frame is contracted. So the proper length (distance in Earth's frame) is L = D. The length in the astronaut's frame is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time experienced t’ is L’ / v = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Which is the same as t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D/(v) * sqrt(...) = t_earth * sqrt(...), which is the same as before.

So perhaps I'm on the right track.

Wait, but without the actual distance D, perhaps the question expects me to compute using the given speed and the time it takes, considering that the distance is such that the Earth is reached in the astronaut's lifetime.

Wait, but the problem gives the speed as 0.99999987c, which is so close to c that the time from Earth's perspective is about D/(0.99999987c) ≈ D/c in years, since 0.99999987 ~ 1.

But without D, maybe the problem is more about the calculation using the speed and the time experienced.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to find that the trip time is so long that the astronaut would die before reaching Earth, but our calculation says about 81 years, which would make the astronaut 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150, so they'd survive. So option A is incorrect.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the gamma factor. Let me compute gamma again more accurately.

v = 0.99999987c

So beta = v/c = 0.99999987

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

Compute beta^2: (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute it.

0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

The last term is (1.3e-7)^2 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.5.

So t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / ~1 = 160,000 years.

t’ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.58 years.

So approximately 81.58 years, which rounds to 81 years. So option C is correct.

Therefore, the astronaut would experience about 81 years, so they will not die before reaching Earth. So the correct answer is C.

To determine how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective, we use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. The astronaut is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is approximately \( D \approx 160,000 \) light-years. The time dilation formula is:

\[
t' = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( t \) is the time measured in the Earth frame, and \( t' \) is the proper time experienced by the astronaut. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

From the Earth's perspective, the time taken for the trip is:

\[
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,020.8 \, \text{years}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \). Squaring \( v/c = 0.99999987 \), we get:

\[
\left(0.99999987\right)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026,
\]

and:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.00051.
\]

The proper time experienced by the astronaut is then:

\[
t' = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,020.8 \cdot 0.00051 \approx 81.77 \, \text{years}.
\]

This means the astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the trip. Since the astronaut is initially 22 years old and the average lifetime of their species is 150 years, they will survive the journey.

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** The astronaut will die before reaching Earth: Incorrect, as the trip time is only 81 years, and the astronaut will live well beyond this.
- **B)** 72 years: Incorrect, as the calculation shows the trip time is closer to 81 years.
- **C)** 81 years: Correct, as shown by the time dilation calculation.
- **D)** 77 years: Incorrect, as it underestimates the trip time.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an alien astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are whether they die before getting there, or if it takes 72, 77, or 81 years.

Wait, so the astronaut's own experienced time is what matters here. That's the proper time, right? Because when you're moving at such high speeds, time dilation comes into play. So the time measured by the astronaut will be less than the time measured by someone on Earth. Or wait, no, actually, it depends on whose frame of reference we're considering.

Let me recall the time dilation formula. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured by the Earth observer (the stationary frame), and t' is the time measured by the astronaut (the moving frame). Alternatively, I think another way to write it is t' = t * gamma inverse, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' = t / gamma. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, let me think. The moving clock runs slower, so for the moving observer, the Earth clock is ticking slower. Or wait, no, from the perspective of the astronaut, Earth time would be dilated. So the time experienced by the astronaut is less than what Earth observers would say.

Wait, but the question is asking from the astronaut's perspective. So the proper time is their own time.

Wait, but let's think about the problem. The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 light-years, right? Wait, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me confirm that. Oh wait, actually, I'm not sure. Let me not get stuck on that. The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. So the distance is D, and the speed is v, so the time from Earth's frame would be t = D / v. But since the astronaut's time is affected by time dilation, we have to compute their experienced time.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh, wait, perhaps the distance is not needed because the astronaut's own lifetime is given. Wait, the average lifetime is around 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22. Hmm, but that's a red herring maybe. Wait, no, because the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, not whether they live long enough.

Wait, no, the first option is about dying before reaching Earth, so perhaps we do need to compare the trip time with the astronaut's lifespan. So the astronaut's experienced age will increase by the trip time. If trip time is longer than 150 -22=128 years, they might not survive. Wait, but let's see.

But first, let's figure out the trip time from the astronaut's perspective.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for time experienced by the traveler, which is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the Earth time.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get the formula right. So the time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is given by t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth frame. Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' = t / gamma.

But wait, gamma is greater than 1 when v is a significant fraction of c. So if gamma is, say, 200, then t' would be t divided by 200. So the trip time for the astronaut is much shorter than what Earth observers see.

But wait, the question is about the distance. Oh, right, because without knowing the distance, we can't compute t. Wait, but perhaps we have to assume that the distance is such that at v = 0.99999987c, the time t from Earth's perspective is something manageable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, the problem says it's the Large Magellanic Cloud, so let's use a distance of D. Let me think about the Earth's frame of reference. So from Earth, the distance is D, and the spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So the time taken t_earth = D / v.

But what is D? Let me look up the approximate distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth. I think it's about 160,000 light-years. So D ≈ 160,000 ly.

So t_earth = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c). Since ly is light-years and v is in terms of c, the time t_earth would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 years. Let's compute that.

Wait, 160,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * (1 / ~0.99999987) which is roughly 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 is about 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) = 160,000 + 20.8 ≈ 160,020.8 years.

Wait, so from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 160,020 years. But wait, the astronaut's experienced time would be much less because of time dilation.

So the proper time t’ is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute v as a fraction of c. v = 0.99999987 c. So (v/c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that.

0.99999987 squared is approximately: since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x, but 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me compute more accurately. 0.99999987 squared. Let me compute it step by step.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So that's approximately 1 - 2.6e-7, which is 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute that. The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Wait, wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2, since (1e-3.5) is about 3.16e-4, but wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2? Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2? Let me think: 1e-3 is 0.001, so 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 1e-7 is 0.0000001. So sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is approximately 3.16e-4.

But sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.11e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.11e-4.

So t’ = t_earth * 5.11e-4 = 160,020.8 years * 5.11e-4 ≈ let's compute that.

160,020.8 * 5.11e-4 = 160,020.8 * 0.000511 ≈

Compute 160,020.8 * 0.0005 = 80.0104

And 160,020.8 * 0.000011 = approximately 1.76023

So adding them, 80.0104 + 1.76023 ≈ 81.77 years.

Wait, so from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 81.77 years. So when they leave, they're 22, so upon reaching Earth, they'd be 22 + 81.77 ≈ 103.77 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they might survive. So the answer would be about 81 years, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because maybe I made a mistake in the sqrt step.

Wait another approach: Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for v=0.99999987c,

1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

As before, (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974, so 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Thus, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051 (since 0.0005 is 5e-4, and 5.1e-4 squared is about 2.6e-7).

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

So t_earth is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / ~1 ≈ 160,000 years.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, v is 0.99999987c. So t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years, since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so t_earth ≈ (160,000 / ~1) years ≈ 160,000 years.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is t’ = t_earth / gamma.

Wait, because t’ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

So t’ = (160,000 years) * (sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years.

So yes, that's about 81.6 years. So looking at the options, option C is 81 years.

But wait, the distance I used was 160,000 light-years. Is that correct?

Wait, I think the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. But perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the problem might have provided the necessary data. Wait, the problem doesn’t give the distance, so maybe I made a wrong assumption here.

Wait, the problem statement says the Large Magellanic Cloud as the starting point, but it doesn't give the distance. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute the time based on the speed given, without the actual distance. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the distance is approximately the same as the Andromeda galaxy, which is about 2.5 million light-years away. But no, that's way too far. Wait, but the problem says 'engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at 0.99999987c'. So the distance must be such that the trip time is manageable.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the given data without the actual distance.

Wait, but the problem gives the astronaut's age and the average lifetime. Let me re-examine the problem.

The astronaut is 22 years old. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years. So from Earth's perspective, the trip takes t_earth = D / v. But from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes t’ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

If t’ is less than 150 -22 = 128 years, they'd survive. If it's more, they wouldn't.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, t’ is about 81 years. So 81 < 128, so they survive. So the answer would be 81 years, which is option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using the Lorentz transformation. Because when you're moving at such a high speed, the distance in your frame is contracted. So the proper length (distance in Earth's frame) is L = D. The length in the astronaut's frame is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time experienced t’ is L’ / v = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Which is the same as t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D/(v) * sqrt(...) = t_earth * sqrt(...), which is the same as before.

So perhaps I'm on the right track.

Wait, but without the actual distance D, perhaps the question expects me to compute using the given speed and the time it takes, considering that the distance is such that the Earth is reached in the astronaut's lifetime.

Wait, but the problem gives the speed as 0.99999987c, which is so close to c that the time from Earth's perspective is about D/(0.99999987c) ≈ D/c in years, since 0.99999987 ~ 1.

But without D, maybe the problem is more about the calculation using the speed and the time experienced.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to find that the trip time is so long that the astronaut would die before reaching Earth, but our calculation says about 81 years, which would make the astronaut 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150, so they'd survive. So option A is incorrect.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the gamma factor. Let me compute gamma again more accurately.

v = 0.99999987c

So beta = v/c = 0.99999987

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

Compute beta^2: (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute it.

0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

The last term is (1.3e-7)^2 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.5.

So t_earth = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / ~1 = 160,000 years.

t’ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.58 years.

So approximately 81.58 years, which rounds to 81 years. So option C is correct.

Therefore, the astronaut would experience about 81 years, so they will not die before reaching Earth. So the correct answer is C.


To determine how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective, we use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. The astronaut is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is approximately \( D \approx 160,000 \) light-years. The time dilation formula is:

\[
t' = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( t \) is the time measured in the Earth frame, and \( t' \) is the proper time experienced by the astronaut. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

From the Earth's perspective, the time taken for the trip is:

\[
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,020.8 \, \text{years}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \). Squaring \( v/c = 0.99999987 \), we get:

\[
\left(0.99999987\right)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026,
\]

and:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.00051.
\]

The proper time experienced by the astronaut is then:

\[
t' = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,020.8 \cdot 0.00051 \approx 81.77 \, \text{years}.
\]

This means the astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the trip. Since the astronaut is initially 22 years old and the average lifetime of their species is 150 years, they will survive the journey.

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** The astronaut will die before reaching Earth: Incorrect, as the trip time is only 81 years, and the astronaut will live well beyond this.
- **B)** 72 years: Incorrect, as the calculation shows the trip time is closer to 81 years.
- **C)** 81 years: Correct, as shown by the time dilation calculation.
- **D)** 77 years: Incorrect, as it underestimates the trip time.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
