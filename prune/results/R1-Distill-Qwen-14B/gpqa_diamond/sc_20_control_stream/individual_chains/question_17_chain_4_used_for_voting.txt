Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, the question is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M for the complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, which probably means we don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA or anything like that. 

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA complexes? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formula is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. The formation constant, K, is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−. 

The problem gives me the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. So, I think I can use the formation constant to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. 

Wait, the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, that means the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− were equal, right? Because one mole of Ca²+ reacts with one mole of EDTA⁴− to form one mole of CaEDTA²−.

But wait, in this case, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− would be zero because all the ions have formed the complex. No, wait, that's not right. Because EDTA is a chelating agent, but unless it's in excess, some free ions should remain. Oh, but the problem says it's stochiometric. Stochiometric means the molar amounts are exactly in the ratio required for the reaction. So, if we have 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, that implies that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− were each 0.02 M because 1:1 ratio. But wait, that can't be right because when they form the complex, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− would drop, and the complex forms. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the equilibrium.

Let me define some variables. Let’s say the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Then the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− → CaEDTA²−.

The formation constant K is 5e10. So,

K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]) = 5x10^10.

Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, which I think means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− are equal because they started at the same concentration and form a 1:1 complex. So, let me denote [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴−] = x.

Then, substituting into the K equation,

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Wait, no, because [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So, the denominator is x squared, and the numerator is 0.02. So,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Hmm, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

Taking square root: x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5= approx 3.16e-7. So, 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, 6.3e-7 is one of the options. Looking back at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me recheck my steps because sometimes stoichiometric conditions can be a point of confusion. So, if the solution is stochiometric, that means that the molar amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− were equal initially, and all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA. Wait, no, that's not the case because if they are in excess, but here the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. So perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are each 0.02 M, and they form 0.02 M complex. But wait, that would imply that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are converted into the complex, which isn't possible because the formation constant is high, so some would remain.

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. If it's stochiometric, the moles of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal, but not necessarily all form the complex. So, let me think again. Let the initial concentrations be [Ca²+] = c, [EDTA⁴−] = c, and the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, no, the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So, the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− are x each. So, the initial concentrations before complex formation would have been c + x for both, but that's probably complicating. Alternatively, perhaps the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA are x each. So the total EDTA is x, because all the EDTA is either in the complex or free. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as the complex dissociating:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−.

The K for dissociation is 1/K_form, which is 2e-11. Because K_form is 5e10, so K_dissoc = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation equilibrium is:

K_dissoc = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] / [CaEDTA²−] = 2e-11.

Given that [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, and assuming [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴−] = x (since stoichiometric, same for both), then:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 M. Wait, 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7 M. So that's the same result as before. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M. Which matches option C.

So yeah, the answer is C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the solution is stochiometric, the concentrations of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions are equal, denoted as \(x\). The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Then, substituting into the K equation,

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Wait, no, because [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So, the denominator is x squared, and the numerator is 0.02. So,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Hmm, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

Taking square root: x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5= approx 3.16e-7. So, 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, 6.3e-7 is one of the options. Looking back at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me recheck my steps because sometimes stoichiometric conditions can be a point of confusion. So, if the solution is stochiometric, that means that the molar amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− were equal initially, and all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA. Wait, no, that's not the case because if they are in excess, but here the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution.

But wait, that would imply that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are converted into the complex, which isn't possible because the formation constant is high, so some would remain.

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. If it's stochiometric, the moles of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal, but not necessarily all form the complex. So, let me think again. Let the initial concentrations be [Ca²+] = c, [EDTA⁴−] = c, and the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, no, the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So, the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− are x each. So, the initial concentrations before complex formation would have been c + x for both, but that's probably complicating. Alternatively, perhaps the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA are x each. So the total EDTA is x, because all the EDTA is either in the complex or free. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as the complex dissociating:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−.

The K for dissociation is 1/K_form, which is 2e-11. Because K_form is 5e10, so K_dissoc = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation equilibrium is:

K_dissoc = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] / [CaEDTA²−] = 2e-11.

Given that [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, and assuming [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴−] = x (since stoichiometric, same for both), then:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 M. Wait, 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7 M. So that's the same result as before. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M. Which matches option C.

So yeah, the answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[

\]

Given that the solution is stochiometric, the concentrations of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions are equal, denoted as \(x\). The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
