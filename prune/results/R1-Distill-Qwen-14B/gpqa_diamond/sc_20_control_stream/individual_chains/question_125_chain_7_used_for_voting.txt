Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Consider a quantum mechanical system with a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². This potential corresponds to a force obeying Hooke's law, which I remember is a spring force, so this is like a 3D harmonic oscillator.

The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) possible for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. So I need to figure out the energy levels and their degeneracies for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

Wait, what's the structure of the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator? I think in 1D, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is the principal quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). But in 3D, it's a bit different because it's not just one direction but three: x, y, z.

Oh wait, in 3D, the energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or sometimes written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Since each direction contributes to the total energy.

But wait, sometimes it's written in terms of the total quantum number or something else. Oh, maybe n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers for each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. And each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer (0,1,2, ...).

So the energy levels are equally spaced, but the degeneracy (number of states with the same energy) increases as n increases.

But wait, the problem is about the third excited state. What does that mean? Hmm, I think the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is the first state. The first excited state is the next one, then the second, third, etc. So the third excited state would be the fourth level in order.

Wait, ground state is n=0 (so n_x + n_y + n_z =0 → all zero), which is E_0 = (0 + 3/2) ħω. Then the first excited state is when n=1, which would have energy (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is n=2 → E= (2 + 3/2) ħω = (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3 → (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω.

So the energy should be (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, options A and C have (9/2) ħω as energy.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) have the same energy eigenvalue, i.e., the degeneracy for that energy level.

In 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for each energy level E_n is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, wait wait no, that's not right. Alternatively, for a given n, the number of possible states is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z.

The number of such combinations is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n. The formula for this is (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait no, wait, I think it's (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, the number would be (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, let me double-check. For n=0, (0 +2 choose 2) =1 → correct, only one state. For n=1, (3 choose 2)=3 → which makes sense because the three possibilities are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). For n=2, (4 choose 2)=6. Let me see: the possible states are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 states. So yes, the formula holds.

So for the third excited state (n=3), the number is (5 choose 2)=10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω with 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says the same energy but 3 states. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, let me make sure that third excited state is at n=3. Ground state is n=0 → first. First excited is n=1 → second. Second excited n=2 → third. Third excited is n=3 → fourth. So yes, n=3.

So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. That matches option A.

In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \), and the energy levels are quantized as \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions.

The degeneracy of each energy level, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, is determined by the number of ways to distribute \( n \) quanta among the three dimensions. This is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

For the third excited state, the quantum number \( n \) is 3 (since the ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second to \( n = 2 \), and the third to \( n = 3 \)). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the degeneracy formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

The energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

From the given options, the correct choice is the one with energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and degeneracy 10.
