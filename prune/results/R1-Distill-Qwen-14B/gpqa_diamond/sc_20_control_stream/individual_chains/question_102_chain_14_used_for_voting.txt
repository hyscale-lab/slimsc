Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down and see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to understand why a particular experiment didn't show the expected green signal when visualized under a confocal microscope.

First, let's parse the setup of the experiment. The researchers created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so in this case, two ORFs (ligand and receptor) are in the same vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', followed by eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is behind an IRES element.

Wait, I remember that IRES elements are internal ribosome entry sites. They allow for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA without needing a new ribosome initiation. So in this setup, the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand, and the IRES probably drives the expression of the receptor from the same mRNA.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. I think these stop cassettes are used with Cre to control expression. LoxP sites are recognized by Cre recombinase, which deletes the region between them. So if Cre is present, the stop cassette would be removed, allowing expression of the downstream genes.

So the construct is designed so that when Cre is expressed, the stop cassettes are removed. For the ligand, this would allow mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand. For the receptor, eGFP would be expressed.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the ligand and receptor are on the same mRNA. The CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES drives the receptor. So without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the downstream fluorescent proteins from being expressed. When Cre is present, the stops are removed, so mCherry and eGFP should be expressed along with the ligand and receptor, respectively.

The researchers then made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre should be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, meaning it's active in neural crest cells, which is where the ligand and receptor are initially expressed.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see a green signal, which would come from eGFP expression. But they didn't see any green. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the issue here is about expression of the receptor-eGFP. Even if they're paracrine, if the construct isn't expressed, you won't see the GFP. So I don't think this explains the lack of green.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If eGFP isn't properly trafficked, it wouldn't fluoresce. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in a Western blot. Oh wait, the Western blot result was that the total proteins gave a signal proportional to actin loading. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe it implies that the proteins were expressed and detected, but perhaps not correctly localized. If the GFP is stuck in the Golgi, it might not be on the cell surface, so fluorescence wouldn't be seen. But in Western, they'd see the protein, but maybe not the GFP? Or perhaps the GFP is functional but not visible due to localization. Hmm.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Oh, but the construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand. I think CBA is a strong promoter, so it doesn't necessarily require enhancers. Also, if the enhancer were missing, both the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed, which would affect both fluorescent proteins. But the Western blot might have detected the proteins, though.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor and eGFP are out of frame, leading to a frameshift and possibly a nonfunctional or truncated protein. Alternatively, the eGFP ORF might not be correctly in frame, so it's not translated. So in this case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that the receptor is behind the IRES. IRES elements are usually in the same frame as the initial ORF. Or do they allow for a second ORF in a separate frame? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. IRES typically allows for translation of the second ORF without being dependent on the first, but whether they're in the same frame? I think IRES can allow for a different reading frame because the ribosome can reinitiate, but I'm not entirely sure.

In this case, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP, but between them is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the stop cassette blocks the receptor and eGFP. When Cre is active, the stop is removed, so the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then when Cre is active, the stop is removed, so the receptor's ORF is expressed, and then the eGFP. But if the IRES is upstream of the receptor, perhaps the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed, and the eGFP is in a separate ORF.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is in frame with the receptor. If it's not in frame, then the removal of the stop would lead to a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't correctly expressed.

But wait the question says that the researchers used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them on Western blot. So they probably saw the ligand and receptor proteins on the blot. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed. But the issue is that the eGFP isn't showing up in the fluorescence.

So the Western blot probably showed the receptor protein, but the eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, no. Because the eGFP is downstream of the receptor. When the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed together.

Wait, perhaps when Cre is active, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is removed, allowing the receptor ORF to be expressed, and the eGFP to be expressed as well. So the eGFP should be expressed in the same cells as the receptor.

But in the experiment, when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, Cre is expressed in neural crest derivatives, so the eGFP should be expressed there. But they don't see any green.

Hmm. So why would the eGFP not be expressed? Let's think about the vector construction.

The vector is a bicistronic loxP-Cre construct. The ligand is first, then a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is after an IRES, then a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, the way it's written: the ligand's ORF is 5', fused to mCherry. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop cassette (loxP). So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with eGFP after a stop cassette (lox2272). So when Cre is active, the stop is removed, allowing receptor and eGFP expression.

But perhaps the problem is in the reading frame. The ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So the first ORF is the ligand, and the IRES allows for the second ORF (receptor) to be translated.

Wait, but the second stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre removes that stop, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed as a single ORF? Or as separate? Because if the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, then when the stop is removed, the translation would read through the receptor ORF into the eGFP, but if they are not in the same frame, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

Wait, that could be the issue. If the stop cassette (lox2272) is between receptor and eGFP, perhaps when it's removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed correctly. So the construct might have the receptor and eGFP in the same ORF, but not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is translated, and then the IRES or another mechanism allows eGFP to be expressed. But if the IRES is only for the receptor, then the eGFP would require its own promoter or IRES.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

The vector is a bicistronic vector, so it's one transcript. The first part is ligand under CBA promoter, then the IRES, then the receptor. Then, after the receptor, there's a stop cassette (lox2272), and then eGFP.

Wait, no. The way it's described: between the ligand and mCherry is a stop cassette. So ligand is 5', then a stop, then mCherry. But the receptor is at 3', so the vector is ligand -> stop -> mCherry, and then I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the vector is ligand and receptor on the same transcript, but with the stop cassettes controlling expression of the fluorescent proteins.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot showed that both the ligand and receptor were expressed, but the eGFP wasn't. So why wouldn't the eGFP be expressed?

If the eGFP is out of frame, then when the stop is removed, the translation might read through the receptor into eGFP but in a different frame, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP production.

So in that case, the eGFP isn't properly expressed, so no fluorescence. That would explain why the green signal isn't observed.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly translated, so no fluorescent protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct's eGFP is not properly cloned. But that's more about cloning errors, which is a possibility, but the question is about the experimental setup.

So putting it all together, the most likely reason is that the eGFP is out of frame with the receptor, so when the stop is removed, it doesn't get translated correctly. Therefore, no eGFP is expressed, leading to no green signal.

So the answer should be D.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to co-express a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) fused downstream of each. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is behind an IRES element. Stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) are used to regulate the expression of the fluorescent proteins. When Cre is present, these stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed alongside the ligand and receptor, respectively.

The experiment was performed by crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. However, no green signal from eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy. The Western blot confirmed the expression of the ligand and receptor proteins, but the lack of fluorescence suggests an issue with eGFP expression.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This does not explain the lack of green signal. The issue is with eGFP expression, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If eGFP were mislocalized, it might not fluoresce, but the Western blot would still detect the receptor protein. The question does not provide evidence of mislocalization, making this less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong promoter that does not necessarily require enhancers. Additionally, the Western blot confirmed the expression of the ligand and receptor, so this is unlikely to be the issue.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The stop cassette (lox2272) between the receptor and eGFP is removed by Cre, allowing their expression. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the removal of the stop cassette would result in a frameshift, preventing proper translation of eGFP. This would explain the lack of fluorescence while still allowing the receptor to be detected on the Western blot.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, leading to a frameshift and failure to express eGFP correctly.
