Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the key here is understanding how the ratio of atoms in two energy levels changes with temperature. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. Oh, wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So the effective temperature without spots is higher (6000 K) and with spots it's lower (5500 K). 

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let me clarify: when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So normally (without spots), the ratio is higher. So we're supposed to find the factor by which the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. I'm not sure if that's relevant here, but maybe the energy difference can be calculated from the wavelength. Let me think about that.

Energy levels are related to the transition's wavelength via E = hc/λ. So maybe I can compute the energy difference (E2 - E1) using this wavelength. Or perhaps I can use the relation between the two temperatures and the ratio of the populations.

Wait, the ratio without spots (R1) compared to with spots (R2) is R1/R2 = some factor. So I need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. Wait, no, wait. The ratio observed is n_level1 / n_level2. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So normally (no spots) the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2. So when the temperature is higher, what happens to this ratio? Let me think about the Boltzmann equation. 

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So if the temperature increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio n2/n1 increase. So n1/n2 would decrease. 

Wait, so higher T leads to more population in higher energy levels. So when the temperature is higher, n2 is larger relative to n1, so n1/n2 is smaller. Conversely, when temperature is lower, n1 would be more dominant, making n1/n2 larger.

Wait no, wait, let me get this straight. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. Therefore, n1/n2 would decrease. So when the star has spots, its Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K. So with spots, T is lower, which would mean that n1/n2 is higher than when T is higher. 

But the question states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, that can't be right according to my earlier logic. Because if T is lower, n1/n2 should be higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the levels mixed up. Let me clarify. Let's say level 1 is lower energy than level 2. So E2 > E1. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). As T increases, this ratio increases, so n2/n1 is higher when T is higher. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes more positive, so n1/n2 increases? Wait, no. Because (n1/n2) is 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, let me rephrase: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for a higher T, exp term is larger (since denominator is larger), so n2/n1 increases. So n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1), so it decreases.

So when the star has spots, T goes down to 5500 K. So without spots, T is 6000 K. So at 6000 K, n2/n1 is higher. So n1/n2 is lower. Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, the ratio is lower, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I got the levels reversed. Suppose level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. Wait no, that can't be. Because the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. Let me think about the energy difference being E = hc/λ. So the higher the energy (the smaller the wavelength), the higher the transition. So if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, and the wavelength is 1448 Å, then E2 > E1.

So with that in mind, when T goes up, n2/n1 increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So without spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T is lower (with spots, T=5500 K). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That's conflicting with what I just thought.

Wait, the problem says that the observed ratio decreases when spots are present. So when T drops to 5500 K, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. But according to my logic, lower T should lead to a higher (n1/n2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the reciprocal ratio. Let me check the problem statement again. It says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't. Wait, that would mean that without spots, the ratio is higher. But according to my earlier analysis, higher T leads to lower (n1/n2). So without spots, T is higher, leading to lower (n1/n2). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which would mean n1/n2 is lower with spots. So higher T (without spots) leads to lower (n1/n2), which aligns with the observation.

Wait, so without spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio is higher. But the problem says it decreases. So perhaps I'm mixing up which ratio is which. Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is n_level2/n_level1, not n1/n2. Let me read the question again.

The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels: level 1 and level 2. So when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So ratio = n1/n2. So when T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). So higher T would lead to higher n1/n2? No, wait, because at higher T, the exponent (ΔE/(kT)) is smaller, so the exp term is larger. Because ΔE is positive, so as T increases, ΔE/(kT) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases.

Wait, let me think about the numbers. Suppose E2 is higher than E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = positive. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(...) increases. So n2/n1 increases. Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease as T increases. 

So without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, T is 5500 K. So without spots, n1/n2 is lower than with spots. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That would mean that without spots, the ratio is higher. But according to the calculation, without spots (higher T), the ratio is lower. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, unless I've made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, I think the confusion is here: when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is higher. But the problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the ratio being discussed is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Wait, let me read the question again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower. But according to our analysis, higher T leads to lower n1/n2. So without spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T is 5500 K (with spots). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower, which would only be possible if the ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is talking about n2/n1. Let me think again. Let’s say R = n2/n1. Then R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So higher T makes R bigger, lower T makes R smaller.

So when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K. So R decreases (because lower T makes R smaller). That matches the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Ah, okay, I think I see my confusion. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. But according to our analysis, when T is lower, n2/n1 (R) would decrease. So if the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing, that would imply that R is increasing. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this mathematically. Let me define:

R = (n1)/(n2)

At T1 = 6000 K (no spots), R1 = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1))

At T2 = 5500 K (spots), R2 = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2))

The factor we're looking for is R1/R2.

So factor = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so factor = exp( ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because ΔE is E2 - E1, which is positive.

So factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(6000) - 1/(5500)) )

But wait, 1/T1 is 1/6000, and 1/T2 is 1/5500. Since T2 < T1, 1/T2 > 1/T1. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is negative. So factor is exp(-something).

So the factor is less than 1. That means R1 is less than R2. So without spots, R is lower than when spots are present. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the reciprocal ratio. Let me think again.

Suppose the ratio being observed is n2/n1.

Then R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T))

So R1 (no spots) at T=6000K, R2 (spots) at T=5500K.

The factor would be R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because (1/5500 - 1/6000) is positive. So exponent is positive, so factor is greater than 1. So R1/R2 > 1.

If the observed ratio is n2/n1, then when the star has spots (R2), the ratio is lower than R1 (no spots). Which matches the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So now, the factor we're looking for is R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

We can compute this.

But we need to find ΔE. We can calculate it from the wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by λ=1448e-10 m:

E = 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 

1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

But to get this in terms of eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high, but let's go with it.

So ΔE = 8.57 eV.

Now, in terms of k (Boltzmann constant), which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So the exponent becomes:

(ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

First, compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500*6000) ) = (500)/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K.

So (ΔE /k ) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 100,000.

Let me calculate that more accurately.

8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 100,000 (since 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617). 

So 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ (8.57 * 1e5 ) / 0.8617 ≈ 857000 / 0.8617 ≈ let's compute 857000 / 0.8617.

Hmm, 0.8617 * 1e6 is about 861700, so 857000 is a bit less than that. Let me compute 857000 ÷ 0.8617.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 8.57 / 0.00008617.

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 / 8.617 ) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 0.994) * 1e5 ≈ ~99,400.

So (ΔE/k)= ~99,400 K.

Then, multiply by (1/5500 -1/6000 )= 1.515e-5 1/K.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )= 99,400 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 

99,400 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99,400 * 0.00001515 ≈ 

Let me compute 99,400 * 1.515e-5.

= 99400 * 1.515e-5 = 99400 * 1.515 * 1e-5.

99400 *1e-5 is 0.994.

0.994 * 1.515 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

Compute e^1.505: e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. 1.505 is a little more than 1.5.

Let me compute e^1.505.

Using Taylor series or calculator approximation.

Alternatively, e^1.505 ≈ e^(1.5) * e^(0.005) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00501 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.005) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0224 ≈ 4.504.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze how the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \), changes with temperature. The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. When the star does not have spots, \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when it has spots, \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The problem states that the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases when the star has spots, meaning \( n_1/n_2 \) is higher at \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \) than at \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \).

To find the factor by which the ratio changes, we compute:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is calculated from the wavelength of the transition, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant in eV/K is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right).
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \cdot 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.505.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.505) \approx \frac{1}{\exp(1.505)}.
\]

Using \( \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5 \), we find:

\[
\text{Factor} \approx \frac{1}{4.5} \approx 0.222.
\]

This means the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) to \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Comparing the options, the closest match is:

**C) ~4.5**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the key here is understanding how the ratio of atoms in two energy levels changes with temperature. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. Oh, wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So the effective temperature without spots is higher (6000 K) and with spots it's lower (5500 K). 

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let me clarify: when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So normally (without spots), the ratio is higher. So we're supposed to find the factor by which the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. I'm not sure if that's relevant here, but maybe the energy difference can be calculated from the wavelength. Let me think about that.

Energy levels are related to the transition's wavelength via E = hc/λ. So maybe I can compute the energy difference (E2 - E1) using this wavelength. Or perhaps I can use the relation between the two temperatures and the ratio of the populations.

Wait, the ratio without spots (R1) compared to with spots (R2) is R1/R2 = some factor. So I need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. Wait, no, wait. The ratio observed is n_level1 / n_level2. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So normally (no spots) the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2. So when the temperature is higher, what happens to this ratio? Let me think about the Boltzmann equation. 

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So if the temperature increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio n2/n1 increase. So n1/n2 would decrease. 

Wait, so higher T leads to more population in higher energy levels. So when the temperature is higher, n2 is larger relative to n1, so n1/n2 is smaller. Conversely, when temperature is lower, n1 would be more dominant, making n1/n2 larger.

Wait no, wait, let me get this straight. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. Therefore, n1/n2 would decrease. So when the star has spots, its Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K. So with spots, T is lower, which would mean that n1/n2 is higher than when T is higher. 

But the question states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, that can't be right according to my earlier logic. Because if T is lower, n1/n2 should be higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the levels mixed up. Let me clarify. Let's say level 1 is lower energy than level 2. So E2 > E1. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). As T increases, this ratio increases, so n2/n1 is higher when T is higher. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes more positive, so n1/n2 increases? Wait, no. Because (n1/n2) is 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, let me rephrase: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for a higher T, exp term is larger (since denominator is larger), so n2/n1 increases. So n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1), so it decreases.

So when the star has spots, T goes down to 5500 K. So without spots, T is 6000 K. So at 6000 K, n2/n1 is higher. So n1/n2 is lower. Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, the ratio is lower, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I got the levels reversed. Suppose level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. Wait no, that can't be. Because the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. Let me think about the energy difference being E = hc/λ. So the higher the energy (the smaller the wavelength), the higher the transition. So if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, and the wavelength is 1448 Å, then E2 > E1.

So with that in mind, when T goes up, n2/n1 increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So without spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T is lower (with spots, T=5500 K). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That's conflicting with what I just thought.

Wait, so without spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio is higher. But the problem says it decreases. So perhaps I'm mixing up which ratio is which. Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is n_level2/n_level1, not n1/n2. Let me read the question again.

The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels: level 1 and level 2. So when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So ratio = n1/n2. So when T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). So higher T would lead to higher n1/n2? No, wait, because at higher T, the exponent (ΔE/(kT)) is smaller, so the exp term is larger. Because ΔE is positive, so as T increases, ΔE/(kT) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases.

Wait, let me think about the numbers. Suppose E2 is higher than E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = positive. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(...) increases. So n2/n1 increases. Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease as T increases. 

So without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, T is 5500 K. So without spots, n1/n2 is lower than with spots. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That would mean that without spots, the ratio is higher. But according to the calculation, without spots (higher T), the ratio is lower. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, unless I've made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, I think the confusion is here: when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is higher. But the problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the ratio being discussed is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Wait, let me read the question again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower. But according to our analysis, higher T leads to lower n1/n2. So without spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T is 5500 K (with spots). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower, which would only be possible if the ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is talking about n2/n1. Let me think again. Let’s say R = n2/n1. Then R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So higher T makes R bigger, lower T makes R smaller.

So when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K. So R decreases (because lower T makes R smaller). That matches the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Ah, okay, I think I see my confusion. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. But according to our analysis, when T is lower, n2/n1 (R) would decrease. So if the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing, that would imply that R is increasing. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this mathematically. Let me define:

R = (n1)/(n2)

At T1 = 6000 K (no spots), R1 = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1))

At T2 = 5500 K (spots), R2 = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2))

The factor we're looking for is R1/R2.

So factor = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so factor = exp( ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because ΔE is E2 - E1, which is positive.

So factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(6000) - 1/(5500)) )

But wait, 1/T1 is 1/6000, and 1/T2 is 1/5500. Since T2 < T1, 1/T2 > 1/T1. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is negative. So factor is exp(-something).

So the factor is less than 1. That means R1 is less than R2. So without spots, R is lower than when spots are present. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the reciprocal ratio. Let me think again.

Suppose the ratio being observed is n2/n1.

Then R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T))

So R1 (no spots) at T=6000K, R2 (spots) at T=5500K.

The factor would be R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because (1/5500 - 1/6000) is positive. So exponent is positive, so factor is greater than 1. So R1/R2 > 1.

If the observed ratio is n2/n1, then when the star has spots (R2), the ratio is lower than R1 (no spots). Which matches the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So now, the factor we're looking for is R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

We can compute this.

But we need to find ΔE. We can calculate it from the wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by λ=1448e-10 m:

E = 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 

1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

But to get this in terms of eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high, but let's go with it.

So ΔE = 8.57 eV.

Now, in terms of k (Boltzmann constant), which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So the exponent becomes:

(ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

First, compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500*6000) ) = (500)/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K.

So (ΔE /k ) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 100,000.

Let me calculate that more accurately.

8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 100,000 (since 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617). 

So 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ (8.57 * 1e5 ) / 0.8617 ≈ 857000 / 0.8617 ≈ let's compute 857000 / 0.8617.

Hmm, 0.8617 * 1e6 is about 861700, so 857000 is a bit less than that. Let me compute 857000 ÷ 0.8617.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 8.57 / 0.00008617.

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 / 8.617 ) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 0.994) * 1e5 ≈ ~99,400.

So (ΔE/k)= ~99,400 K.

Then, multiply by (1/5500 -1/6000 )= 1.515e-5 1/K.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )= 99,400 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 

99,400 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99,400 * 0.00001515 ≈ 

Let me compute 99,400 * 1.515e-5.

= 99400 * 1.515e-5 = 99400 * 1.515 * 1e-5.

99400 *1e-5 is 0.994.

0.994 * 1.515 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

Compute e^1.505: e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. 1.505 is a little more than 1.5.

Let me compute e^1.505.

Using Taylor series or calculator approximation.

Alternatively, e^1.505 ≈ e^(1.5) * e^(0.005) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00501 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.005) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0224 ≈ 4.504.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze how the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \), changes with temperature. The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. When the star does not have spots, \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when it has spots, \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The problem states that the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases when the star has spots, meaning \( n_1/n_2 \) is higher at \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \) than at \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \).

To find the factor by which the ratio changes, we compute:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is calculated from the wavelength of the transition, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant in eV/K is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right).
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \cdot 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.505.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.505) \approx \frac{1}{\exp(1.505)}.
\]

Using \( \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5 \), we find:

\[
\text{Factor} \approx \frac{1}{4.5} \approx 0.222.
\]

This means the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) to \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Comparing the options, the closest match is:
