Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are given, and we have to figure out which one is correct based on the IR and NMR data provided.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can predict the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. 

The 3400–2500 region is typically where O-H or N-H stretches appear. The broadness suggests it's an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. But carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, so maybe that's a stretch. Wait, but 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm.

The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be C=C aromatic ring stretches. So that suggests there's an aromatic group in the molecule.

Now onto the NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum has several signals:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. The broadness is typical for an acidic proton like that.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are probably aromatic protons. The doublets suggest that the aromatic ring has substituents in a para position. Like two substituents opposite each other. So maybe a para-substituted benzene, where each substituent is causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Looking at the integration, each of these is 2H, so two sets of two equivalent protons each. So, the substituents are in the para position. For example, maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent at the para position and another group that doesn't affect the aromatic protons as much. Or maybe it's just one substituent causing these doublets.

Wait, another thought: if the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions, like two groups attached to positions 1 and 3? No, wait, para is 1 and 4. So if a substituent is at position 4 and another at 1, that's para. Or maybe a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the aromatic ring has two substituents that are not adjacent, but that's not making sense. Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So each of these is a doublet, integrating to 2H each. That's the pattern of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if you have substituents in positions 1 and 4 (para), then the two protons adjacent to substituent 1 would be one pair, and the two adjacent to substituent 4 would be another pair, each as doublets. So the splitting is because of the substituents on the ring.

So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. Let's say substituent A is in position 1 and substituent B is in position 4. But wait, that's not possible because para would mean same position? Oh, wait, para is 1 and 4, so substituents in those positions would be across from each other.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and another substituent at position 1? Or perhaps just one substituent at position 4, which would cause the adjacent protons to split into two doublets. Wait, maybe it's a single substituent in the para position, say a group like -COOH or something else.

Wait, but the aromatic protons are in two doublets of 2H each. So maybe the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has two substituents that are identical in the para positions. No, that's not making sense because that would make the ring more symmetrical.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which causes the aromatic protons to shift. For example, if we have a substituent at position 4, which is a carbonyl group, such as a carboxylic acid. So in that case, the ring would have a para-substituted group, perhaps a -COOH.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet of 1H. That's likely the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. So that fits with a para-substituted benzoic acid. So the structure could be p-substituted benzoic acid. But wait, benzoic acid has the structure C6H5COOH, but that's just a substituent in position 1. But in this case, the aromatic ring may have another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets of 2H each. So perhaps the substituent is in the para position, so the ring has two substituents in the para positions? Or maybe just one substituent, but with a branching that makes the ring have two sets of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the group is a carbonyl or something else, making the ring have two sets of H's each as doublets.

Let me think of the integration of the aromatic protons: 2H each. So perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and the ring has two substituents which are symmetric. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group at position 4, and another substituent, say, an ethyl group at position 1. But then the ring would have two substituents in the para positions, leading to the aromatic protons being split into two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2... wait, no, maybe it's a substituent with branching. Let me think of the other NMR signals.

Looking at the rest of the NMR data:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, likely a CH group adjacent to something, maybe a CH2 or another CH group. Maybe part of an isopropyl group or a sec-butyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two H's, perhaps a CH2 group next to a branching point, like a CH2 connected to a CH and a CH2CH3.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for three H's. That's probably a CH3 group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, no, a doublet for CH3 usually indicates that it's attached to a CH group which is connected to another group. Like in an isopropyl group, the CH3 is attached to a CH which is attached to another group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three H's, which is typical of a CH2CH3 group attached to something. So a methyl group at the end of a chain, like in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a group that has a branched chain. Let's think of the substituent as a -COO-R group, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone or ester, but earlier I thought it might be a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the IR also shows a broad peak around 3400–2500 cm-1, which is more indicative of an O-H stretch, possibly from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 peak could be a carbonyl from an ester or perhaps a ketone. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. So maybe this is an ester? Because esters have carbonyls around 1720–1740 cm-1, which fits. But then why is there a broad peak in IR around 3400–2500? Maybe it's an alcohol, but the options don't include any alcohols. Wait, the options are all various substituted benzenes, some with carboxylic acids or ester groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's 3400-2500 is an O-H stretch, but not from an acid. Maybe an alcohol? But then why the 1720 cm-1? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an O-H group, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 1H. That's definitely an -OH proton. So that makes sense for a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad O-H stretch in IR and a broad singlet in NMR.

So, the IR at 1720 cm-1 might be a carbonyl, which in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1, but maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR at 1720 would be a bit high, but it's possible.

Wait, but let's think of the structure. If the aromatic ring has a para-substituted group, which is a carboxylic acid, then the structure would be something like para-ethoxybenzoic acid? No, that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, looking at the NMR again, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's a typical pattern for a para-substituted benzene with electron-withdrawing groups. For example, a -NO2 group, or a -COOH group. Let me see: in benzoic acid, the ring protons are deshielded, so the ortho and para protons would be more downfield. But the substituent in para position would cause the adjacent (ortho) protons to be upfield or downfield? Wait, for a -COOH group in para, the protons adjacent (ortho) would be deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta would be upfield.

Wait, but in para-substituted benzoic acid, the two ortho protons (to the COOH) would be equivalent, and the two meta would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets. Let's say the substituent is at position 4. Then, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho, and 3 and 5 would be meta. Wait, no, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent (ortho) to substituent 1, which is COOH. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is at position 4, which is the para position of substituent 1. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 1, and the aromatic protons are in positions 2 and 6 (ortho) and 3 and 5 (meta). But for para-substituted benzoic acid, the ortho protons would be more deshielded than the meta, so their chemical shifts would be higher. So in the NMR, the two ortho protons (from COOH) would be at higher ppm than the meta protons.

In this problem, the two doublets are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So maybe the substituent is a -COOH group at position 4. Then, the two ortho protons (positions 3 and 5) would be more downfield, and the two meta protons (positions 2 and 6) would be less downfield. Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is another group, like an ester or a ketone.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone. For example, a benzophenone derivative. But then why would there be an -OH peak in the NMR? That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Another approach: looking at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to something, like a CH2CH(CH3)2 or similar. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a branching point. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is then attached to another group. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but attached to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The group attached to the benzene ring must have a chain that leads to a carbonyl group, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, and then a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Wait, let's try to consider the possible structures based on the NMR signals.

The substituent on the benzene could be:

- A -COOH group (para-substituted), leading to the aromatic protons as described.
- A chain that includes a CH group (from the 2.9 ppm peak), which is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, doublet) and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm triplet).

Wait, that structure would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3) connected to the benzene. Let me draw it out mentally: benzene ring with a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the para position. So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Wait, but that would be an ethyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to two CH2 groups. Let me think of a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring. Let me see: the CH2 would be connected to the ring, then a CH connected to a CH2CH3 and another CH2 group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The -CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH would have a triplet around 2.9 ppm (maybe a multiplet), the adjacent CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm, and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm. But wait, the CH3 in the substituent would have a triplet? Or a doublet?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Another possibility is that the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that would give different NMR signals.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (let's say at position 4) would have protons that are split into a triplet due to neighboring CH. Wait, but the substituent in the NMR is a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH(CH3)-, where the CH is connected to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent: -CH2CH(CH3)COOH? No, but I don't see a COOH group in the NMR except for the broad peak at 10.5 ppm.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is likely the -OH of a carboxylic acid. So maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent attached, such as a chain that includes sec-butyl.

Wait, let me try to build the structure. The benzene ring has a -COOH group in position 1 and another substituent in position 4.

The substituent in position 4 is a chain that includes a CH connected to a CH2 and a CH2CH3.

So the substituent would be something like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring: positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but then the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me consider how that would split.

In para-substituted benzoic acid, the protons ortho to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield, and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be less downfield. But the substituent in position 4 is another group, which would affect the chemical shifts. Hmm, perhaps this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in position 4 is a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. Let me think of the substituent as a -OCH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOH group. Then, the structure would be a benzene ring with a para-substituted -CH2COOH group. But then, the -COOH would have a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, and the -CH2 would be adjacent. But looking at the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm could be the CH2 adjacent to the COOH. Wait, but the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't fit a CH2 group (which would have 2H). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let's imagine the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH group (the one attached to the ring) would have a triplet integrating to 1H (since it's a CH with two neighboring CH2 groups?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. Then, the CH2 would have protons that are split into a triplet, but again, the NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group, perhaps attached to two different groups, like a CH between two CH2 groups.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, that would make the structure benzene-CH(CH2CH3)CH2-something. But I'm not seeing the something yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be benzene with a para-substituted group of -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me consider that.

In that case, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4. The CH2 attached to the ring (position 4) would have two protons that are split by the adjacent CH group. Then, the CH group (position 4's substituent) would have one proton, which would be a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH2 group and perhaps another group. Wait, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would correspond to that CH group. Then the CH2 group would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to the CH group. Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the CH is connected to two CH2 groups. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no, that's a ethyl group with a branch. Let me think: substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- something else?

Wait, maybe the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. But then, the COOH would be at the end, and the substituent would be a pentyl group or similar.

But that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch and a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction conditions: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI elimination reaction, which is typically used to dehydrate alcohols or to eliminate vicinal diols to form alkenes. Alternatively, it can also be used for the elimination of HX from amines, but that's less likely here.

Wait, another reaction: the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction? No, that's for ketones using aluminum isopropoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, another thought: sometimes, when an alcohol is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to convert the alcohol into an alkyl iodide via substitution. For example, if the compound is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, treatment with HI and PPh3 (triphenylphosphine) would lead to substitution, producing the alkyl iodide. But I'm not exactly sure about the conditions.

Wait, but wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the reaction is known as the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but I think that's more for ketones. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to generate H-I for substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group is replaced by iodide. For example, if the compound has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate, HI would substitute it with iodide. But in this case, Compound X might have a hydroxyl group, which could be activated for substitution.

Wait, but if X has a hydroxyl group, then reacting it with HI and P would likely lead to the formation of an iodide. So if X is an alcohol, the reaction would convert it into an alkyl iodide.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are iodides. All the options are either acids or substituted benzene rings. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of H2O from a compound that has adjacent hydroxyl groups, forming an alkene. But again, looking at the options, they don't seem to involve alkenes.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is a benzyl alcohol derivative, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to substitution, producing a benzyl iodide. But again, the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me first figure out what Compound X is, and then I'll think about the reaction.

So, going back to the NMR and IR. Let me try to outline the structure.

1. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. The broad peak in IR (3400–2500 cm-1) suggests an O-H group, possibly a carboxylic acid. So, a compound with both a carbonyl and a carboxylic acid group? Or maybe it's an ester. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but 1720 is a bit higher, so maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but then there wouldn't be an O-H group.

Wait, but the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. So the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, and the carbonyl is from that as well.

So, Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent. Let me try to figure out the substituent based on the NMR.

The substituent must have a chain that leads to the NMR signals we're seeing: 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

This seems like a chain that starts with a CH2 group attached to the benzene, then a CH, then a CH2CH3.

Wait, more accurately, the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3) group connected via a CH2 to the ring. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. But that would make the substituent a pentyl group leading to a COOH.

Wait, but the NMR shows the 10.5 ppm as a singlet, which is the COOH -OH. The aromatic protons would then be the ortho and meta to the COOH. Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a longer chain, which might complicate the aromatic shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2 and then a CH2CH3.

Wait, let's try to build the substituent. The substituent on the benzene ring is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. But what's the 'something'? Well, the 10.5 ppm suggests a COOH group, so perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. But that would make the substituent a propyl group leading to a COOH.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH group. Let me think about the NMR signals for that.

In that case, the CH2 attached to the ring (position 4) would have two protons, which might be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH. The CH group would have one proton, split by the adjacent CH2 and any other groups. The CH2CH3 group would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

In the NMR data given, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would correspond to the CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a bit confusing. If the CH is connected to a CH2CH3, then the CH3 would be a triplet, but the data shows 0.9 ppm as a triplet (3H), which fits the CH2CH3. But the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) doesn't fit that.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data either.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH(CH3)CH2- something. But then, the NMR would have signals for the CH2 and CH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is an isopropyl group. But that would give a singlet for the CH3 groups, which is not what the data shows.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would then show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (position 4) would have two protons, which might be a triplet (if adjacent to a CH group). But the data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a single proton.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3). The CH2 would have two protons (maybe as a triplet), the CH would have one proton (as a septet?), but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which could fit the CH group. Then, the CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which matches the data. But what about the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the benzene. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Then, the CH2 would have two protons (maybe as a triplet), the CH would have one proton (as a multiplet), and the CH2CH3 would have three protons as a triplet. That would explain the 0.9 ppm triplet.

But then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) don't fit. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group, but the CH is connected to another CH2 group, making it a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The CH2 would have two protons (maybe as a triplet), the CH would have one proton (as a multiplet), and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet. That fits the 0.9 ppm triplet.

But then, what about the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Those don't seem to fit. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached directly to the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Let me see:

- The aromatic protons would be in two doublets due to the substituent being in the para position. That fits.
- The substituent CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH group (1H, maybe as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm) and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.
- But the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) don't fit here either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3). The CH2 would have two protons (maybe as a triplet), the CH would have one proton (as a multiplet), and the CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But again, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) don't seem to match. Maybe I'm not considering the correct substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let's see: the CH would have one proton (multiplet at 2.9 ppm), the CH2 would have two protons (1.7 ppm, multiplet), and the CH2CH3 would have three protons (0.9 ppm, triplet). The CH2 attached to the CH would be between the two CH2 groups, leading to the 1.7 ppm signal. The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, but wait, how? Because if the CH is connected to a CH2CH3, then the CH3 would be a triplet, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the CH is connected to a CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to the ring. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The CH2 would have two protons (maybe as a triplet), the CH would have one (multiplet), and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm. But I'm still not matching the 1.7 and 1.4 signals.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is benzene-CH(CH3)CH2-something. But what's 'something'? If it's a COOH group, then the substituent would be benzene-CH(CH3)CH2COOH. In that case, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 group (attached to the ring) would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet.
- The CH group (CH(CH3)) would have one proton, as a multiplet.
- The CH3 attached to the CH would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But then, what about the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Wait, the 1.4 ppm would be a CH3 attached to a CH, which is then attached to another group. So perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3). No, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But that would give a singlet for the CH3 groups, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the ring. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Then, the NMR would show:

- CH2 (ring-attached): maybe a triplet at 1.7 ppm? No, the 1.7 ppm is 2H, which could be the CH2 group.
- CH (middle): 1H at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.
- CH2CH3 (end): 3H as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would not fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that seems unlikely because that would require a longer chain, and the NMR doesn't show a peak at lower ppm for a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the ring, and then another CH2CH3 group attached to the CH. That would make the substituent benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group with a branch. Let's see:

So the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The NMR would then have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (position 4): 2H, perhaps as a triplet.
- The CH(CH3) group: 1H, as a multiplet.
- The CH2 between CH(CH3) and CH3: 2H, perhaps as a quartet.
- The CH3 attached to the CH(CH3): 3H, as a triplet.

But in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could be the CH2 between the ring and the CH. The 2.9 ppm would be the CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH2CH3. But wait, in this structure, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, which would make the NMR signals as described.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent is a 3-pentyl group? No, more accurately, it's a 2-methylpropyl group attached via a CH2 to the ring. That would make the substituent a 4-methylpentyl group or something similar.

Wait, but the substituent being a 4-ethyl group? Let me try to think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, making it a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have the structure: CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In that case, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H, as a triplet. But in the data, the 1.7 ppm is 2H as a multiplet, which could fit.
- The CH (from CH(CH2CH3)): 1H, as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.
- The CH2CH3 group: 3H, as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But then, where do the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come into play? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing another CH3 group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the ring, and the COOH is part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)COOH group attached to the ring. Then the structure would be benzene-CH(CH2CH3)COOH. But that would make the substituent a propyl group leading to a COOH, which would fit the IR and NMR data.

In this case, the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CH3)COOH. So the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4, which is a -CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the COOH. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH

But wait, that would make the substituent a propyl group attached to the COOH, which is attached to the benzene. Hmm.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be para to the substituent, leading to two doublets. The substituent's CH would appear as a multiplet, the CH2CH3 as a triplet, and the COOH's -OH as a broad singlet.

But then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would not fit, as there's no CH3 attached to a CH in this structure. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOH group attached to the benzene. Then, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-COOH. The NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H as a triplet.
- The COOH's -OH as a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm.
- The aromatic protons as two doublets.

But then, what about the other NMR signals (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9)? They don't fit this structure, so this can't be right.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the options and see which ones fit the NMR and IR data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Let's analyze each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: Ph-CH2-COOH, where Ph is a 4-ethylphenyl group. So the benzene ring has an ethyl group in the para position relative to the propanoic acid group.

Wait, no. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the structure: the propanoic acid group is attached to the benzene ring at position 2, and the ethyl group is at position 4 (para to the propanoic acid group).

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. The substituents are at positions 2 and 4 on the benzene ring. The propanoic acid group is at position 2, and the ethyl group is at position 4.

But wait, the substituents would be at positions 2 (COOH) and 4 (ethyl). The aromatic protons would be ortho and para to the substituents, leading to a certain NMR pattern.

But according to the NMR data, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So this structure would fit that. But what about the other NMR signals? The propanoic acid would have a CH2 group between the benzene and the COOH.

So the substituent would be -CH2-COOH attached to the benzene at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

The 1H NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, which matches.
- The -CH2- group from the propanoic acid: would appear as a triplet around 2.5 ppm or so, but the data has 2.9 ppm as a multiplet of 1H. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain. But this might not fit.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group at position 4. Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are at position 4 and another position? No, the name would indicate that the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the sec-butyl group is also at position 4. But that can't be; a benzene ring can't have two substituents at the same position. So perhaps the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4.

Wait, the name is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which means the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl substituent is at position 4 (para to the COOH).

So the structure is:

benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

The substituents are para to each other.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to the substituents. The COOH at position 1 would cause the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) to be downfield, and the substituent at position 4 would affect the protons at positions 3 and 5.

But the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That would fit if the substituents are in the para positions, causing the aromatic protons to split into two sets.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H, perhaps as a triplet.
- The CH (from CH(CH2CH3)): 1H, as a multiplet.
- The CH2CH3 group: 3H, as a triplet.

But in the data, we have:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely the CH group.
1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe the CH2 group.
1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH (from the substituent).
0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the CH2CH3 group.

Wait, in the substituent CH2-CH(CH2CH3), the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, so the CH2 would have two protons that are split into a triplet, perhaps at 1.7 ppm. The CH would have one proton at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet. The CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm. But where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? Because the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), the CH3 is at the end of the chain, so it would appear as a triplet, not a doublet. So the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) doesn't fit this structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit that either.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Structure: benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4 (para to the sec-butyl). So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents are at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That fits the NMR data.

The substituent sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H, as a triplet around 1.7 ppm.
- The CH group: 1H as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.
- The CH2CH3 group: 3H as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But according to the data, there's also a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). This would not fit unless there's another CH3 group attached. But in this structure, the methyl group is at position 4, which is a single CH3 attached to the ring. So the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) doesn't fit. Hmm.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Structure: benzene ring with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

Isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is a branched group.

The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each 2H, which fits the NMR.

The substituent isobutyl group would have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H (maybe as a triplet around 1.7 ppm).
- The CH (from isobutyl) would have 1H as a multiplet (2.9 ppm).
- The two CH3 groups attached to the CH would be as singlets, but in reality, they would appear as a septet due to splitting, but in the NMR data, they don't seem to appear. Alternatively, the methyl groups would be as singlets, but the data doesn't show that.

But according to the data, the substituent has a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would fit if it's a CH3 attached to a CH. But in the isobutyl group, the CH3 groups are attached to a CH, which is then attached to a CH2 and the ring. So each CH3 would be a singlet, but the NMR doesn't show that. So this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a different group. Let me think again.

Going back to the reaction part: the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the product is one of the options, which are all substituted benzenes, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where an -OH group is replaced by an iodide, but that's not leading to any of the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent on the benzene ring is an alcohol group, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would convert the alcohol into an iodide. But none of the options have iodide substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced, but I'm not seeing how that leads to the given options.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a tosyl or mesyl group which is replaced by iodide. But again, the options don't include iodides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, such as the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. But I'm not seeing any ketones in the starting material.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration. For example, if the starting material has adjacent -OH groups, they could be eliminated to form an alkene. But none of the options have alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the elimination of HX from diols to form alkenes (the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction isn't correct here). Alternatively, if the starting material is a vicinal dihalide, HI can cause elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where an -OH is replaced by -I. So, if the starting material has an -OH group attached to a benzene ring, the reaction would produce a benzyl iodide. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a phenol, which would react with HI and red phosphorus to form a benzyl iodide. But again, the options don't show that.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck trying to figure out the reaction without knowing the structure of Compound X. Let me try to make a connection between the options and the data.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (ortho and para to substituents), which fits.
- The sec-butyl group would have signals at 1.7 ppm (CH2), 2.9 ppm (CH), and 0.9 ppm (CH2CH3).
- Where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come in? Because in the sec-butyl group, the CH is connected to a CH2 group and a CH2CH3. So the CH3 is at the end, appearing as a triplet at 0.9 ppm. There's no CH3 attached to the CH in the substituent, so the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) doesn't fit. So option C might not be correct.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with a propanoic acid group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each 2H, which fits.

The substituent propanoic acid would have a CH2 group between the benzene and the COOH. The CH2 would appear as a triplet around 2.5 ppm, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet of 1H. That doesn't fit.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Structure: benzene with isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

The substituent isobutyl group would have:

- CH2 attached to the ring (1.7 ppm, triplet)
- CH (2.9 ppm, multiplet)
- Two CH3 groups (each 3H, as septet or singlet?)

But the NMR data doesn't show two CH3 groups, only a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So this might not fit.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Structure: benzene with sec-butyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

The substituent sec-butyl group would have:

- CH2 attached to ring (1.7 ppm, triplet)
- CH (2.9 ppm, multiplet)
- CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet)

The methyl at position 4 would appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm (assuming -CH3 attached to ring), but the NMR doesn't show a peak around there. So perhaps this isn't it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, and the other substituent is a sec-butyl. Then, the methyl would be at position 4, and the sec-butyl at position 1.

But the NMR doesn't show a peak for the methyl group attached to the ring, unless it's integrated into the aromatic region. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1.

The NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.
- The sec-butyl group: CH2 at 1.7 ppm (triplet), CH at 2.9 ppm (multiplet), CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (triplet).

But the data also shows a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which doesn't fit. So perhaps this isn't the correct option.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent isn't a sec-butyl group but a different branched chain. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached via a CH2 to the ring. Then, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the NMR would show:

- CH2 (ring attached): triplet at 1.7 ppm.
- CH (from CH(CH3)2): multiplet at 2.9 ppm.
- The two CH3 groups: each as septets or singlets.

But the data shows a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which doesn't fit with this structure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to make a different approach. Let's think about the reaction again. The reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. If the product is one of the options, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of an -OH group with iodide. But looking at the options, none are iodides. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to eliminate a molecule of water from a diol, forming an alkene. So if Compound X is a diol, the reaction would form an alkene. But looking at the options, none are alkenes. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. So if Compound X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or a mesylate, the reaction would substitute it with iodide. But again, none of the options are iodides.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce esters or ketones to alcohols. But without knowing the structure of X, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. For example, if X is an ester, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But that doesn't fit the options either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize what I've found so far.

The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent that includes a branched chain, possibly a -CH(CH2CH3) group or similar. The substituent's NMR signals don't perfectly fit any of the options, but option C seems to be the closest fit, despite the discrepancy in the 1.4 ppm peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3) group, which would lead to a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) for the CH3 attached to the CH. So, if the substituent is a -CH(CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the ring, that would explain the 1.4 ppm peak.

Wait, let me think again. If the substituent is a -CH(CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the ring, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3). The NMR would show:

- CH2 (ring attached): triplet at 1.7 ppm.
- CH (from CH(CH3)): multiplet at 2.9 ppm.
- CH3 (from CH(CH3)): septet at around 1.3 ppm? Or as a doublet if split by the CH.

But in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which would fit a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3) group attached via a CH2 to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3).

In that case, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then, the substituent is a propyl group leading to a COOH. But then the substituent would have CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

But then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets because of the substituent at position 1 (COOH) and the substituent at position 4 (CH2-CH(CH3)).

Wait, but the substituent is at position 4, so the COOH is at position 1, and the CH2-CH(CH3) is at position 4. That would make the aromatic protons into two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

The substituent's NMR would show:

- CH2 (ring attached): triplet at 1.7 ppm.
- CH (from CH(CH3)): multiplet at 2.9 ppm.
- CH3 (from CH(CH3)): doublet at 1.4 ppm due to coupling with the CH.
- The CH2CH3 group isn't present, so the 0.9 ppm peak wouldn't fit. Hmm, but the data shows a 0.9 ppm triplet, which suggests a CH2CH3 group.

So perhaps the substituent is a longer chain, like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Then, the substituent is a butyl group leading to a COOH.

In this case, the substituent would have:

- CH2 (ring attached): 2H as a triplet at 1.7 ppm.
- CH (from CH(CH2CH3)): 1H as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.
- CH2CH3 (from CH(CH2CH3)): 3H as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.
- The CH2 in the middle (from CH(CH2CH3)) would have 2H, but where is that in the data? The data has 1.7 ppm (2H, m) and 1.4 ppm (3H, d). So perhaps the middle CH2 is at 1.4 ppm, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that's getting too long.

I'm running out of time, so I'll have to make a decision based on the options and the data. The best fit seems to be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Despite the discrepancy in the 1.4 ppm peak, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the 1.4 ppm peak could be an impurity or another group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a COOH group and a sec-butyl substituent. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches. The substituent's CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, CH at 2.9 ppm, and CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) doesn't fit, but maybe it's a mistake or perhaps it's another group I'm not considering.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR data shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is higher than the typical 1700 cm-1 for a carboxylic acid. This suggests it might be an ester or a ketone. But the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

So perhaps the compound is an ester with a carboxylic acid group, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an -OH group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but based on the NMR and IR data, the structure seems to be a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branched substituent. The options suggest that option C is the most plausible, despite the 1.4 ppm peak not fitting perfectly.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, based on its IR and NMR data. The analysis of the spectral data and the options is as follows:

### Key Observations from IR and NMR Data:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).
   - A broad peak in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** region indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to other groups.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, consistent with a CH₂CH₃ group.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**
- Structure: A benzene ring with a propanoic acid group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4 (para to the propanoic acid group).
- The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR data. However, the CH₂ group between the benzene and the COOH group would appear as a triplet around 2.5 ppm, which does not match the observed 2.9 ppm multiplet.  
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the data.

#### **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.
- The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR data. However, the isobutyl group would produce signals for two CH₃ groups (likely as septets or singlets), which are not observed in the NMR data. Additionally, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) does not fit this structure.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the data.

#### **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**
- Structure: A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.
- The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR data. The sec-butyl group would produce signals at:
  - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: The CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
  - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: The CH group.
  - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: The CH₂CH₃ group.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** does not directly fit this structure, but it could be attributed to a minor impurity or an alternative interpretation of the substituent. This option aligns most closely with the data.
- **Conclusion**: Fits the data reasonably well.

#### **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**
- Structure: A benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.
- The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR data. However, the methyl group at position 4 would produce a singlet around 2.3 ppm, which is not observed in the NMR data. Additionally, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) does not fit this structure.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the data.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions suggest a substitution or elimination process. Given the spectral data and the reaction conditions, the most plausible product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C), as it aligns with the para-substitution pattern and the observed NMR signals.

ANSWER: C
