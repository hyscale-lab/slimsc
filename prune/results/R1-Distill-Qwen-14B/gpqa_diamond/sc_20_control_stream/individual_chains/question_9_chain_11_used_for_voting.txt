Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... what does that mean again? Oh right, symmetry elements. Let me think. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for a proper rotation axis, and the subscript '3' means it's a three-fold rotation. The 'h' indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, or is it a vertical mirror plane? No, wait, h symmetry usually refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So, when you combine a rotation and a mirror plane, you get this overall symmetry.

Now, looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think I'll need to examine each compound's structure to see which has the required symmetry.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. Its structure is B with three isopropyl groups attached. So, structure-wise, each isopropyl is a substituent on boron. Since all three are identical, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis around the boron atom. But what about mirror planes? Triisopropyl borate, I recall, has a trigonal planar geometry, so it would have a horizontal mirror plane because each substituent is symmetric across that plane. So that would make it C3h symmetry. So this could be a candidate.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bridged bicyclo structure. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, I think. Wait, no, quinuclidine is the nitrogen-containing analog. Its structure is like a cube part. It has a high degree of symmetry. Let me think about its symmetry elements. Quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis, as the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees and look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a cube, so maybe it has multiple planes of symmetry, but I'm not certain if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it has a three-fold axis but lacks the mirror plane, or perhaps the mirror plane is vertical. Wait, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane, but that plane might not be horizontal. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is higher, like Td, but I'm not certain. I might need to think more about this.

Options A and B are more complex with furan rings and substituents. Let's look at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, benzo fused with three furan rings. So, the numbering suggests that the substituents are attached in a way that each c is part of a bridge. Wait, benzo is a benzene ring, but in this case, it's a fused system with multiple furan rings. The hexa-one part suggests ketone groups at certain positions. For such a system, the symmetry might be higher. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe with three-fold symmetry. But I'm not exactly sure. It's possible that benzo-based systems have a central axis but maybe not the mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a three-fold rotation but without a mirror plane. Hmm, not certain.

Option A is triphenyleno... something trifuran. Wait, that's a more complex system. Triphenylene connected to trifuran rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central axis, perhaps that's C3h. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a case where the molecule has a three-fold axis but the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal, so that would be a different symmetry group. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane at all, just a three-fold rotation, which would be C3. But wait, the question is about C3h, which requires both.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry would mean that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that includes that axis. So, when you rotate 120 degrees around the axis and then reflect across the mirror plane, the structure remains the same.

Thinking about triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is attached to boron. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron. So, if I imagine a horizontal plane cutting through the boron, each isopropyl is symmetric across that plane. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would cycle the substituents, and a reflection across the horizontal plane would also leave the structure unchanged. So triisopropyl borate has both a C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. That makes sense.

What about quinuclidine? Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen. It has a three-fold rotation axis, yes. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If you imagine looking at it from the top, is there a plane that reflects it onto itself? Or is the mirror plane a different orientation?

Wait, I'm trying to visualize quinuclidine. It's a cube-like structure, but with a nitrogen. So, each of the three faces is equivalent. So, perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the molecule is viewed along the axis that goes through the nitrogen and the center, then a horizontal plane cutting through the center would reflect the molecule onto itself. Because each of the three faces is symmetric. So, in that case, quinuclidine would have a C3h symmetry.

Wait, now I'm confused. Because if both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have C3h symmetry, but the options may have different structures.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a mirror plane. Wait, no. The molecule is symmetric across the plane passing through the boron and the midpoints of each isopropyl group. Because each isopropyl is a mirror image across that plane. So the mirror plane is indeed present.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each compound's point group. Triisopropyl borate is probably in the C3h point group. Quinuclidine, being a chair-like structure with a three-fold axis and a plane, might be in D3h. Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry, with more mirror planes. Alternatively, quinuclidine's symmetry is higher.

Wait, let me think. The point group of quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure is a cube with a nitrogen. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and also a horizontal mirror plane (h). So, that would make the point group C3h. Or wait, does it have more symmetry elements? For example, if there are multiple mirror planes, then the point group might be higher, like D3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the point groups. For a molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, the point group is C3h. If it also has other mirror planes (like three vertical ones), then the point group would be D3h.

So, triisopropyl borate: is the structure trigonal planar. Each isopropyl is symmetric. So, the molecule has a C3 axis (rotation) and a horizontal mirror plane. So, point group C3h.

Quinuclidine: looking up in my mind, I think it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but it also has other mirror planes perpendicular to the C3 axis, so that would make it D3h symmetry. Wait, so if it's D3h, then it's not C3h. So, the point group would be different.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the actual structures.

In triisopropyl borate, each substituent is attached to the central boron. The structure is like a trigonal planar. So, for each substituent, the mirror plane would pass through the boron and the middle of each isopropyl group. If you rotate 120 degrees, the substituents are permuted, and reflecting across the mirror plane (which is the same as each substituent's plane) leaves the molecule unchanged. So that's C3h.

In quinuclidine, the molecule is more like a cube. So, if you imagine rotating 120 degrees around the three-fold axis (say, through the nitrogen and the opposite carbon), the structure looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's say the plane passes through the center of the molecule, cutting it into top and bottom halves. If the top and bottom are mirror images, then yes. In quinuclidine, when viewed from above, each face is symmetric. So perhaps a horizontal mirror plane exists. But does it also have vertical mirror planes? For example, planes that cut through the molecule along the C3 axis and a pair of opposite positions. If yes, then the point group would be D3h, which includes both C3 and h. But wait, D3h also includes other mirror planes. So, quinuclidine, if it has D3h symmetry, would have more symmetry elements than C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane. Let me think again. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. Each face is a triangle, so perhaps each face is symmetric. So, when you look through the molecule along the three-fold axis, each face is a mirror image. So a horizontal mirror plane through the center would reflect each face. So the symmetry would be C3h. Or maybe D3h if there are more mirror planes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. Which of these options is known to have C3h symmetry?

From what I recall, triisopropyl borate does have C3h symmetry. It's a common example. Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think it belongs to a higher symmetry group, perhaps C3v or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the other options have C3h symmetry. Let's look at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, that's a system with three furan rings attached to a benzene ring. The numbering suggests that each of the c positions is connected as bridges. Wait, perhaps each furan ring is connected to the benzene in a way that creates a symmetric structure. So, if the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around the benzene, then the molecule might have a three-fold rotation axis. But would it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar and has a three-fold axis, but no mirror plane. Or maybe the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. So, if the mirror plane is vertical, it would be part of the C3v point group, not C3h.

Option A is triphenyleno... something. Triphenylene is a structure with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, each attached to a central ring. If it's connected to trifuran rings, perhaps the arrangement is symmetric. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps each of the three substituents is symmetric across a horizontal plane, leading to C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a horizontal mirror plane, only a vertical one.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry requires that after a three-fold rotation and then a reflection across the horizontal plane, the molecule looks the same. Which of these structures would satisfy that?

Triisopropyl borate: when you rotate 120 degrees, the substituents move, and then reflecting across the horizontal plane (the plane through boron) leaves the structure unchanged. So that works.

Quinuclidine: if after a three-fold rotation and then a reflection across a horizontal plane, the molecule remains the same. Let's say the reflection plane is through the center and perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees and then reflect, does it look the same? If yes, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's mirror planes are vertical, which would make it C3v instead.

Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is in the same plane as the three-fold axis, making it a horizontal plane.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the options are.

The question is, which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno... something.

B) benzo... something.

C) triisopropyl borate.

D) quinuclidine.

So, the answer is either C or D, or perhaps A or B.

From what I remember, triisopropyl borate is a classic example of a molecule with C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine, I think, has a higher symmetry group, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another thought: C3h requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if the molecule is not planar, the mirror plane must be a plane that cuts through the molecule in a certain way.

Triisopropyl borate is planar (if the boron is in a trigonal planar geometry). So, the horizontal plane is the one through boron.

Quinuclidine, being a bicyclic structure, is not planar. So, a horizontal mirror plane would have to cut through the molecule in a way that reflects parts onto each other. I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno... has the required symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. If each benzene is attached to a central furan ring, perhaps arranged in a symmetric fashion, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But without seeing the exact structure, it's a bit hard to be certain.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed to test whether you know which of these structures has C3h symmetry.

So, based on what I know, triisopropyl borate definitely has C3h symmetry because of its trigonal planar structure with three identical substituents.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think has a higher symmetry. Let me think of the point group of quinuclidine. It has a three-fold axis (C3), and also three planes of symmetry that pass through each of the three pairs of opposite positions, making it D3h symmetry. Because D3h includes C3, h (horizontal), and other vertical mirror planes. So, if quinuclidine is D3h, then it has more symmetry than C3h.

So, quinuclidine's point group is D3h, which is a higher symmetry, so it doesn't match the C3h question.

So, the correct answer would be triisopropyl borate, option C.

But wait, looking back at the options:

The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

The question lists the options as:

A) triphenyleno... [some structure]

B) benzo... [another structure]

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, according to this, the correct answer would be option C. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought triisopropyl borate is option C. Or have I mixed up the options?

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the answer is C) triisopropyl borate.

But wait, another angle: perhaps one of the other options has C3h symmetry. For example, the benzo... structure might have three substituents equally spaced around a central point, leading to a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So, I imagine that the benzene is fused with three furan rings, each in positions that are 120 degrees apart. If that's the case, then the molecule might have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the benzo... structure has a C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane but not a horizontal one.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar and has a horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3h.

Wait, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me think of each molecule again.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, three identical substituents. C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: D3h symmetry, higher than C3h.

Option B: benzo... structure. If it's a symmetric arrangement of three furan rings around a central benzene, perhaps in a way that creates a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. In that case, it would have C3h.

But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a horizontal mirror plane, making the symmetry C3 without h.

Alternatively, maybe the benzo... structure doesn't have a mirror plane at all, so it would be C3, not C3h.

So, considering all this, the only one I'm confident about is option C, triisopropyl borate, having C3h symmetry. So the answer should be C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). The analysis for each option is as follows:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with trifuran rings. While the structure is complex and symmetric, the arrangement of the substituents does not clearly indicate the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. The symmetry is likely higher or different, making this option unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a benzene ring fused with three furan rings in a symmetric arrangement. While there is a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), the molecule does not appear to have a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it may have vertical mirror planes, which would correspond to **C₃v** symmetry, not **C₃h**. Thus, this option is also unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. This molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) that passes through the boron atom and the midpoints of the isopropyl groups. Both the rotation and reflection leave the molecule unchanged, confirming **C₃h** symmetry. This option is a strong candidate.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework containing a nitrogen atom. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and multiple mirror planes, including vertical ones. However, its symmetry is higher than **C₃h**, belonging to the **D₃h** point group. Since **D₃h** includes additional symmetry elements beyond **C₃h**, this option does not match the required symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements. It has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... what does that mean again? Oh right, symmetry elements. Let me think. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for a proper rotation axis, and the subscript '3' means it's a three-fold rotation.

No, wait, h symmetry usually refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So, when you combine a rotation and a mirror plane, you get this overall symmetry.

Now, looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think I'll need to examine each compound's structure to see which has the required symmetry.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. Its structure is B with three isopropyl groups attached. So, structure-wise, each isopropyl is a substituent on boron. Since all three are identical, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis around the boron atom. But what about mirror planes? Triisopropyl borate, I recall, has a trigonal planar geometry, so it would have a horizontal mirror plane because each substituent is symmetric across that plane. So that would make it C3h symmetry. So this could be a candidate.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bridged bicyclo structure. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, I think. Wait, no, quinuclidine is the nitrogen-containing analog. Its structure is like a cube part. It has a high degree of symmetry. Let me think about its symmetry elements. Quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis, as the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees and look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a cube, so maybe it has multiple planes of symmetry, but I'm not certain if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it has a three-fold axis but lacks the mirror plane, or perhaps the mirror plane is vertical. Wait, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane, but that plane might not be horizontal. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is higher, like Td, but I'm not certain. I might need to think more about this.

Options A and B are more complex with furan rings and substituents. Let's look at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, benzo fused with three furan rings. So, the numbering suggests that the substituents are attached in a way that each c is part of a bridge. Wait, benzo is a benzene ring, but in this case, it's a fused system with multiple furan rings. The hexa-one part suggests ketone groups at certain positions. For such a system, the symmetry might be higher. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe with three-fold symmetry. But I'm not exactly sure. It's possible that benzo-based systems have a central axis but maybe not the mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a three-fold rotation but without a mirror plane. Hmm, not certain.

Option A is triphenyleno... something trifuran. Wait, that's a more complex system. Triphenylene connected to trifuran rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central axis, perhaps that's C3h. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a case where the molecule has a three-fold axis but the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal, so that would be a different symmetry group. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane at all, just a three-fold rotation, which would be C3. But wait, the question is about C3h, which requires both.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry would mean that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that includes that axis. So, when you rotate 120 degrees around the axis and then reflect across the mirror plane, the structure remains the same.

Thinking about triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is attached to boron. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron. So, if I imagine a horizontal plane cutting through the boron, each isopropyl is symmetric across that plane. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would cycle the substituents, and a reflection across the horizontal plane would also leave the structure unchanged. So triisopropyl borate has both a C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. That makes sense.

What about quinuclidine? Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen. It has a three-fold rotation axis, yes. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If you imagine looking at it from the top, is there a plane that reflects it onto itself? Or is the mirror plane a different orientation?

Wait, I'm trying to visualize quinuclidine. It's a cube-like structure, but with a nitrogen. So, each of the three faces is equivalent. So, perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the molecule is viewed along the axis that goes through the nitrogen and the center, then a horizontal plane cutting through the center would reflect the molecule onto itself. Because each of the three faces is symmetric. So, in that case, quinuclidine would have a C3h symmetry.

Wait, now I'm confused. Because if both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have C3h symmetry, but the options may have different structures.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a mirror plane. Wait, no. The molecule is symmetric across the plane passing through the boron and the midpoints of each isopropyl group. Because each isopropyl is a mirror image across that plane. So the mirror plane is indeed present.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each compound's point group. Triisopropyl borate is probably in the C3h point group. Quinuclidine, being a chair-like structure with a three-fold axis and a plane, might be in D3h. Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry, with more mirror planes. Alternatively, quinuclidine's symmetry is higher.

Wait, let me think. The point group of quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure is a cube with a nitrogen. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and also a horizontal mirror plane (h). So, that would make the point group C3h. Or wait, does it have more symmetry elements? For example, if there are multiple mirror planes, then the point group might be higher, like D3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the point groups. For a molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, the point group is C3h. If it also has other mirror planes (like three vertical ones), then the point group would be D3h.

So, triisopropyl borate: is the structure trigonal planar. Each isopropyl is symmetric. So, the molecule has a C3 axis (rotation) and a horizontal mirror plane. So, point group C3h.

Quinuclidine: looking up in my mind, I think it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but it also has other mirror planes perpendicular to the C3 axis, so that would make it D3h symmetry. Wait, so if it's D3h, then it's not C3h. So, the point group would be different.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the actual structures.

In triisopropyl borate, each substituent is attached to the central boron. The structure is like a trigonal planar. So, for each substituent, the mirror plane would pass through the boron and the middle of each isopropyl group. If you rotate 120 degrees, the substituents are permuted, and reflecting across the mirror plane (which is the same as each substituent's plane) leaves the molecule unchanged. So that's C3h.

In quinuclidine, the molecule is more like a cube. So, if you imagine rotating 120 degrees around the three-fold axis (say, through the nitrogen and the opposite carbon), the structure looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's say the plane passes through the center of the molecule, cutting it into top and bottom halves. If the top and bottom are mirror images, then yes. In quinuclidine, when viewed from above, each face is symmetric. So perhaps a horizontal mirror plane exists. But does it also have vertical mirror planes? For example, planes that cut through the molecule along the C3 axis and a pair of opposite positions. If yes, then the point group would be D3h, which includes both C3 and h. But wait, D3h also includes other mirror planes. So, quinuclidine, if it has D3h symmetry, would have more symmetry elements than C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane. Let me think again. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. Each face is a triangle, so perhaps each face is symmetric. So, when you look through the molecule along the three-fold axis, each face is a mirror image. So a horizontal mirror plane through the center would reflect each face. So the symmetry would be C3h. Or maybe D3h if there are more mirror planes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. Which of these options is known to have C3h symmetry?

From what I recall, triisopropyl borate does have C3h symmetry. It's a common example. Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think it belongs to a higher symmetry group, perhaps C3v or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the other options have C3h symmetry. Let's look at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, that's a system with three furan rings attached to a benzene ring. The numbering suggests that each of the c positions is connected as bridges. Wait, perhaps each furan ring is connected to the benzene in a way that creates a symmetric structure. So, if the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around the benzene, then the molecule might have a three-fold rotation axis. But would it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar and has a three-fold axis, but no mirror plane. Or maybe the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. So, if the mirror plane is vertical, it would be part of the C3v point group, not C3h.

Option A is triphenyleno... something. Triphenylene is a structure with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, each attached to a central ring. If it's connected to trifuran rings, perhaps the arrangement is symmetric. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps each of the three substituents is symmetric across a horizontal plane, leading to C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a horizontal mirror plane, only a vertical one.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry requires that after a three-fold rotation and then a reflection across the horizontal plane, the molecule looks the same. Which of these structures would satisfy that?

Triisopropyl borate: when you rotate 120 degrees, the substituents move, and then reflecting across the horizontal plane (the plane through boron) leaves the structure unchanged. So that works.

Quinuclidine: if after a three-fold rotation and then a reflection across a horizontal plane, the molecule remains the same. Let's say the reflection plane is through the center and perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees and then reflect, does it look the same? If yes, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's mirror planes are vertical, which would make it C3v instead.

Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is in the same plane as the three-fold axis, making it a horizontal plane.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the options are.

The question is, which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno... something.

B) benzo... something.

C) triisopropyl borate.

D) quinuclidine.

So, the answer is either C or D, or perhaps A or B.

From what I remember, triisopropyl borate is a classic example of a molecule with C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine, I think, has a higher symmetry group, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another thought: C3h requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if the molecule is not planar, the mirror plane must be a plane that cuts through the molecule in a certain way.

Triisopropyl borate is planar (if the boron is in a trigonal planar geometry). So, the horizontal plane is the one through boron.

Quinuclidine, being a bicyclic structure, is not planar. So, a horizontal mirror plane would have to cut through the molecule in a way that reflects parts onto each other. I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno... has the required symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. If each benzene is attached to a central furan ring, perhaps arranged in a symmetric fashion, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But without seeing the exact structure, it's a bit hard to be certain.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed to test whether you know which of these structures has C3h symmetry.

So, based on what I know, triisopropyl borate definitely has C3h symmetry because of its trigonal planar structure with three identical substituents.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think has a higher symmetry. Let me think of the point group of quinuclidine. It has a three-fold axis (C3), and also three planes of symmetry that pass through each of the three pairs of opposite positions, making it D3h symmetry. Because D3h includes C3, h (horizontal), and other vertical mirror planes. So, if quinuclidine is D3h, then it has more symmetry than C3h.

So, quinuclidine's point group is D3h, which is a higher symmetry, so it doesn't match the C3h question.

So, the correct answer would be triisopropyl borate, option C.

But wait, looking back at the options:

The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

The question lists the options as:

A) triphenyleno... [some structure]

B) benzo... [another structure]

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, according to this, the correct answer would be option C. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought triisopropyl borate is option C. Or have I mixed up the options?

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the answer is C) triisopropyl borate.

But wait, another angle: perhaps one of the other options has C3h symmetry. For example, the benzo... structure might have three substituents equally spaced around a central point, leading to a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So, I imagine that the benzene is fused with three furan rings, each in positions that are 120 degrees apart. If that's the case, then the molecule might have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the benzo... structure has a C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane but not a horizontal one.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar and has a horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3h.

Wait, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me think of each molecule again.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, three identical substituents. C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: D3h symmetry, higher than C3h.

Option B: benzo... structure. If it's a symmetric arrangement of three furan rings around a central benzene, perhaps in a way that creates a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. In that case, it would have C3h.

But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a horizontal mirror plane, making the symmetry C3 without h.

Alternatively, maybe the benzo... structure doesn't have a mirror plane at all, so it would be C3, not C3h.

So, considering all this, the only one I'm confident about is option C, triisopropyl borate, having C3h symmetry. So the answer should be C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). The analysis for each option is as follows:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with trifuran rings. While the structure is complex and symmetric, the arrangement of the substituents does not clearly indicate the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. The symmetry is likely higher or different, making this option unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a benzene ring fused with three furan rings in a symmetric arrangement. While there is a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), the molecule does not appear to have a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it may have vertical mirror planes, which would correspond to **C₃v** symmetry, not **C₃h**. Thus, this option is also unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. This molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) that passes through the boron atom and the midpoints of the isopropyl groups. Both the rotation and reflection leave the molecule unchanged, confirming **C₃h** symmetry. This option is a strong candidate.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework containing a nitrogen atom. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and multiple mirror planes, including vertical ones. However, its symmetry is higher than **C₃h**, belonging to the **D₃h** point group. Since **D₃h** includes additional symmetry elements beyond **C₃h**, this option does not match the required symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements. It has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.
