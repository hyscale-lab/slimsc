Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh wait, relativistic... so that means we can't just use the classical equations; we have to consider special relativity effects. Right, because at high speeds, classical mechanics doesn't hold anymore.

So the setup: the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're looking for the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, each with different expressions.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So kinetic energy (KE) at max speed would be (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = sqrt(k/m) * A. So that's option C, but I think that's for the classical case. But the question is relativistic, so option C is probably not the right answer here.

Wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I should start from energy conservation.

In the relativistic case, the oscillator's total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At the maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential is zero, and kinetic energy is maximum. So equating the total energy at x=A to that at x=0.

The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator is still (1/2)kx², right? Because Hooke's law is still F = -kx, so the potential is like (1/2)kx², same as classical.

So at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy? Wait, no. Wait, in relativity, energy conservation includes rest mass energy. So the total energy at x=A is the rest energy plus the potential energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kA². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA²? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy is part of the total mechanical energy. The total mechanical energy in classical terms is (1/2)kA². But when considering relativity, that's just the kinetic and potential parts. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. But I'm not so sure. Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is part of the mass-energy equivalence. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think again. At the maximum displacement, x = A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so the velocity is zero. So all the energy is potential energy plus rest mass energy. Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA^2, which equals (1/2)mv_max^2 at x=0. But in the relativistic case, the maximum velocity would be less than c, so perhaps the energy approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy mc² and the potential energy (1/2)kA². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is just the kinetic energy plus rest energy. Wait, but no, wait: in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ -1) mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, velocity is maximum, so the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy would be mc² (rest) plus kinetic energy. So E = mc² + kinetic energy.

But how does that relate to the potential energy at x=A? Because when the oscillator is at x=A, its velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, but the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So wait, maybe E is (1/2)kA² + mc².

So setting E equal in both cases:

At x=A: E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x=0: E = mc² + (γ -1) mc² = γ mc².

So setting them equal:

γ mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Subtract mc² from both sides:

γ mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Factor mc²:

mc² (γ -1) = (1/2)kA².

But the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So (γ-1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Because if k A² is large, then γ would be greater than 1, which is fine, but let's see.

Wait, wait, let's think again. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum. So the total energy at x=A is (1/2)kA² + mc². At x=0, the potential is zero, so the total energy is just the rest energy plus kinetic energy, which is mc² + (γ -1) mc² = γ mc².

Setting equal:

γ mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

So gamma = [ (1/2)kA² + mc² ] / (mc² )

= 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that would give gamma as 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm, that's what I had earlier.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So from gamma, we can find v_max.

So let's write gamma as:

γ = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

Wait, but wait: does that hold? Because (1/2)k A² is the potential energy, and the rest energy is mc². So in that case, the total energy is (1/2 k A²) + mc².

So the equation would be:

γ mc² = (1/2 k A²) + mc².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Yes, that's correct.

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma must be greater than 1 because the velocity is greater than zero.

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote beta as v/c. Then,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me write this as:

1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1/(1 - beta²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Taking reciprocal:

1 - beta² = 1/[ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ) ].

So,

beta² = 1 - [1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ) ].

Hmm, let's compute that.

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + d)^2 ] where d is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So 1 - 1/(1+d)^2 = [ (1+d)^2 -1 ] / (1 + d)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2d + d² - 1 ) = 2d + d².

So,

beta² = (2d + d²) / (1 + d)^2.

But d is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's denote d = a for simplicity.

So,

beta² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator:

a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, but maybe it's better to write it as:

beta² = [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1)^2.

Alternatively, let's see if we can manipulate it another way.

Wait, another approach: 1 - beta² = 1/(1 + d)^2.

So,

beta² = 1 - 1/(1 +d)^2.

Which is,

beta² = [ (1 + d)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + d)^2.

Expanding numerator again:

(1 + 2d + d² -1 ) = 2d + d².

So,

beta² = (2d + d²) / (1 + d)^2.

= [d (2 + d) ] / (1 + d)^2.

But d is small compared to 1? Not necessarily, depending on k and A.

Wait, perhaps we can write this as:

beta² = [ (d) * (d + 2) ] / (d + 1)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's take the square root of beta squared.

beta = sqrt( (2d + d²) ) / (1 + d).

Wait,

sqrt( (2d + d²) ) = sqrt( d (2 + d) ) = sqrt(d) * sqrt(2 +d).

But not sure.

So,

beta = sqrt( (2d +d²) ) / (1 + d).

Hmm, but maybe I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, let's see if any of the options match this expression.

Looking at the options.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² )

Wait, let me compute what 1 - (kA²)/(2m) is. Hmm, but in our expression above, the denominator has (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ), which is 1 + d, where d = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So in option A, the denominator is (1 - (kA²)/(2m)) which would be (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)).

But in our case, d is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so if the denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)), that would be 1 - (d c^2)/(c^2) )? Wait, no.

Wait, let me compute the denominator in option A: 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) = 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) = [2m - k A^2]/(2m).

But in our case, we have (1 + d) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So I don't see a direct match yet.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c²)) )

Hmm, wait, 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is ( (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) )/(2 m c^2 ). So 1/[1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] is (2 m c^2)/( 2 m c^2 - k A^2 ).

So the expression inside sqrt is 1 + (2 m c^2)/(2 m c^2 -k A^2 )

Which is [ (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

Which is (4 m c^2 - k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

Not sure if that helps.

Option C is v_max = sqrt( k A²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case. But since the problem is relativistic, this is probably not the right answer.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, let's compute the inside:

1 - 1/(1 + d)^2, where d= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is same as beta squared earlier.

Wait, because beta squared is (2d + d^2)/(1 + d)^2.

Wait, but option D is c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + d)^2 ), which is c * sqrt( beta^2 ) = c * beta.

So option D would be v_max = c * beta.

But from our earlier equation, beta squared is (2d +d²)/(1 +d)^2.

So sqrt of that is beta, which is v/c.

But wait, option D says v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + d)^2 )

Wait, 1 - [1/(1 + d)^2 ] equals ( (1 +d)^2 - 1 ) / (1 +d)^2 )

Which is (1 + 2d +d² -1 ) / (1 +d)^2 ) = 2d + d² / (1 +d)^2.

Which is beta squared. So sqrt that is beta, so option D gives v = c * beta, which is correct.

Wait, but option D says sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +d)^2 ), which is sqrt( beta^2 ), so it's beta, so v = c * beta. That's correct.

Hmm, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, let me compute 1 - [1/(1 +d)^2 ].

Which is [ (1 +d)^2 -1 ] / (1 +d)^2 = [ 1 + 2d + d^2 -1 ] / (1 +d)^2 = (2d + d²)/(1+d)^2 = beta^2.

So sqrt(beta^2) is beta, so v = c * beta.

So option D would be v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Which is correct.

Wait, but in our earlier steps, we had gamma = 1 +d, where d is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So which option matches this?

Looking back, option D has 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ] inside the sqrt. So that's the same as beta squared, so sqrt(beta squared) is beta, so v = c beta.

Wait, so option D gives v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +d)^2 ) = c * sqrt(beta²) = c beta.

Which is the correct expression.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the algebra to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, when I set E equal: E = (1/2)k A² + mc² = gamma mc².

So,

gamma = (1/2 k A² + mc²) / (mc²) = ( (1/2) k A²/(mc²) ) + 1.

Which is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + d, where d = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + d.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + d.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - beta²) = (1 + d)^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - beta² = 1/(1 + d)^2.

So,

beta² = 1 - 1/(1 +d)^2.

Beta is sqrt( beta squared ), so beta = sqrt( [ ( (1 +d)^2 - 1 ) ] / (1 +d)^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2d + d²) ) / (1 +d ).

But regardless, we have beta squared as in option D.

So option D is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we must consider relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic.

1. **Total Energy at \( x = A \):**  
   At maximum displacement, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Here, \( mc^2 \) is the rest energy, and \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) is the potential energy.

2. **Total Energy at \( x = 0 \):**  
   At equilibrium, the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( v \) is the maximum speed.

3. **Equating Energies:**  
   Setting the total energy at \( x = A \) equal to the total energy at \( x = 0 \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma - 1 \):  
   \[
   \gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \):**  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

5. **Matching with Options:**  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
