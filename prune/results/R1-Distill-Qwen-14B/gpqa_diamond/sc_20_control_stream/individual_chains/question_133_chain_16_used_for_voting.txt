Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^3- or PO4^3-?) in the solution. The given K_a values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12 for H3PO4.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- right? Because H3PO4 is triprotic. The different species are H3PO4 (tripotic, fully protonated), H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the question is asking for HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm, wait, maybe I should double-check that. Oh wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which is PO4^3-. Wait, no, wait. H3PO4 loses a proton to become H2PO4^-, which loses another to become HPO4^2-, which is the orthophosphate ion. Or is it the other way around? I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Let's think. H3PO4 → H2PO4^- (Ka1), H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → PO4^3- (Ka3). So when the question says orthophosphate ions, which one is it? I think orthophosphate usually refers to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm. Wait, maybe I should look that up, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed.

The presence of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 suggests a buffer solution. Because when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer. Wait, but what are their roles here?

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-), so H2PO4^- is an acid (since it can donate a proton, which is the second dissociation).

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O). Wait, I think when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (since H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-) and the acid form is HPO4^2- which can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two are adjacent species in the phosphate ion series. So when these two are present in solution, they can form a buffer. The pH of the solution will be determined by the pKa2, because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can act as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

So the buffer's pH is determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4. Let's calculate that. pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2)=0.79, so 7.79? Wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately.

Ka2 = 6.2 × 10^-8. So log(6.2) is approximately 0.792. So log(6.2e-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208. So the pH of the solution should be around 7.2, because it's a buffer made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The solution is a mix of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), so the H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. Thus, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, no, wait. Because in this case, H2PO4^- is the acid (can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the Henderson equation would apply as such.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Let me see. Orthophosphate is either HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm. Wait, I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when you have a buffer, the concentrations of the two species are determined by the amounts of each salt added.

So first, I need to calculate the moles of each phosphate species present.

Calculating moles:

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass (Mw) is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005604 mol.

So the solution has 0.007337 mol of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and 0.005604 mol of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O).

The volume is 0.2 liters, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005604 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02802 M.

Wait, but wait, the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L, right.

So now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pH is pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the numbers:

pH = 7.208 + log(0.02802 / 0.036685)

Calculating the ratio: 0.02802 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈ -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.116 ≈ 7.092.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this step is necessary for calculating the orthophosphate concentration. Wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate would be HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm, I think orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if the solution is buffered around pH ~7.09, which is near the pKa2 (7.208), the HPO4^2- concentration is a bit lower than H2PO4^- concentration. But wait, in the solution, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02802 M. So that's before considering any hydrolysis or reactions.

Wait, but perhaps the phosphate species will dissociate further. Because in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate H+ to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can act as a base (accept H+ to become PO4^3-). But since the pH is around 7.09, which is just a bit below pKa2 (7.208), so the solution is slightly acidic compared to pKa2, so the H2PO4^- would be the predominant species, with some HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

We have a buffer solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH is determined by the Henderson equation, which I calculated as approximately 7.09. Now, the phosphate species in solution can undergo further dissociation. For instance, HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+ (according to Ka3).

But since the pH is around 7.09, which is much higher than pKa3 of H3PO4, which is about 12 (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is around 11.74). So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. Because for species X^- and Y, if pH is much lower than pKa, X^- is the dominant species.

Wait, but wait, the HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- (which is the reaction: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+). The Ka for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, which is very small, meaning that HPO4^2- is a very weak acid, and under most conditions, doesn't dissociate much. So in our solution, which is at pH ~7, which is way below pKa3 (~11.74), the PO4^3- concentration would be very low. So the concentration of HPO4^2- might be considered, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering that the buffer solution's pH affects the degree of dissociation of the phosphate species.

Wait a minute. Let me clarify what the question is asking. It asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The phosphate ion series is:

H3PO4 → H2PO4^- (Ka1)

H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- (Ka2)

HPO4^2- → PO4^3- (Ka3)

So orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Because when you have HPO4^2-, it's called hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So the question is asking for PO4^3- concentration.

Wait, but in that case, in the solution, we have HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-. So how much PO4^3- would be present?

Since PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

The solution's pH is around 7.09, which is below pKa3 (11.74), so the solution is acidic relative to pKa3. Thus, the HPO4^2- would tend to stay protonated (as HPO4^2-), and PO4^3- would be minimal.

But perhaps I should calculate the concentration.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

First, we need [H+].

The pH is approximately 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.298e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.812 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, 10^0.09 is about 1.23, so 10^-0.09 is about 0.812. So 10^-7.09 is 8.12e-8 M.

So [H+] = 8.12e-8.

Now, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M (from the initial calculation).

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.12e-8 )

Let me compute that.

1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = approx 5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.12e-8: 5.0436e-14 / 8.12e-8 = approx 6.21e-7 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close to this calculation. So is the answer A?

But wait, no, because the solution might have other factors. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M is incorrect because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait no, because the initial concentration of HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.005604 mol in 0.2 L, so 0.02802 M. But in reality, some of this HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the buffer from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the [H+] is fixed by the Henderson equation. So if I calculate the [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 and the concentrations found from the buffer, that should give me the correct value.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02802 M.

[H+] = 8.12e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.12e-8 )

Let me calculate this step by step.

1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14

Divide by 8.12e-8: 5.0436e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0436 / 8.12) * 1e-6 = approx 0.621 * 1e-6 = 6.21e-7 M.

That's approximately 6.21e-7 M.

Looking at the options: option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

But wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions", which is PO4^3-, so this calculation gives the concentration of PO4^3- as approximately 6.21e-7 M. So that would be option A.

But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about orthophosphate being PO4^3- is correct, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the [PO4^3-].

Wait, maybe I should consider the exact value of [H+].

Wait, the pH was calculated as 7.092, so [H+] = 10^-7.092.

10^0.092 is about 1.234, because 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 0.092 would be a bit less. 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23, so 10^-7.092 is approximately 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, let me calculate 10^-7.092.

Using a calculator approach, 7.092 = 7 + 0.092.

10^0.092 = approximately 1.234.

So 10^-7.092 = 1e-7 * 1.234 = 1.234e-7, but wait, because 10^(-7 + 0.092) is 10^-7 * 10^0.092. Wait, no, 10^(-7.092) = 1e-7.092, which is 1e-7 * 1e-0.092. Wait, no, 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092). Wait, 10^(-0.092) is approximately 0.812.

So 1e-7 * 0.812 = 8.12e-8, as before.

So [H+] is 8.12e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.12e-8) = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.12e-8:

5.0436e-14 / 8.12e-8 = 5.0436 / 8.12 * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0436 / 8.12:

5.0436 ÷ 8.12 ≈ 0.621.

So 0.621e-6 = 6.21e-7 M.

So [PO4^3-] ≈6.21e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M), so that's the answer.

But wait, wait a second. Another thought: when you have HPO4^2- in solution, it can both donate and accept protons. But in this case, the solution is buffered by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is fixed, and any dissociation from HPO4^2- into PO4^3- is minimal and can be calculated via the Ka3 expression.

So that's correct, and the calculation leads to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, with molar masses of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005604 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M}\)
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005604}{0.2} \approx 0.02802 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to estimate pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02802}{0.036685}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.208 - 0.116 \approx 7.092
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([PO₄³⁻]\) using \( \text{Ka}_3 \)
Orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) arise from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]
- \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\)
- \(\text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\)
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = 0.02802 \, \text{M}\)

Substitute values:
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02802)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.0436 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

Answer: A
