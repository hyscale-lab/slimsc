Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, maybe. When it's heated with excess KOH, I think this is an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so probably E2 mechanism. So, two bromides leaving, forming a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, would eliminate HBr. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would likely form an alkene between C1 and C3. Wait no, wait, 1,3-dibromides elimination would form a diene? Or maybe a bridge structure because adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Hmm, but let me think. When two adjacent bromides are eliminated, they form a double bond. But in adamantane, adjacent carbons are bridgehead positions. Oh wait, no, 1 and 3 might not be directly adjacent. Wait, adamantane has the structure where each bridge is between two carbons. Let me try to visualize. Adamantane is like a diamond lattice, so the 1 and 3 positions... Maybe it's possible that the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, so when they eliminate, they form a double bond between those two bridgeheads. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed because of Bredt's rule. Hmm, wait, but adamantane's structure might allow for that because of the high stability. Or maybe it's a different kind of structure.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Because each Br leaves, taking a beta hydrogen each. Since the molecule is symmetric, maybe it forms a bicyclic diene or something. But the product is a light yellow solid. Light yellow makes me think of an alkene, maybe something with conjugated double bonds, like a diene. Or maybe it's an epoxide, but no, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl group. Oh wait, 1720 is more like a ketone or ester. Or maybe an epoxide? No, epoxides have a different IR region, like around 1200-1250 for the C-O stretch. Wait, no, 1720 is more like a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, but KOH is a base. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an elimination, forming a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? No, because diols don't have 1720. Wait, perhaps it's a ketone formed via some kind of elimination and oxidation? Hmm, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe I'm thinking wrong here.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. KOH in high heat can cause eliminations, but sometimes it can also cause substitution. But with two bromines, substitution would be unlikely unless it's a very good leaving group and under specific conditions. But more likely, it's elimination.

Wait, the problem states that product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. Hmmm. So perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? But how?

Wait, alternative approach: maybe the reaction is not an elimination but a substitution. But with excess KOH, it's more likely elimination. Wait, unless it's a geminal dihalide, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't geminal. So maybe the elimination forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the 1720 cm-1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? No, because 1,3-dibromo wouldn't form a diketone via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl somewhere else. Oh wait! Maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening of some sort. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and maybe KOH is cleaving it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. Product 1's 1H NMR has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an oxygen-bearing proton, like an -OCH2- group or something. The 2.41-2.23 region is likely CH2 or CH groups in a more shielded environment. The 1.94 ppm is possibly another CH2 group. 

Wait, another thought: the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an epoxide. But epoxide protons typically show up around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group, but then the protons adjacent would be something else. Wait, the IR at 1720 would be a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. But where would the protons be?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But diols don't have a carbonyl. But wait, with KOH, maybe it's a substitution leading to two hydroxyl groups. But 1,3-diol would have certain NMR signals. But 4.79 could be OH groups, but those usually are broad. But the question says to exclude exchangeable protons, so maybe the 4.79 is something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH heating to 240Â°C. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? But that typically involves amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl via some mechanism. Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening via elimination. For example, in a cyclic structure, eliminating two HBr would form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But then, the product would have a double bond. But the IR doesn't show a peak in the alkene region (~1650 cm-1), but it shows a peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone.

Hmm, how would that happen? Maybe the elimination leads to a carbocation, which then loses a proton to form a double bond. But wait, that's not forming a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbonyl formation. Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination that forms a ketone. But I'm not quite sure.

Another approach: perhaps the product is adamantanone. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. If one of the bridgehead carbons loses a Br and a hydrogen, forming a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating both forms a conjugated diene? No, because that would not produce a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the KOH isn't just eliminating HBr but also doing something else. Wait, KOH can cause elimination, but also in some cases, it can promote ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, the product is a ketone because of some rearrangement. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, which is then oxidized? But KOH is not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet (2H). That could be adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether's CH2. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, maybe in a ring structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. So maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Or perhaps the product is a diether? But I don't see how KOH would form an ether.

Wait, another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Each Br is replaced by OH, forming 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction. But KOH isn't a Grignard reagent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Epoxide rings would have protons around 3-4 ppm. But 4.79 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but again, the IR doesn't match.

Wait, let me think of the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 for 2H. So what structure has a carbonyl and two protons near 4.79?

Maybe it's an enol ether. Enol ethers have a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, but their protons are usually in the 4-5 ppm range, perhaps. Or maybe an ester? Ester groups have carbonyls, but the adjacent protons are typically around 4 ppm.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH2- group. But then where is the ketone? For example, if you have an adamantane ring with a ketone group and an ether linkage.

Wait, maybe the product is a mono-oxide, like a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would have two carbonyls, and the IR would show maybe two peaks, but the question states a characteristic absorbance, implying one.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. But in that case, the NMR might show different signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl-containing compound like an ester or a ketone, but I'm not seeing the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps it's an aldoxide. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH in excess could lead to a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone because of the elimination of two HBr molecules. But how?

Wait, when two adjacent bromines are eliminated, they form a double bond. But for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. But as I thought earlier, bridgehead double bonds are generally not stable, but in adamantane they might be possible due to the structure's stability. So if they form a double bond, that would have an IR peak around 1650 cm-1. But the question says the IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product is a carbonyl because of a rearrangement. For example, after elimination of HBr, maybe a carbonyl is formed via some hydride shift or similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet (2H). That could be an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be a ring of CH2 groups, maybe adamantane's structure. Then the 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2.

Hmm, putting that together, maybe product 1 is a mono-substituted adamantane with an oxygen-containing group, like an ether or an ester.

Wait, if the product is a diol, but then the IR doesn't fit. So perhaps it's a mono-ether. But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, maybe the KOH isn't just doing elimination but also some kind of substitution. But substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but with two Brs, perhaps a double substitution occurs to form an oxide.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alkoxide, but that would be a transient species and not a solid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move on to the next part and see if that helps.

So product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, heating to form product 2. Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's an acylation. Wait, but product 1's structure isn't clear yet.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol. If product 1 is an alcohol, then product 2 could be an ether if it undergoes some alkylation.

Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is used more with Friedel-Crafts, which requires aromatic rings. But adamantane isn't aromatic. So maybe it's for some kind of alkylation or acylation on adamantane.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration step. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 could cause it to lose water and form an alkene. But then product 2 would be a diene, perhaps.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about product 3. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

The question is about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is the question.

So, if product 3 is a result of ozonolysis of a diene, perhaps it's a dialdehyde or a diketone. Alternatively, if the double bond was in a ring, ozonolysis could break the ring into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 has a single double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a monoene, leading to a single cleavage.

But the key is to figure out where the most deshielded proton is in product 3. The most deshielded would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and probably show a specific coupling pattern.

In ozonolysis, when a double bond is cleaved, each fragment's end would have a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would have groups attached to the carbonyls. For example, if the double bond was between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds, each with R groups.

But how does that help me determine the coupling pattern?

Wait, let's imagine that product 2 is a monoene, say a trans double bond in adamantane. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. Each would have a carbonyl group, and the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure. If the double bond is inside, maybe ozonolysis would create two ketone groups. For example, if the double bond is in a bridge, breaking it would create two bridgeheads with carbonyls.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination. Then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

So, the most deshielded proton would be on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-... or R-CO-CH(CH3)-...

Wait, but in any case, the coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded proton, say on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, would have neighboring protons. If the adjacent group has two protons, like a CH2, then each proton would couple with two others, possibly leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent group is a CH2, each of the two protons on the adjacent group would couple with the deshielded proton, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group itself is coupled with other groups, it could split further.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH group next to another CH2 group. Let's imagine a structure like:

O= C - CH2 - CH2 - something

In this case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two protons, each coupling with the next CH2 group. So the first CH2 (adjacent to carbonyl) would have two neighboring protons from each other and perhaps coupling with protons further down.

Wait, but maybe it's more like:

O= C - CH2 - CH2 - X

The CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's call them H1 and H2) each couple with each other (giving a triplet for each due to each other) and perhaps with H3 and H4 on the next CH2 group.

Hmm, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group that's adjacent to another group.

Wait, another angle: the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group that's next to a CH2 group which is next to a CH group. Then, each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet of triplets or something.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, which is it?

If the deshielded proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (which has two protons), then each of those protons would split the signal. So the deshielded proton would be a triplet (each proton sees two others, so n+1 = 3, triplet). But if those adjacent protons are themselves split by other groups, it could get more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the deshielded proton is next to a CH group that's adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, the splitting would involve coupling with both the CH and the CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So each proton in the CH2 group would see two neighboring protons (each other), leading to a triplet. But if there's another adjacent group, say another CH2, then each of those protons would couple with that as well, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton is probably adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R'. The CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say H1 and H2) each couple with each other (so each would cause a split into a triplet if only considering each other). But H1 and H2 are also adjacent to another CH2 group (H3 and H4), which each have two protons. So each H1 and H2 would also couple with H3 and H4. Wait, but each H1 would see H2 on the same CH2 (splitting into triplet) and H3 and H4 on the next CH2.

Wait, but if H1 is adjacent to H2 (on the same CH2) and H3 and H4 on the next CH2, then H1 would split into (n+1) where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So, H1 is next to H2 (which is two Hs?), wait, no, H2 is a single H on the same CH2 as H1. Wait, no, each CH2 has two Hs. So for H1, the neighboring Hs are H2 (on the same CH2) and H3 and H4 on the next CH2.

Wait, but H1 is on a CH2, adjacent to another CH2. So, for H1, the neighboring Hs would be H2 (same CH2: one neighbor, so n=1) and H3 and H4 (next CH2: n=2). So the total splitting would be (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 *3 = 6? So a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets?

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with adjacent groups. So H1 would couple with H2 (same CH2: one neighbor) and H3 and H4 (next CH2: two neighbors). So the splitting would be (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 *3 =6, so a triplet of triplets?

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about a simple example. Suppose I have a chain like CH2-CH2-CH2.

The middle CH2's protons would see the neighboring CH2s on both sides. Each neighboring CH2 has two protons. So, each proton in the middle would couple with two on the left and two on the right. But wait, each coupling is to adjacent protons. So for each proton in the middle, it would see two on the left and two on the right. But in reality, in ethylene glycol, each CH2 is split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a CH2-CH2-CH2 group. The central CH2's protons (let's say H3 and H4) would be next to H1 and H2 on the left and H5 and H6 on the right. So each H in the middle would couple with H1, H2, H5, H6? No, because protons couple with adjacent (vicinal) protons, not across the chain. Wait, no, vicinal coupling is between adjacent carbons, so in a chain like CH2-CH2-CH2, each CH2 is adjacent to the next, so the protons on the first CH2 couple with those on the second CH2 (J coupling about 6-7 Hz), and the second with the third.

So, in that case, for the middle CH2, each proton would see two protons on the left (from the first CH2) and two on the right (from the third CH2). So each proton in the middle would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks? That's a lot, but in reality, such a splitting is rare because the coupling constants may not be equal, leading to more complex multiplets.

But in the context of the problem, the most deshielded proton is probably on a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, which in turn is adjacent to a CH group. So, the deshielded proton (H1) would have two neighboring protons (H2 and H3) on the same CH2, and another set on the adjacent CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded proton is on a CH2 adjacent to a CH group. The CH group would have two protons, so each of them would split the signal of the CH2 proton.

So, the deshielded proton (H1) is on a CH2 next to a CH (which has two protons, H2 and H3). So H1 would couple with H2 and H3. Each coupling would split the signal. Since there are two different couplings (maybe the same J), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Or, if the J values are similar, it could be a doublet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if H1 is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group, then H1 would couple with two protons from the first adjacent group and two from the next. So, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a nonaet, which isn't an option. So perhaps it's a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but the answer options don't have a nonaet. So perhaps the coupling is only from one adjacent group. Let me reevaluate.

Another approach: ozonolysis of a double bond typically leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. Suppose the double bond was between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group.

So, structure after ozonolysis might be something like O=CH2-R and R'-CH2-CO=O (but that's an ester, not the case here). Alternatively, O=CH2-CH2-... etc.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with two carbonyl groups. For instance, in a simple case, a four-carbon diene would break into two two-carbon fragments, each a ketone if the diene was internal. So, for example, ozonolysis of butane-2,3-diene would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, maybe longer fragments.

But in the case of adamantane, if the double bond is in a bridge, the ozonolysis would break the bridge into two carbonyls, each attached to a bridgehead. So, for example, if the bridge had a double bond, ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups on each bridgehead.

In that case, the resulting molecule (product 3) would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to a carbon that's part of a bridge. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

So, imagine each bridgehead now has a carbonyl group. The adjacent carbons would have CH2 groups. So, the structure might have two carbonyls, each next to a CH2 group.

So, for each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded. Let's focus on one of them.

The CH2 group next to the carbonyl would have two protons. These protons would be vicinal to the carbonyl, so they might be split by neighboring groups.

If the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, which is perhaps in a ring, then each proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

So, for each proton on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, they would see two neighboring protons on the next CH2 group. So, each would split into a triplet.

But wait, if each of these protons is also coupled with another group, like a CH group, that could add more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH group. So, each proton on the CH2 would couple with the two protons on the CH group. Wait, but CH groups only have one proton each. So, each CH2 proton would couple with one proton on the adjacent CH group.

So, each of the two protons on the CH2 would be split by the single proton on the CH group. So, each would be a doublet. But since there are two equivalent protons on the CH2, the splitting would combine into a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet due to coupling with each other.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

If the deshielded proton is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to a CH group (which has one proton), then each proton on the CH2 would couple with the single proton on the CH.

So, each CH2 proton would have a doublet. But since there are two equivalent protons on the CH2, they would each see the same coupling. So, the splitting would be as follows: each proton on the CH2 is split into a doublet (coupled with the CH's proton). But since the two CH2 protons are equivalent, their splitting combines into a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH2 group, which is next to a CH group. Then, each CH2 proton would couple with the adjacent CH2 (two protons) and the CH (one proton). So, each would have (2+1)*(1+1) = 3*2=6, leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would be if each proton is coupled with two groups, each giving a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group. So, the CH proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each coupling would be a triplet (n=2, so triplet). But since the coupling is from two different groups, it could be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is adjacent to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. So, the CH proton would couple with the first CH2 (two protons) and the second CH2 (two protons). So, each triplet would split into triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, putting this all together, the most deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to two CH2 groups, each with two protons. So, each coupling would be a triplet, and the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, a light yellow solid product (product 1) is formed. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. The Â¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41â2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm signal suggests an -OCHâ- group, while the 2.41â2.23 ppm region corresponds to CHâ or CH groups in a shielded environment. The 1.94 ppm signal likely represents another CHâ group. Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely an ether or a carbonyl-containing compound.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions or dehydration. Given the structure of product 1, this step likely forms an alkene via dehydration, resulting in a conjugated diene or a single double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, producing carbonyl-containing compounds. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyl compounds. If product 2 is a monoene, ozonolysis would yield one carbonyl compound. The most deshielded proton in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby protons.

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton**:  
   The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely on a CH or CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton would couple with neighboring protons on adjacent groups. If the structure is such that the deshielded proton is adjacent to a CHâ group (with two protons) and another CHâ group (with two protons), the splitting pattern would be a triplet of triplets. This arises because the deshielded proton couples with two protons on one CHâ group (producing a triplet) and two protons on the next CHâ group (also producing a triplet), resulting in a total of nine peaks (triplet of triplets).

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton is **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, maybe. When it's heated with excess KOH, I think this is an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so probably E2 mechanism. So, two bromides leaving, forming a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, would eliminate HBr. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would likely form an alkene between C1 and C3. Wait no, wait, 1,3-dibromides elimination would form a diene? Or maybe a bridge structure because adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Hmm, but let me think. When two adjacent bromides are eliminated, they form a double bond. But in adamantane, adjacent carbons are bridgehead positions. Oh wait, no, 1 and 3 might not be directly adjacent. Wait, adamantane has the structure where each bridge is between two carbons. Let me try to visualize. Adamantane is like a diamond lattice, so the 1 and 3 positions... Maybe it's possible that the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, so when they eliminate, they form a double bond between those two bridgeheads. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed because of Bredt's rule. Hmm, wait, but adamantane's structure might allow for that because of the high stability. Or maybe it's a different kind of structure.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Because each Br leaves, taking a beta hydrogen each. Since the molecule is symmetric, maybe it forms a bicyclic diene or something. But the product is a light yellow solid. Light yellow makes me think of an alkene, maybe something with conjugated double bonds, like a diene. Or maybe it's an epoxide, but no, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl group. Oh wait, 1720 is more like a ketone or ester. Or maybe an epoxide? No, epoxides have a different IR region, like around 1200-1250 for the C-O stretch. Wait, no, 1720 is more like a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, but KOH is a base. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an elimination, forming a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? No, because diols don't have 1720. Wait, perhaps it's a ketone formed via some kind of elimination and oxidation? Hmm, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe I'm thinking wrong here.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. KOH in high heat can cause eliminations, but sometimes it can also cause substitution. But with two bromines, substitution would be unlikely unless it's a very good leaving group and under specific conditions. But more likely, it's elimination.

Wait, the problem states that product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. Hmmm. So perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? But how?

Wait, alternative approach: maybe the reaction is not an elimination but a substitution. But with excess KOH, it's more likely elimination. Wait, unless it's a geminal dihalide, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't geminal. So maybe the elimination forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the 1720 cm-1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? No, because 1,3-dibromo wouldn't form a diketone via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl somewhere else. Oh wait! Maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening of some sort. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and maybe KOH is cleaving it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. Product 1's 1H NMR has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an oxygen-bearing proton, like an -OCH2- group or something. The 2.41-2.23 region is likely CH2 or CH groups in a more shielded environment. The 1.94 ppm is possibly another CH2 group. 

Wait, another thought: the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an epoxide. But epoxide protons typically show up around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group, but then the protons adjacent would be something else. Wait, the IR at 1720 would be a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. But where would the protons be?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But diols don't have a carbonyl. But wait, with KOH, maybe it's a substitution leading to two hydroxyl groups. But 1,3-diol would have certain NMR signals. But 4.79 could be OH groups, but those usually are broad. But the question says to exclude exchangeable protons, so maybe the 4.79 is something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH heating to 240Â°C. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? But that typically involves amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl via some mechanism. Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening via elimination. For example, in a cyclic structure, eliminating two HBr would form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But then, the product would have a double bond. But the IR doesn't show a peak in the alkene region (~1650 cm-1), but it shows a peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone.

Hmm, how would that happen? Maybe the elimination leads to a carbocation, which then loses a proton to form a double bond. But wait, that's not forming a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbonyl formation. Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination that forms a ketone. But I'm not quite sure.

Another approach: perhaps the product is adamantanone. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. If one of the bridgehead carbons loses a Br and a hydrogen, forming a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating both forms a conjugated diene? No, because that would not produce a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the KOH isn't just eliminating HBr but also doing something else. Wait, KOH can cause elimination, but also in some cases, it can promote ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, the product is a ketone because of some rearrangement. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, which is then oxidized? But KOH is not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet (2H). That could be adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether's CH2. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, maybe in a ring structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. So maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Or perhaps the product is a diether? But I don't see how KOH would form an ether.

Wait, another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Each Br is replaced by OH, forming 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction. But KOH isn't a Grignard reagent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Epoxide rings would have protons around 3-4 ppm. But 4.79 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but again, the IR doesn't match.

Wait, let me think of the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 for 2H. So what structure has a carbonyl and two protons near 4.79?

Maybe it's an enol ether. Enol ethers have a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, but their protons are usually in the 4-5 ppm range, perhaps. Or maybe an ester? Ester groups have carbonyls, but the adjacent protons are typically around 4 ppm.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH2- group. But then where is the ketone? For example, if you have an adamantane ring with a ketone group and an ether linkage.

Wait, maybe the product is a mono-oxide, like a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would have two carbonyls, and the IR would show maybe two peaks, but the question states a characteristic absorbance, implying one.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. But in that case, the NMR might show different signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl-containing compound like an ester or a ketone, but I'm not seeing the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps it's an aldoxide. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH in excess could lead to a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone because of the elimination of two HBr molecules. But how?

Wait, when two adjacent bromines are eliminated, they form a double bond. But for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. But as I thought earlier, bridgehead double bonds are generally not stable, but in adamantane they might be possible due to the structure's stability. So if they form a double bond, that would have an IR peak around 1650 cm-1. But the question says the IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product is a carbonyl because of a rearrangement. For example, after elimination of HBr, maybe a carbonyl is formed via some hydride shift or similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet (2H). That could be an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be a ring of CH2 groups, maybe adamantane's structure. Then the 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2.

Hmm, putting that together, maybe product 1 is a mono-substituted adamantane with an oxygen-containing group, like an ether or an ester.

Wait, if the product is a diol, but then the IR doesn't fit. So perhaps it's a mono-ether. But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, maybe the KOH isn't just doing elimination but also some kind of substitution. But substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but with two Brs, perhaps a double substitution occurs to form an oxide.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alkoxide, but that would be a transient species and not a solid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move on to the next part and see if that helps.

So product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, heating to form product 2. Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's an acylation. Wait, but product 1's structure isn't clear yet.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol. If product 1 is an alcohol, then product 2 could be an ether if it undergoes some alkylation.

Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is used more with Friedel-Crafts, which requires aromatic rings. But adamantane isn't aromatic. So maybe it's for some kind of alkylation or acylation on adamantane.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration step. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 could cause it to lose water and form an alkene. But then product 2 would be a diene, perhaps.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about product 3. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

The question is about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is the question.

So, if product 3 is a result of ozonolysis of a diene, perhaps it's a dialdehyde or a diketone. Alternatively, if the double bond was in a ring, ozonolysis could break the ring into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 has a single double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a monoene, leading to a single cleavage.

But the key is to figure out where the most deshielded proton is in product 3. The most deshielded would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and probably show a specific coupling pattern.

In ozonolysis, when a double bond is cleaved, each fragment's end would have a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would have groups attached to the carbonyls. For example, if the double bond was between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds, each with R groups.

But how does that help me determine the coupling pattern?

Wait, let's imagine that product 2 is a monoene, say a trans double bond in adamantane. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. Each would have a carbonyl group, and the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure. If the double bond is inside, maybe ozonolysis would create two ketone groups. For example, if the double bond is in a bridge, breaking it would create two bridgeheads with carbonyls.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination. Then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

So, the most deshielded proton would be on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-... or R-CO-CH(CH3)-...

Wait, but in any case, the coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded proton, say on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, would have neighboring protons. If the adjacent group has two protons, like a CH2, then each proton would couple with two others, possibly leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent group is a CH2, each of the two protons on the adjacent group would couple with the deshielded proton, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group itself is coupled with other groups, it could split further.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH group next to another CH2 group. Let's imagine a structure like:

O= C - CH2 - CH2 - something

In this case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two protons, each coupling with the next CH2 group. So the first CH2 (adjacent to carbonyl) would have two neighboring protons from each other and perhaps coupling with protons further down.

Wait, but maybe it's more like:

O= C - CH2 - CH2 - X

The CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's call them H1 and H2) each couple with each other (giving a triplet for each due to each other) and perhaps with H3 and H4 on the next CH2 group.

Hmm, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group that's adjacent to another group.

Wait, another angle: the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group that's next to a CH2 group which is next to a CH group. Then, each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet of triplets or something.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, which is it?

If the deshielded proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (which has two protons), then each of those protons would split the signal. So the deshielded proton would be a triplet (each proton sees two others, so n+1 = 3, triplet). But if those adjacent protons are themselves split by other groups, it could get more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the deshielded proton is next to a CH group that's adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, the splitting would involve coupling with both the CH and the CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So each proton in the CH2 group would see two neighboring protons (each other), leading to a triplet. But if there's another adjacent group, say another CH2, then each of those protons would couple with that as well, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton is probably adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R'. The CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say H1 and H2) each couple with each other (so each would cause a split into a triplet if only considering each other). But H1 and H2 are also adjacent to another CH2 group (H3 and H4), which each have two protons. So each H1 and H2 would also couple with H3 and H4. Wait, but each H1 would see H2 on the same CH2 (splitting into triplet) and H3 and H4 on the next CH2.

Wait, but if H1 is adjacent to H2 (on the same CH2) and H3 and H4 on the next CH2, then H1 would split into (n+1) where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So, H1 is next to H2 (which is two Hs?), wait, no, H2 is a single H on the same CH2 as H1. Wait, no, each CH2 has two Hs. So for H1, the neighboring Hs are H2 (on the same CH2) and H3 and H4 on the next CH2.

Wait, but H1 is on a CH2, adjacent to another CH2. So, for H1, the neighboring Hs would be H2 (same CH2: one neighbor, so n=1) and H3 and H4 (next CH2: n=2). So the total splitting would be (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 *3 = 6? So a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets?

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with adjacent groups. So H1 would couple with H2 (same CH2: one neighbor) and H3 and H4 (next CH2: two neighbors). So the splitting would be (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 *3 =6, so a triplet of triplets?

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about a simple example. Suppose I have a chain like CH2-CH2-CH2.

The middle CH2's protons would see the neighboring CH2s on both sides. Each neighboring CH2 has two protons. So, each proton in the middle would couple with two on the left and two on the right. But wait, each coupling is to adjacent protons. So for each proton in the middle, it would see two on the left and two on the right. But in reality, in ethylene glycol, each CH2 is split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a CH2-CH2-CH2 group. The central CH2's protons (let's say H3 and H4) would be next to H1 and H2 on the left and H5 and H6 on the right. So each H in the middle would couple with H1, H2, H5, H6? No, because protons couple with adjacent (vicinal) protons, not across the chain. Wait, no, vicinal coupling is between adjacent carbons, so in a chain like CH2-CH2-CH2, each CH2 is adjacent to the next, so the protons on the first CH2 couple with those on the second CH2 (J coupling about 6-7 Hz), and the second with the third.

So, in that case, for the middle CH2, each proton would see two protons on the left (from the first CH2) and two on the right (from the third CH2). So each proton in the middle would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks? That's a lot, but in reality, such a splitting is rare because the coupling constants may not be equal, leading to more complex multiplets.

But in the context of the problem, the most deshielded proton is probably on a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, which in turn is adjacent to a CH group. So, the deshielded proton (H1) would have two neighboring protons (H2 and H3) on the same CH2, and another set on the adjacent CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded proton is on a CH2 adjacent to a CH group. The CH group would have two protons, so each of them would split the signal of the CH2 proton.

So, the deshielded proton (H1) is on a CH2 next to a CH (which has two protons, H2 and H3). So H1 would couple with H2 and H3. Each coupling would split the signal. Since there are two different couplings (maybe the same J), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Or, if the J values are similar, it could be a doublet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if H1 is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group, then H1 would couple with two protons from the first adjacent group and two from the next. So, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a nonaet, which isn't an option. So perhaps it's a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but the answer options don't have a nonaet. So perhaps the coupling is only from one adjacent group. Let me reevaluate.

Another approach: ozonolysis of a double bond typically leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. Suppose the double bond was between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group.

So, structure after ozonolysis might be something like O=CH2-R and R'-CH2-CO=O (but that's an ester, not the case here). Alternatively, O=CH2-CH2-... etc.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with two carbonyl groups. For instance, in a simple case, a four-carbon diene would break into two two-carbon fragments, each a ketone if the diene was internal. So, for example, ozonolysis of butane-2,3-diene would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, maybe longer fragments.

But in the case of adamantane, if the double bond is in a bridge, the ozonolysis would break the bridge into two carbonyls, each attached to a bridgehead. So, for example, if the bridge had a double bond, ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups on each bridgehead.

In that case, the resulting molecule (product 3) would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to a carbon that's part of a bridge. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

So, imagine each bridgehead now has a carbonyl group. The adjacent carbons would have CH2 groups. So, the structure might have two carbonyls, each next to a CH2 group.

So, for each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded. Let's focus on one of them.

The CH2 group next to the carbonyl would have two protons. These protons would be vicinal to the carbonyl, so they might be split by neighboring groups.

If the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, which is perhaps in a ring, then each proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

So, for each proton on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, they would see two neighboring protons on the next CH2 group. So, each would split into a triplet.

But wait, if each of these protons is also coupled with another group, like a CH group, that could add more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH group. So, each proton on the CH2 would couple with the two protons on the CH group. Wait, but CH groups only have one proton each. So, each CH2 proton would couple with one proton on the adjacent CH group.

So, each of the two protons on the CH2 would be split by the single proton on the CH group. So, each would be a doublet. But since there are two equivalent protons on the CH2, the splitting would combine into a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet due to coupling with each other.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

If the deshielded proton is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to a CH group (which has one proton), then each proton on the CH2 would couple with the single proton on the CH.

So, each CH2 proton would have a doublet. But since there are two equivalent protons on the CH2, they would each see the same coupling. So, the splitting would be as follows: each proton on the CH2 is split into a doublet (coupled with the CH's proton). But since the two CH2 protons are equivalent, their splitting combines into a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH2 group, which is next to a CH group. Then, each CH2 proton would couple with the adjacent CH2 (two protons) and the CH (one proton). So, each would have (2+1)*(1+1) = 3*2=6, leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would be if each proton is coupled with two groups, each giving a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group. So, the CH proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each coupling would be a triplet (n=2, so triplet). But since the coupling is from two different groups, it could be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is adjacent to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. So, the CH proton would couple with the first CH2 (two protons) and the second CH2 (two protons). So, each triplet would split into triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, putting this all together, the most deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to two CH2 groups, each with two protons. So, each coupling would be a triplet, and the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, a light yellow solid product (product 1) is formed. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. The Â¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41â2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm signal suggests an -OCHâ- group, while the 2.41â2.23 ppm region corresponds to CHâ or CH groups in a shielded environment. The 1.94 ppm signal likely represents another CHâ group. Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely an ether or a carbonyl-containing compound.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions or dehydration. Given the structure of product 1, this step likely forms an alkene via dehydration, resulting in a conjugated diene or a single double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, producing carbonyl-containing compounds. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyl compounds. If product 2 is a monoene, ozonolysis would yield one carbonyl compound. The most deshielded proton in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby protons.

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton**:  
   The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely on a CH or CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton would couple with neighboring protons on adjacent groups. If the structure is such that the deshielded proton is adjacent to a CHâ group (with two protons) and another CHâ group (with two protons), the splitting pattern would be a triplet of triplets. This arises because the deshielded proton couples with two protons on one CHâ group (producing a triplet) and two protons on the next CHâ group (also producing a triplet), resulting in a total of nine peaks (triplet of triplets).

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton is **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
