Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, the speed of light isn't just simply added with the velocity of the medium because light has a special property—it always moves at speed c in a vacuum, regardless of the source's motion. But wait, this is in a glass medium, so the index of refraction comes into play.

The glass has an index of refraction n. When light travels through a medium, its speed is v = c/n. So normally, when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, the speed is c/n. But here, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light beam is also in that direction. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, I think I should consider the frame of reference. The observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So from the lab's point of view, we need to find the speed of the light beam.

I'm a bit rusty on relativity here. How do velocities add in relativity? I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light; however, the light's speed inside the glass is c/n. So the speed of the light in the glass's rest frame is c/n. So when the glass is moving, what's the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait, but light's speed is always c in any inertial frame. Oh, wait! No, that's only in a vacuum. Because in a medium, it's c/n. But I'm not sure. Wait, no—light's speed in a medium is v = c/n, but when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I think the key here is that the medium is moving, but the light's speed in the lab frame isn't just v_medium + v_light_medium. Because in relativity, you can't just add velocities like that. So perhaps we should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The speed of light in the moving medium (glass) is still not more than c. So the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the glass is c/n. So from the lab's frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, maybe it's better to model it as the glass is moving at v. Inside the glass, the light propagates at c/n. So the observer in the lab would see the light moving at a speed that's a combination of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity inside the glass.

In classical mechanics, you'd just add the velocities: v_light_lab = v_glass + v_light_glass. But in relativity, that's not the case. So the correct way is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

In this case, u is the speed of light inside the glass, which is c/n. And the medium is moving at v, same direction. So substituting into the formula:

u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n * v)/c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c)

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Denominator: 1 + (u v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)).

So denominator becomes (n c + v) / (n c) ) if I factor out 1/(n c):

Wait, 1 is (n c)/(n c). So 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:

u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

The (c + n v) terms in numerator and denominator (n c + v) — Wait, let's see:

Wait, n c + v is the same as v + n c, which is same as n c + v. So in the denominator, we have (n c + v). The numerator is (c + n v) which is the same as n v + c.

Wait, wait, let's think about the numerator: (c + n v) and denominator (n c + v). Are these the same?

Wait, no. For example, if n=1, then numerator is c + v and denominator is c + v. So they would cancel. But if n is different, it's not the same. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recast the expression:

u' = [ (c + n v) / (n) ) ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

So the n in the denominator cancels with the n in the numerator of the second fraction.

So now u' = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v)

Which is [ c(c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let's factor out c in the denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor the denominator as v + n c. So same as earlier.

Wait, but let's think about the numerator: c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: n c + v.

So u' = [ c^2 + c n v ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, I can factor c from numerator and denominator:

u' = c (c + n v) / ( c (n) + v )

Wait, not sure. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor v out of denominator.

Wait, denominator: v (n c / v + 1 )

Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the expression can't be simplified much. But the options given are fractions.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 1. That would be if somehow the speed is c, but that's only in vacuum when medium is stationary. But glass is moving. So option B is probably not correct.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v). Hmm, but if I take our expression [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v), and factor c from numerator and denominator:

u' = c [ (c + n v) ] / [ c (n) + v ]

Wait, let's see if I can write it as [ c (c + n v) ] / (c (n) + v )

If I factor c from denominator: c (n + v/(c)) )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the way I approached is wrong. Maybe the correct approach is to consider the speed of light in the medium when the medium is moving. I've heard of the concept of "medium moving with velocity v", but how does it affect the light's speed.

Wait, another approach: The speed of light in a medium is c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. Because the index of refraction is a property of the medium. So even if the medium is moving, the light's speed in that medium is still c/n. So from the lab's frame, which is an inertial frame, the speed of light would still be c/n.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the thought about relativistic velocity addition. Because in a different frame, velocities add.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is not affected by the motion of the medium. Because the speed of light in a medium (like glass) is c/n, which is a property intrinsic to the medium, regardless of where it's placed or how it's moving.

So in the lab frame, the light is moving at c/n, irrespective of the glass's velocity. So the answer should be c/n. But wait, the speed of light in vacuum is c, but here it's in glass, so it's c/n.

Wait, but the options don't have c/n. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)

B) 1

C) (1 + n v)/(n - v)

D) (1 - n v)/(n + v)

Hmm, none of these look like c/n. Wait, but c is given as 1 in the problem. So if c=1, then the speed is 1/n.

But none of the options directly present 1/n. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The glass is moving, but the light is in the same direction as the glass's velocity and towards the observer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as the medium moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion. So, from the lab frame, the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So the light's velocity as observed in the lab is the sum, but with relativistic correction.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the medium is still c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. That is, the speed is determined by the medium's properties, so the lab would measure the speed as c/n.

But wait, what if the medium is moving? Let's think of a simple example. Suppose the medium is stationary: speed is c/n. If the medium moves towards the observer, the speed of light according to the observer would be (c/n + v) / (1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) ) = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Wait, but that's the same as earlier. So perhaps the observed speed is (c/n + v) divided by (1 + (v)/(n c)), which simplifies to [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ] = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v) * (1/n) ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Let me try to plug in some numbers to test.

Suppose n = 1, which means it's a medium with index 1, like air (approx). And v = 0, so the medium is stationary. Then the speed should be c/n = 1 (since c=1). Which option gives 1 when v=0 and n=1?

Option A: (1 + 1 * 0)/(1+0) = 1/1 = 1. Correct.

Option B: 1. Correct.

Wait, both options A and B give 1 when v=0.

Another test case: if the medium is moving at velocity v = 0.5, and n=1. Then the speed of light in the medium is 1. What would be the observed speed? Using the relativistic formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Here, u is the speed in the medium's frame, which is 1. So u' = (1 + 0.5)/(1 + (1 * 0.5)/1 ) = 1.5 / (1.5) = 1.

Wait, that's the same as before. So in this case, the observed speed is still 1, which is same as the speed of light in the medium, because the medium's motion doesn't affect the speed of light.

Wait, but that's because when n=1, the speed is c. So light in a vacuum moving at speed v would have its speed measured as c, which doesn't change. So perhaps when n=1, the speed of light in the lab frame is still c, regardless of the medium's motion.

But in our problem, the medium is glass with n>1. Let's take n=2 and v=0. So the speed should be 0.5. Looking at the options when n=2, v=0:

Option A: (1+0)/(2+0)= 1/2=0.5. Correct.

Option B: 1. Incorrect, because speed is 0.5.

So, when v=0, option A gives the correct speed. So option A must be correct, but wait in this case, when the medium is moving, how does it affect the speed?

Wait, another test: n=2, v=0.5. Let's compute.

Using the velocity addition formula:

u_medium = c/n = 1/2.

u' = (u_medium + v) / (1 + (u_medium * v)/c² )

Plug in the numbers: (0.5 + 0.5) / (1 + (0.5 * 0.5)/1 )

= 1 / (1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8.

Now, compute option A: (1 + n*v)/(n +v) = (1 +2*0.5)/(2+0.5) = (1+1)/(2.5) = 2/2.5 = 0.8. Correct.

So for n=2, v=0.5, the correct answer is 0.8, which matches option A.

Wait, so in that case, option A gives the correct result when using the relativistic velocity addition.

Hence, the correct formula is option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we must account for relativistic effects. The speed of light in the glass is \( c/n \) in the rest frame of the glass, where \( n \) is the index of refraction. When the glass is moving, the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u = c/n \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}}
\]

Canceling the common factor of \( n \) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{c + n v}{n c + v}
\]

Factoring \( c \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{c(1) + n v}{c(n) + v}
\]

This matches the form of option A, which is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

To verify, consider the following test cases:

1. **When \( v = 0 \):** The speed of light in the glass is \( c/n \). Substituting \( v = 0 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + 0}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.

2. **When \( n = 1 \) (vacuum):** The speed of light is always \( c \), regardless of the medium's motion. Substituting \( n = 1 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which is correct.

3. **When \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \):** Using the relativistic formula, the observed speed is \( u' = 0.8 \). Substituting \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + 2(0.5)}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Denominator: 1 + (u v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)).

So denominator becomes (n c + v) / (n c) ) if I factor out 1/(n c):

Wait, 1 is (n c)/(n c). So 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:

u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

The (c + n v) terms in numerator and denominator (n c + v) — Wait, let's see:

Wait, n c + v is the same as v + n c, which is same as n c + v. So in the denominator, we have (n c + v). The numerator is (c + n v) which is the same as n v + c.

Wait, wait, let's think about the numerator: (c + n v) and denominator (n c + v). Are these the same?

Which is [ c(c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor the denominator as v + n c. So same as earlier.

Wait, but let's think about the numerator: c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

So u' = [ c^2 + c n v ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, I can factor c from numerator and denominator:

Wait, but that's the same as earlier. So perhaps the observed speed is (c/n + v) divided by (1 + (v)/(n c)), which simplifies to [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ] = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v) * (1/n) ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Let me try to plug in some numbers to test.

Suppose n = 1, which means it's a medium with index 1, like air (approx). And v = 0, so the medium is stationary. Then the speed should be c/n = 1 (since c=1). Which option gives 1 when v=0 and n=1?

Option A: (1 + 1 * 0)/(1+0) = 1/1 = 1. Correct.

Option B: 1. Correct.

Wait, both options A and B give 1 when v=0.

Another test case: if the medium is moving at velocity v = 0.5, and n=1. Then the speed of light in the medium is 1. What would be the observed speed? Using the relativistic formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Here, u is the speed in the medium's frame, which is 1. So u' = (1 + 0.5)/(1 + (1 * 0.5)/1 ) = 1.5 / (1.5) = 1.

Wait, that's the same as before. So in this case, the observed speed is still 1, which is same as the speed of light in the medium, because the medium's motion doesn't affect the speed of light.

Wait, but that's because when n=1, the speed is c. So light in a vacuum moving at speed v would have its speed measured as c, which doesn't change. So perhaps when n=1, the speed of light in the lab frame is still c, regardless of the medium's motion.

But in our problem, the medium is glass with n>1. Let's take n=2 and v=0. So the speed should be 0.5. Looking at the options when n=2, v=0:

Option A: (1+0)/(2+0)= 1/2=0.5. Correct.

Option B: 1. Incorrect, because speed is 0.5.

So, when v=0, option A gives the correct speed. So option A must be correct, but wait in this case, when the medium is moving, how does it affect the speed?

Wait, another test: n=2, v=0.5. Let's compute.

Using the velocity addition formula:

u_medium = c/n = 1/2.

u' = (u_medium + v) / (1 + (u_medium * v)/c² )

Plug in the numbers: (0.5 + 0.5) / (1 + (0.5 * 0.5)/1 )

= 1 / (1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8.

Now, compute option A: (1 + n*v)/(n +v) = (1 +2*0.5)/(2+0.5) = (1+1)/(2.5) = 2/2.5 = 0.8. Correct.

So for n=2, v=0.5, the correct answer is 0.8, which matches option A.

Wait, so in that case, option A gives the correct result when using the relativistic velocity addition.

Hence, the correct formula is option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we must account for relativistic effects. The speed of light in the glass is \( c/n \) in the rest frame of the glass, where \( n \) is the index of refraction. When the glass is moving, the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u = c/n \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}}
\]

Canceling the common factor of \( n \) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{c + n v}{n c + v}
\]

Factoring \( c \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{c(1) + n v}{c(n) + v}
\]

This matches the form of option A, which is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}

To verify, consider the following test cases:

1. **When \( v = 0 \):** The speed of light in the glass is \( c/n \). Substituting \( v = 0 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + 0}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.

2. **When \( n = 1 \) (vacuum):** The speed of light is always \( c \), regardless of the medium's motion. Substituting \( n = 1 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which is correct.

3. **When \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \):** Using the relativistic formula, the observed speed is \( u' = 0.8 \). Substituting \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + 2(0.5)}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
