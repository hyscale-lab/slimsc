Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a potential. Hmm, I remember from my notes that this is a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator problem. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², right? So, the potential is isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions. 

The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. Oh wait, I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator depend on the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, so for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But another way to write it is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh, right, because each direction contributes n_i terms.

So the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. Each quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the possible n values are 0,1,2,... which correspond to different energy levels.

Now, the question says, the third excited state. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy, which would be the state with n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0). The first excited state is n=1, the second is n=2, and the third is n=3. Wait no, wait. Because each increment in n corresponds to a higher energy level. So the ground state is n=0 (E=(3/2)ħω), first excited n=1 (E=(5/2)ħω), second excited n=2 (E=(7/2)ħω), third excited is n=3 (E=(9/2)ħω. So the energy should be (9/2) ħω, which is option A or C.

Now, the other part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. That's the degeneracy of the level. The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic oscillator is (n +1)(n +2)/2. Or wait, another formula I think is (n + 2)(n +1)/2. Or maybe it's (n +1)(n +2)/2? Let me think. For each n, the number of ways to write n = n_x + n_y + n_z where each n_i >=0. 

That's a combinatorial problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n is (n+3-1 choose 3-1) ) = (n+2 choose 2) ) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, it's (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. Oh wait, so the degeneracy is 10.

So looking at the options, option A says (9/2)ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says same energy but only 3 eigenfunctions. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, what about the other options? Let me check. Option B has an energy expression with pi squared and 1/m r², which doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because ħ has units of J·s, m in kg, ω is 1/s. So (1/2 m ω² r²) is energy, which matches. The other options' energies don't seem to fit the standard form. So options B and D can be eliminated because their energy expressions don't match the harmonic oscillator form.

So the correct answer should be A: (9/2) ħω, 10 eigenfunctions.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The total quantum number is $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and the energy can also be expressed as $E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$.

The third excited state corresponds to $n = 3$, as the ground state is $n = 0$, the first excited state is $n = 1$, the second excited state is $n = 2$, and the third excited state is $n = 3$. Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to distribute the quantum number $n$ among the three dimensions, which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

For $n = 3$, the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Analyzing the options:
- Option A: $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, 10 eigenfunctions — Correct.
- Option B: The energy expression is dimensionally inconsistent with the harmonic oscillator potential.
- Option C: $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, but only 3 eigenfunctions — Incorrect, as the degeneracy is 10, not 3.
- Option D: The energy expression is dimensionally inconsistent, and the degeneracy is incorrectly stated as 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
