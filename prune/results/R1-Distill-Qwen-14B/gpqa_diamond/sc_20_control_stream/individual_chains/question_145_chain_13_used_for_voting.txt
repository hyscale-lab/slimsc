Alright, I've got this chemistry problem here about stereoisomers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Okay, let's break that down. First, the structure. Undeca means 11 carbons. So the main chain is 11 carbons long. Let me try to sketch this out mentally.

The double bonds are at positions 3 and 7, so that's undeca-3,7-diene. So the structure would have double bonds between C3-C4 and C7-C8. Then, at position 5, there's an alcohol group (-OH). Also, methyl groups are at position 2, and a chlorine at position 6, and an ethyl group at position 9.

Wait, so the substituents are at positions 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), and 9 (ethyl). Now, the question is about stereoisomers. So stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers, which arise from stereogenic centers (chirality) or geometric isomerism (cis-trans).

Let me look for stereogenic centers. A stereogenic center is a carbon with four different groups attached.

Looking at the compound: the alcohol is at C5. Let's see what's attached to C5. It's connected to C4, C6, an OH group, and another H or substituent? Wait, the main chain is 11 carbons, so the positions are 1 to 11.

Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Let's imagine the structure. The main chain is 11 carbons. So the positions for substituents are 2,5,6,9.

At C2: a methyl group. That's a -CH2CH(CH3)- part. Wait no, maybe that's branching. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The main chain is undecane with double bonds at 3,7 and substituents at 2,5,6,9.

So for each substituent, I need to check if it's on a stereogenic center.

First, the OH group is at C5. Let's look at that carbon. What are the four groups attached to C5?

C5 is connected to C4, which is part of the double bond (so C4 is double-bonded to C3), and C6, which is a Cl. So C5 must be connected to:

- C4 (double bond, so maybe a double bond affects the structure)
Wait, wait, if C5 is part of a double bond, no. Wait, the double bonds are at 3,7. So C3 is connected to C4 via a double bond, and C7 is connected to C8 via a double bond. So C5 is somewhere in the middle.

Wait, maybe I should write the structure:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

So, substituents at 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), 9 (ethyl).

So the structure would be:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11
CH2CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)Cl-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, no, because the double bonds are at 3,7. So maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure it correctly.

The formula is undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. So the main chain is 11 carbons with double bonds at 3 and 7.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8.

So let me imagine:

Positions 1 to 11, with double bonds between 3-4 and 7-8.

So:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH2- (but wait, no, double bond starts at 3, so position 3 is double bonded to 4.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write it as:

Positions:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C= (double bond to 4)

4: C= (double bond to 3)

5: CH(OH)-

6: Cl attached here?

Wait, the substituents are at 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), 9 (ethyl).

So let's write the structure:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2- (but wait, no, 3 is part of the double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire structure. Let me try to build it step by step.

The main chain is 11 carbons, with double bonds at 3 and 7.

So the structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11

Each number is a carbon.

At 3 and 4: double bond (3,4 double bond)
At 7 and 8: double bond (7,8 double bond)

Then, substituents:

At 2: methyl (CH(CH3))
At 5: OH (CH(OH))
At 6: Cl (maybe Cl attached to C6)
At 9: ethyl (CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3) ?)

Wait, wait, perhaps another approach: the substituents are at positions 2,5,6,9.

So:

Carbon 2: has a methyl group attached.

Carbon 5: has an OH group.

Carbon 6: has Cl.

Carbon 9: has an ethyl group.

Now, for each of these, I need to see if each substituent is on a chiral center.

A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents.

Let me check each carbon:

Carbon 2: The structure is CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3.

Wait, C2 is connected to:

- C1 (which is a CH3 group)
- C3 (which is part of a double bond)
- CH3 (methyl)
- What else? Hmm, wait, the double bond at 3,4 means C3 is double bonded to C4, so it's not a chiral center because it's double bonded; it can't have four substituents.

Wait, let me think about each carbon.

Carbon 2:

Carbons attached to C2: C1, C3, and two substituents?

Wait, no. Let me think: the main chain is 11 carbons, with substituents.

At C2, it's a substituent (methyl). So the structure is:

C1 - C2(CH(CH3)) - C3 = C4 - ... and so on.

So C2 has the following substituents:

- C1 (which is CH2CH3 if we go back, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, C2 is attached to C1, which is CH2CH3 (if it's the start), but wait, the first carbon is CH3, then CH2, then C2 with a methyl.

Hmm, perhaps the structure at C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 and C3.

So C2: substituents are:

- C1 (which is CH2-)
- C3 (which is part of a double bond, so a CH2- group)
- CH3 (the methyl)
- Another substituent?

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure from the double bonds.

The main chain is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CHCl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that doesn't include the double bonds. Wait, the double bonds are at 3,4 and 7,8.

Oh, right! So the main chain has double bonds at 3,4 and 7,8. So the structure would be:

Positions 1-11:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH2- (but wait, 3 is double bonded to 4)

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

The main chain is 11 carbons long. The substituents are at 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), and 9 (ethyl).

The double bonds are at 3,4 and 7,8.

So, the structure could be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-Cl-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to structure it properly.

At position 3, a double bond starts. So the structure would be:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C= (double bond to C4)

4: C= (double bond to C3)

5: CH(OH)-

6: Cl attached here?

Wait, no, position 6 is Cl.

Wait, maybe the chain is:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: C= (double bond to C4)

4: C= (double bond to C3)

5: CH(OH)-

6: Cl

7: C= (double bond to C8)

8: C= (double bond to C7)

9: CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-

10: CH2-

11: CH3

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the main chain as follows.

But wait, the substituents at 6 (Cl) and 9 (ethyl) are on the main chain, so they are in the positions as per the numbering.

Now, focusing back on stereoisomers. So I need to find all the possible stereogenic centers in the molecule.

Each stereogenic center contributes a factor of 2 to the total number of stereoisomers. So if there are n stereogenic centers, the number is 2^n.

Also, I must consider if there are any geometric isomerism (cis-trans) due to double bonds, but wait, geometric isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism, but in this case, the double bonds are in fixed positions. So each double bond can have cis or trans configurations. So they contribute as well.

Wait, but wait. The question is about stereoisomers, which includes geometric isomerism. So I have to account for both the stereogenic centers and the double bonds' configurations.

Wait, but the molecule has two double bonds. Each double bond can be cis or trans, so that's 2^2=4 possibilities from the double bonds.

But I also need to check if the molecule has any stereogenic centers (chiral centers) beyond that.

So first, let's count the possible stereogenic centers.

Looking at each carbon:

Carbon 2: substituents are CH3 (from methyl), CH2 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), and what else? Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (CH2), C3 (CH2), and has a methyl group (CH(CH3)), so the groups are:

- CH2 (C1)
- CH2 (C3)
- CH3 (methyl)
- and another CH2? Or perhaps not. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each carbon in the structure.

Let me try again. The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

So, the main chain is 11 carbons with double bonds at 3 and 7.

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2 (but wait, no, because it's part of a double bond. So C3 is double bonded to C4.

So, Carbon 3 is CH2 (since it's double bonded, so maybe it's a double bond between C3 and C4, making them each CH2 groups with the double bond.

Wait, that might not be right. For a double bond, each carbon is bonded with two substituents and the double bond.

So, C3: structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 etc., but with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2=CH-

Wait, no, because the double bond is at 3,4, so that would be CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2- etc.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should think about the substituents and their positions.

The substituents:

At C2: methyl (CH(CH3)).

At C5: OH.

At C6: Cl.

At C9: ethyl (CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)).

So, the main chain is 11 carbons, with substituents at 2,5,6,9.

Now, let's check each carbon for possible chirality.

Chiral centers must have four distinct groups attached.

So, looking at C2: substituents are:

- C1 (which is CH2-)
- C3 (which is part of a double bond, so what's attached to C3? It's connected to C4 via a double bond, so perhaps C3 is CH2- on one side and CH2- on the other?

Wait, I think I'm not visualizing this correctly. Maybe I should focus on the substituents.

Carbon 2: attached to C1 (CH2), C3 (CH2), and a methyl group (CH(CH3)).

Wait, but that's only three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So carbon 2 must have four substituents.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the substituent at C2 is a methyl group. So the structure at C2 is CH(CH3). Then, what are the four groups attached to C2?

- One methyl (CH3)
- One bond to C1 (which is CH2-)
- One bond to C3 (which is CH2-)
- And a fourth group... wait, perhaps a hydrogen? No, because if it's CH(CH3), it's connected to CH3, C1, C3, and another group. But wait, in reality, the substituent is a methyl group, so perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)CH2..., meaning that C2 is connected to C1, C3, a methyl group, and a hydrogen?

Wait, that can't be. The main chain is 11 carbons, so C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So if it's CH(CH3), then it has a CH3 as one substituent, and two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and a hydrogen. So four substituents: CH3, two CH2 groups, and H.

Wait, but two CH2 groups are same? Then C2 would not be a chiral center because two substituents are same.

So C2 has groups: CH3, CH2 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), and H. But if the two CH2 groups are same, then two substituents are same, making it not a chiral center.

So C2 is not a chiral center.

Next, C5: it's an alcohol group, OH.

The substituents on C5 are:

- C4 (which is part of a double bond, perhaps CH2)
- C6 (which is Cl)
- OH
- And what else?

Wait, C5 is between C4 and C6. So the groups attached to C5 would be:

- CH2 (from C4, which is part of a double bond)
- Cl (from C6)
- OH
- And another CH2 group? Or something else.

Wait, maybe the structure at C5 is CH(OH)ClCH2...?

No, wait. Let me try to think of C5 as being connected to C4, C6, H, and OH. But wait, if C4 is part of a double bond, it can't have a single bond to C5. Alternatively, the double bonds are at 3,4 and 7,8, so C4 is double bonded to C3 and single bonded to C5.

So C4 would be CH2 (since it's double bonded to C3, which is part of the double bond. So C4 would be CH2 connected to C5.

So C5 is connected to:

- C4 (CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- And another substituent, perhaps another CH2 group or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me try to list the substituents at each carbon.

At C5:

- One bond to C4 (which is CH2-)
- One bond to C6 (which is Cl)
- OH group
- And another bond to what? Maybe a hydrogen or another substituent.

If the groups on C5 are CH2 (from C4), Cl (from C6), OH, and another CH2 (from the other side), then C5 would have two CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center. But wait, perhaps the substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps C5 is connected to C4 (CH2), C6 (Cl), an OH, and another CH2 group. If the CH2 groups are the same, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are all different, then it is.

Wait, if the substituents are:

- C4: CH2 (from the double bond)
- C6: Cl
- OH
- And another group, maybe a CH2CH2... ?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The main chain is 11 carbons, with substituents at 2,5,6,9.

At C5, the substituents would be:

- C4 (CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- And another substituent. What's that?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's without the double bonds. But the molecule has double bonds at 3,4 and 7,8.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH(OH)-Cl-CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Hmm, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should think that the substituents at 5,6, etc., are on the main chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has the structure:

Positions 3-4: double bond.

Positions 7-8: double bond.

At position 2: a methyl branch.

At position 5: OH.

At position 6: Cl.

At position 9: ethyl branch.

Wait, maybe I can represent the structure like this:

1    2       3       4   5   6   7       8   9        10   11
CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2=CH-CH(OH)Cl-CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, but that might not fit. Maybe the substituents are arranged differently.

But regardless, let's check for each possible stereogenic center.

C5: substituents are:

- C4 (CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- And perhaps another substituent, maybe a CH2 group or another group. If all four are different, then C5 is a stereogenic center.

Wait, if C5 is connected to:

- CH2 (C4)
- Cl (C6)
- OH
- And another group, say CH2-CH2 etc., then perhaps all substituents are different.

Wait, but wait: if C5 is CH(OH)ClCH2..., then the groups are:

- C4 (CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- And another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group.

If C5 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: the substituents on C5 would be:

- One side: double bond (since C4 is part of a double bond)
Wait, no, C4 is connected via a single bond to C5, because the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, C4 is CH2, connected to C5.

So C5's substituents are:

- C4 (CH2)
- Cl (attached to C6)
- OH
- And another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group leading to C6.

Wait, that might be the same as the C4 group. So if C5 is connected to two CH2 groups, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on and see if there are other stereogenic centers.

C6: substituents are Cl, and what else?

C6 is connected to C5 (maybe a CH(OH) group), C7 (which is part of a double bond), and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, but since C6 has Cl, and is connected to C5 and C7, and what else?

If C6 is Cl attached to a carbon connected to C5, C7, and another group, maybe a hydrogen.

So substituents on C6:

- C5 (maybe CH(OH))
- C7 (which is double bonded, so perhaps CH2)
- Cl
- H (if any)

If all four substituents are different, then C6 is a chiral center.

Alternatively, if two substituents are same, then it's not.

Wait, but the substituent at C6 is Cl, which is a different group. So, let's say C6 has:

- C5 (CH(OH)Cl)
- C7 (CH2)
- Cl
- H (if any)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of each substituent.

At C6, the substituents would be:

- C5 (which is CH(OH))
- C7 (which is part of a double bond, so maybe CH2)
- Cl
- And another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, if C6 has substituents CH(OH), CH2, Cl, and another CH2, then two substituents are same (CH2), so C6 is not a chiral center.

So, perhaps C6 is not a stereogenic center.

Next, C9: substituent is ethyl.

So C9 would have:

- C8 (which is part of a double bond)
- C10 (CH2)
- Ethyl group (CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3))
- And another substituent.

Wait, if C9 is connected to C8 (double bond), perhaps that's a CH2 group, and then C10 is CH2.

So substituents on C9 are:

- C8 (CH2, since it's double bonded)
- C10 (CH2)
- Ethyl (CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3))
- And another substituent, maybe a hydrogen.

Wait, that would mean substituents are CH2 (from C8), CH2 (from C10), ethyl, and H. So two CH2 groups, making substituents not all different. Hence, not a chiral center.

So, so far, which carbons could be chiral centers? Let's see:

C2: Not chiral (two CH2 groups)
C5: Maybe not, but I'm not entirely sure.
C6: Not chiral.
C9: Not chiral.

Wait, but maybe I missed something. Are there any other carbons that could be chiral centers?

Let me check C7 and C8. Wait, double bonds are at 7,8, so those are double bonded carbons. They can't be chiral centers because they are sp² hybridized and have only three substituents (each is part of a double bond and connected to two other carbons).

So, perhaps the only possible chiral center is C5.

Wait, but let's go back to C5. Suppose the substituents are:

- C4: CH2 (from the main chain)
- C6: Cl (attached)
- OH
- And another substituent, perhaps a methyl group, but no, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps C5 is connected to:

- C4: CH2
- C6: Cl
- OH
- And another CH2 group leading to C6.

Wait, if that's the case, then the substituents are CH2 (C4), Cl (C6), OH, and another CH2 (C6's side). So two CH2 groups would make it not a chiral center.

Hmm, so maybe there are no stereogenic centers in this molecule. But that can't be right because the question is about stereoisomers, which implies there are some.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think. Are there any other substituents that could create a chiral center?

Wait, what about the double bonds? Could they contribute to geometric isomerism, which would add to the number of stereoisomers.

Because each double bond can be cis or trans, so two double bonds would contribute 2^2 =4 possibilities.

Additionally, if there are any chiral centers, each contributes a factor of 2.

Wait, but if there are no chiral centers, then the only stereoisomers would come from the double bonds.

So, let's count.

Each double bond has two possibilities (cis or trans), so two double bonds give 2^2=4 possibilities.

If there are no chiral centers, the total would be 4 stereoisomers.

But wait, the options are A)4, B)16, C)32, D)8.

So, if the answer is 4, option A would be correct.

But I'm not entirely certain because I might have missed a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps C5 is a chiral center. Let me think again.

At C5, if the substituents are:

- C4: CH2 (from the main chain)
- C6: Cl (attached)
- OH
- And another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group.

But wait, maybe the substituents are:

- C4: CH2
- C6: Cl
- OH
- And perhaps a CH2 group leading to C5 from another direction.

Wait, if C5 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Wait, what if the substituents are:

- C4 (CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- and a CH2 group from another branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are all different. So, four different groups. For example:

- CH2 (from C4)
- Cl (from C6)
- OH
- and another CH2 group (from the other side, perhaps C6's side?)

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2 (C4)
- Cl
- OH
- and a CH2CH2... group leading to C6.

In that case, the substituents would be:

- CH2 (C4)
- Cl
- OH
- CH2-CH2... (which could be different from the CH2 from C4)

If all four are different, then it's a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps C5 is connected to:

- C4 (which is CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- And a hydrogen. But wait, then the groups would be CH2, Cl, OH, H. That's four different groups, so yes, it's a chiral center.

Wait, if C5 is CH(OH)Cl connected to C4 (CH2), C6 (Cl), and a hydrogen. No, wait, because if C5 is connected to C6, which has Cl, then C5 would have Cl as a substituent. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps C5 is connected to C4 (CH2), C6 (Cl), OH, and another substituent that's not a CH2 group.

If that's the case, then C5 would be a chiral center, adding another factor of 2.

So, if there's one chiral center and two double bonds with cis/trans possibilities, the total number of stereoisomers would be 2^3 =8.

But wait, that would give 8 stereoisomers. So the total would be 2^ (number of double bonds + number of chiral centers).

Wait, but no, the double bonds contribute 2^2=4, and a single chiral center contributes 2, so total 4*2=8.

Wait, but the options have D)8.

Hmm, but earlier I thought there were no chiral centers, leading to 4 stereoisomers.

But if there's one chiral center, it's 8.

So, I'm a bit confused.

Let me try to think again.

If C5 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. So, substituents would be:

- CH2 from C4 (since C4 is CH2 connected to C5)
- Cl from C6
- OH
- And another group, which could be a CH2 leading to C6.

Wait, but if the substituents are CH2 (C4), Cl, OH, and CH2 (C6), then two substituents are same (CH2 groups), so not a chiral center.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- C4 (CH2)
- C6 (Cl)
- OH
- And a hydrogen.

In that case, substituents are CH2, Cl, OH, H. All four are different. So, yes, C5 is a chiral center.

That would mean one chiral center.

So, number of stereoisomers would be from the double bonds (4) multiplied by the chiral centers (2), so 4*2=8, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me recheck.

If C5 has four different substituents, then it is chiral. So substituents are:

- Group 1: the chain towards C4 (CH2)
- Group 2: the chain towards C6 (Cl)
- Group 3: OH
- Group 4: H.

Yes, that makes four different groups. So C5 is a chiral center.

So, in that case, the molecule has one chiral center and two double bonds.

Each double bond can be cis or trans, so 2^2=4 possibilities.

The chiral center adds 2 possibilities.

So, total stereoisomers = 4 * 2 =8.

So, the answer would be D)8.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol, we analyze the molecule for both chiral centers and geometric isomerism due to the double bonds.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structure of the Molecule**:  
   The compound has a 11-carbon main chain with double bonds at positions 3 and 7, and substituents at positions 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), and 9 (ethyl).

2. **Chiral Centers**:  
   A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups.  
   - **C2**: Substituents are CH3, CH2 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), and H. Since two substituents (CH2 groups) are identical, C2 is not a chiral center.  
   - **C5**: Substituents are CH2 (from C4), Cl (from C6), OH, and H. All four substituents are distinct, making C5 a chiral center.  
   - **C6**: Substituents are CH2 (from C5), CH2 (from C7), Cl, and H. Since two substituents (CH2 groups) are identical, C6 is not a chiral center.  
   - **C9**: Substituents are CH2 (from C8), CH2 (from C10), CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl group), and H. Since two substituents (CH2 groups) are identical, C9 is not a chiral center.  

   Thus, there is **1 chiral center** in the molecule.

3. **Geometric Isomerism (Cis-Trans)**:  
   The molecule has two double bonds at positions 3,4 and 7,8. Each double bond can exist in either a cis or trans configuration. Therefore, the double bonds contribute \(2^2 = 4\) geometric isomers.

### Total Number of Stereoisomers:  
The total number of stereoisomers is calculated by combining the contributions from the chiral center and the double bonds:  
\[
\text{Total Stereoisomers} = 2^{\text{(number of chiral centers)}} \times 2^{\text{(number of double bonds)}} = 2^1 \times 2^2 = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

### Conclusion:  
The compound has 8 stereoisomers in total.
