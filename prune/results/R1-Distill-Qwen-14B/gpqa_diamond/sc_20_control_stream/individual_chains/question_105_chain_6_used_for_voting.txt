Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and how they affect the brightness variation of a star, which could mimic an exoplanet's transit. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a star with a radius equal to the Sun's has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot's temperature must be 5000 K, right?

The question is about photometric observations showing brightness variations due to the star's rotation. This is because as the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of our view, the observed brightness changes. But the twist is that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve.

Wait, the problem states that without the spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same brightness variation. Oh, okay. So I need to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the change in brightness (ΔF) is given by the area of the planet divided by the area of the star. Because the planet blocks some of the star's light. The formula is ΔF = (Rp / Rstar)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star.

But in this case, the dark spots are causing a dip in brightness as the spotted area rotates into view. Wait, no, the spots are darker, so when they are on the side facing us, they would make the star appear slightly dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a periodic dip in brightness. So the amplitude of this dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, I think the key here is to calculate the fractional change in flux due to the spots and compare that to the change caused by a planet.

The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area times the temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So the total flux from the star (F_total) would be the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the unspotted area.

Let me think, the star's total flux without spots would be F0 = 4πR² * σ T_eff^4. But with spots, the flux is F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

The unspotted area is most of the star's surface, but in this case, the spots are on one hemisphere. So the total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR², and 20% of that is the spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

The flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere would be the area (2πR² minus 0.2*2πR²) times the T_eff^4. The spotted area is 0.4π R² times (T_spot)^4.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The star's total flux is calculated based on whether each part is emitting at the star's temperature or the spot's temperature. So the entire star's surface is emitting, but some parts are cooler.

Let me model this. The star's total flux is the sum over all surface elements. The unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions (which are 20% of one hemisphere) are at 5000 K.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the total flux when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is the one coming into view would be F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

Wait, but the star's entire surface may not be equally visible as it rotates. Hmm, perhaps the star is being observed such that one hemisphere is fully rotated into view, and the other is not. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty. When it's not, we see the other hemisphere, which is unspotty. So the variation is between F_spotty and F_unspotty.

But wait, in reality, the star's rotation would cause the spotted area to come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness occurs when the spotty hemisphere is not visible (so the unspotted side is facing us), and the minimum when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no, because the spots are darker, when they're in view, the flux drops. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty.

Wait, but the star's entire surface is emitting. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotty area and the unspotty area on the near side.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as being divided into two hemispheres: one hemisphere (A) is spotted with 20% coverage, and the other (B) is entirely unspotted. The observed flux will vary as the star rotates, bringing A and B into view.

So when the unspotted hemisphere (B) is facing us, the flux is F_B = area of hemisphere * σ T^4. Because hemisphere B's area is 2π R², and all of it is at 6000 K.

When the spotted hemisphere (A) is facing us, the flux is F_A = (unspotted part of A * σ T^4) + (spotted part of A * σ (T-1000)^4).

Wait, the unspotted part of A is 80% of 2π R², so 1.6π R². The spotted part is 0.4π R².

So F_A = (1.6π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.4π R² * σ (5000)^4)
F_B = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4

So the variation in flux is F_B - F_A when the star rotates so that A is facing us.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be (F_B - F_A) / F_B.

Let me compute F_B - F_A.

F_B = 2π R² σ (6000)^4
F_A = [1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ] * π R² σ

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the ratio.

Let me compute F_A:

F_A = (1.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (5000)^4 ) * (π R² σ )

So F_A = [1.6*(6^4) + 0.4*(5^4)] * (π R² σ )

Similarly, F_B = 2*(6^4) * (π R² σ )

So the delta F is F_B - F_A = [2*(6^4) - 1.6*(6^4) - 0.4*(5^4)] * π R² σ 

Simplify that:

= [ (2 - 1.6) * (6^4) - 0.4*(5^4) ) ] * π R² σ 

= [ 0.4*(6^4) - 0.4*(5^4) ) ] * π R² σ 

Factor 0.4:

= 0.4 [ (6^4) - (5^4) ] π R² σ 

So the fractional change is (delta F) / F_B.

delta F / F_B = [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) ] / [2*(6^4) ]

Let me compute the numerical values.

6^4 = 1296

5^4 = 625

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 - 625 = 671.

So delta F / F_B = [0.4 * 671] / (2 * 1296 )

Calculate numerator: 0.4 * 671 = 268.4

Denominator: 2 * 1296 = 2592

So delta F / F_B = 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% change in brightness.

Wait, no. Wait, because F is proportional to T^4 and area. So the flux from each part is area * T^4.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute the terms step by step.

Compute 6^4: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296.

5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625.

So, the term [ (6^4) - (5^4) ] is 1296 - 625 = 671.

So, 0.4 * 671 = 268.4.

Denominator is 2 * 1296 = 2592.

So 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035, so about 10.35% change in flux.

Wait, but this is the fraction of F. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_A, which is lower than F_B. So the change in flux is F_B - F_A, which is about 10.35% of F_B.

Wait, no, wait: the fractional change would be (F_A - F_B) / F_B, but since F_A is less than F_B, the change would be negative, but in terms of magnitude, it's about 10.35% of F_B.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the amplitude as the maximum dip in brightness, so it's the fractional decrease. So the dip is about 10.35% of the star's flux.

Wait, but the question says: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, what exoplanet radius would be needed? So the exoplanet's transit would cause a dip equal in amplitude to this 10.35% dip.

Wait, but wait, the dip from the planet would be when the planet blocks part of the star's light. The dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because it's the area blocked relative to the star's area.

Wait, but the dip from the spots is 10.35% or about 0.1035 in fractional terms. So the planet's effect would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp^2 = 0.1035 * Rstar^2 → Rp = sqrt(0.1035) * Rstar.

Compute sqrt(0.1035): let's see, 0.1 is 0.316, 0.102 is about 0.319. Wait, 0.1035 is closer to 0.322. Let me compute 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is 0.1024, which is about 0.1035. So sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322. So Rp ≈ 0.322 * Rstar.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32, which is close. Option A is ~0.39, which is larger. Option C is ~0.11, which is smaller. Option B is 0.07.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait the fractional change due to the exoplanet transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 10.35%, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322.

So the closest option is D: ~0.32.

But wait, let me check the initial calculation again. The fractional change when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is (F_B - F_A)/F_B = 0.1035. So the dip is about 10% of the star's flux.

But wait, what if the star rotates so that only part of the spotty hemisphere is visible? Or perhaps I'm modeling the situation incorrectly. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's total surface is 4πR². The hemisphere with spots has an area of 2πR², of which 20% is spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from the spotty and non-spotty parts of that hemisphere. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemisphere = (area_non_spotty * T_eff^4) + (area_spotty * T_spot^4)

= ( (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * (6000)^4 ) + (0.4π R² * 5000^4 )

= (1.6 π R² * 6000^4 ) + (0.4 π R² * 5000^4 )

And the flux from the other hemisphere (unspotty) is 2π R² * 6000^4.

So when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere facing us, the flux is F_spotty_hemisphere + F_other_hemisphere.

Wait no, no. Because the other hemisphere is not facing us. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the back and doesn't contribute. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is viewed is F_A = (1.6π R² * 6000^4) + (0.4π R² *5000^4) )

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_B = 2π R² *6000^4.

Wait, but that's not correct because the other hemisphere isn't the opposite of the spotty one. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe the star's surface isn't divided into two hemispheres where one is entirely spotty and the other is not. Actually, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't see any spots.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to model it. Because the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower, and when it's not, the flux is higher.

So F_high = flux when unspotty hemisphere is facing us: 2π R² * (6000)^4

F_low = flux when spotty hemisphere is facing us: [ (2π R² - 0.2*2π R²) * (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * 2π R² * (5000)^4 ) ]

Wait, because the area of the spotty hemisphere is 2π R², 20% of which is spots. So the unspotted area on that hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

So:

F_low = (1.6 π R² * 6000^4) + (0.4 π R² * 5000^4 )

F_high = 2 π R² * 6000^4

So the difference between F_high and F_low is:

ΔF = F_high - F_low = [2 π R² *6^4 ] - [1.6 π R² *6^4 + 0.4 π R² *5^4 ]

= [ (2 -1.6)π R² *6^4 - 0.4 π R² *5^4 ] 

= [0.4 π R² (6^4) - 0.4 π R² (5^4) ]

= 0.4 π R² [ (6^4 -5^4) ]

So ΔF = 0.4 π R² (1296 - 625) 

= 0.4 π R² (671 )

= (0.4 * 671) π R² = 268.4 π R².

The fractional change is ΔF / F_high.

F_high = 2 π R² * 6^4 = 2 π R² * 1296 = 2592 π R².

So ΔF / F_high = 268.4 π R² / 2592 π R² ) = 268.4 /2592 ≈ 0.1035, so ~10.35%.

So the amplitude (the dip) is about 10.35% of the star's brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Now, the amplitude caused by an exoplanet transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need to set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which matches this.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we first calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (i.e., 5000 K).

### Step 1: Total Flux Without Spots
The total flux from the star without spots is proportional to its surface area and the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
\[
F_{\text{total}} = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]

### Step 2: Flux When Spotted Hemisphere is Visible
When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The spotty hemisphere has an area of \(2\pi R^2\), with 20% (0.4\(\pi R^2\)) covered by spots at 5000 K and the remaining 80% (1.6\(\pi R^2\)) at 6000 K. The flux in this case is:
\[
F_{\text{low}} = \left(1.6\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4\right) + \left(0.4\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 5000^4\right)
\]

### Step 3: Flux When Unspotted Hemisphere is Visible
When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
\[
F_{\text{high}} = 2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4
\]

### Step 4: Fractional Change in Brightness
The fractional change in brightness is the difference between \(F_{\text{high}}\) and \(F_{\text{low}}\), divided by \(F_{\text{high}}\):
\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{high}} - F_{\text{low}}
\]
\[
\Delta F = \left[2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4\right] - \left[1.6\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 5000^4\right]
\]
\[
\Delta F = 0.4\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot \left(6000^4 - 5000^4\right)
\]

The fractional change is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{high}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot \left(6000^4 - 5000^4\right)}{2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{high}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \left(6000^4 - 5000^4\right)}{2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Calculation
Using \(6000^4 = 1296\) and \(5000^4 = 625\):
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{high}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot (1296 - 625)}{2 \cdot 1296}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{high}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 671}{2592}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{high}}} \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
\]

### Step 6: Exoplanet Radius for the Same Amplitude
The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transit is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
\]

### Step 7: Closest Option
The closest option to \(0.322\) is **D) ~0.32**.

ANSWER: D
