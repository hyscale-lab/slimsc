Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right way to approach it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is an acetophenone derivative, so the substituents are attached to the benzene ring, and the ketone is on the ethyl group attached to the benzene.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. The ketone is at position 1, which I think would be the same as the position where the ethyl group is attached.

So, benzene needs to undergo several reactions to get to this compound. Let's think about the possible steps.

First, I know that substituting benzene with a nitro group usually happens under strong nitrating conditions, using HNO3 and H2SO4. That's the typical nitrating mixture. Nitration is a meta-directing group, so the next substituents will go into the meta position relative to it.

Wait, but the target has two substituents, Br and NO2. The positions are 3 and 5, which are both meta to each other. Because in a benzene ring, if one substituent is at position 1, the next meta substituent would be position 3, and the fifth position would be another substituent, but that's two substituents. Hmm, wait, wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

The target structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an ethyl ketone (CH2COR?) Wait, no, wait, the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached directly to the benzene? So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an ethanone group at position 1.

Wait, so the substituents are at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). No, wait, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has the ketone group at position 1, then the nitro group at position 5, and the bromine at position 3. So they are all meta to each other as much as possible.

But benzene can't have three substituents all meta to each other. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. But in this case, the target has two substituents: Br at 3, NO2 at 5, and the ethanone group at position 1. So it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the three substituents are at positions 1,3,5.

Wait, but that would make them all meta to each other. But benzene can't have three substituents all meta. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Alternatively, maybe the benzene has two substituents, and the ketone is attached via a single bond. Wait, no; the ethanone is part of the substituent attached to the benzene.

Wait, the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group (the benzene ring) is attached to the ethanone at position 1 of the ethanone. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)COCH2-... No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- as a substituent. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-R, where R is connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the IUPAC name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone group is attached as a substituent on the benzene ring. So the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an ethanone group at position 1.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: at positions 1 (ethanone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5. So they are all meta to each other. Wait, but benzene with three substituents at 1,3,5 is a symmetric structure. So all three substituents are meta to each other.

Wait, but how do you get three substituents on benzene in the 1,3,5 positions? Because when you add substituents, each new substituent is directed by the existing ones. So the order in which you introduce the substituents matters.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Start with benzene.

2. Introduce the first substituent. Let's say we nitrate it. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director.

3. Next, introduce another substituent. Where would it go? Since nitro is meta, adding the next group would go into the meta position relative to nitro, which is position 3 of the benzene ring.

Wait, but if the first substituent is nitro in position 1, the second substituent would go into position 3, which is meta to nitro. Then the third substituent would go into position 5, which is meta to the second substituent (Br, perhaps), but wait, no, because the nitro is at position 1, and Br at 3.

Wait, perhaps the order should be such that after each substitution, the next group goes to a certain position.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a) First nitrate benzene to get nitro group at position 1.

b) Then, brominate using FeBr3, which is a meta director. So bromine would go into position 3.

c) Then, introduce the ketone group. But wait, how do you introduce a ketone substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via an acylation. For example, using CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst (Friedel-Crafts acylation) to add the acetyl group.

But Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Nitro is a deactivating group, so it deactivates the ring. So once you have nitro and bromine on the ring, the ring is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

So the order of adding substituents is important. If you have to add a ketone group (which is an acyl group), you need the ring to be activated. Because nitro groups deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult.

So perhaps the ketone should be introduced first, before adding deactivating groups.

Wait, but the target molecule has both nitro and bromine substituents, which are meta directors and deactivating. So the ketone would be a strong activating group, so if we add it first, then the next substituents would be directed by it.

Wait, but the ketone is an acyl group, which is a meta director and deactivating, right? Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to benzene. The acyl group (like acetophenone) is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So if the first substituent is the acetyl group, then the next substituents would be added meta to it.

So, let's think: first, add the acetyl group (Friedel-Crafts) to benzene, making acetophenone. Then, add nitro group in the meta position relative to the acetyl. Then, add bromine in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But wait, the target has the acetyl at position 1, nitro at 5, and bromine at 3. Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try numbering the benzene ring. Let me imagine the acetyl group is at position 1. Then, the nitro group is at position 5 (which is two positions away, but wait, in benzene, positions are adjacent in a ring. So position 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and back to 1. So if the acetyl is at 1, then the meta positions would be 4. So I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituent addition.

The target has:

- Acetyl group (ethan-1-one) attached to benzene.

- Nitro group at position 3 relative to the acetyl.

- Bromine at position 5 relative to the acetyl.

Wait, but that would require that the nitro and bromine are both meta to the acetyl group.

Since the acetyl is a meta director, the nitro and bromine would be added in the meta positions relative to it. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Adding two substituents meta to the acetyl would be at positions 3 and 5?

Wait, perhaps the acetyl is at position 1. Then, the next substituents would go to position 3 and 5, as they are meta to the acetyl.

So, the plan would be:

1. Acetophenone (add acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts).

2. Nitrate the ring (add nitro group, which is meta to acetyl, at position 3).

3. Then, brominate (add Br, which would be meta to the nitro group, but wait, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So after nitration, the next substitution (bromination) would go meta to nitro group.

But wait, the first substituent is acetyl (position 1), then nitro at 3. Now, the next substituent would be Br, which would be directed by the nitro group. Nitro is meta, so the Br would go to position 5 (since position 3 is where nitro is, so meta to that is position 5, perhaps? Wait, let me think: if the nitro is at position 3, then the meta positions would be 6 and another position. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are to first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate, but considering where each substituent directs the next.

Wait, another approach: the target has three substituents on benzene: acetyl, nitro, and Br, all at the 1,3,5 positions. So the order of adding substituents must be such that each directs the next into the correct position.

So the first substituent is acetyl at position 1. Then, the next substituent, nitro, is added. Since acetyl is meta-directing, the nitro would go into position 3. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Now, the next substituent, Br, needs to go into position 5. Where would it go?

Wait, the current substituents are acetyl (activating? No, wait, acetyl is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So the ring is deactivating now. But adding Br via FeBr3 requires an activating group to direct, because FeBr3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for electrophilic substitution, but if the ring is deactivating, the reaction might not proceed easily.

Alternatively, maybe the order is incorrect. Maybe the Br is added before the nitro group.

Let me think again: perhaps the acetyl is added first, then Br, then nitro.

But wait, let's consider the directing effects.

1. Add acetyl group (position 1). Now, the ring has an acetyl group, which is meta-directing.

2. Next, bromination. The Br would go into position 3 (meta to acetyl).

3. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Next, nitration. Nitro is a meta director, but where would it go?

The acetyl and Br are both meta directors. The existing substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, when adding the nitro group, it would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but the acetyl is at 1, and Br at 3. So the ring now has substituents at 1 and 3. The next substituent—nitro—would be added in a position that's meta to both, but that's not possible in a benzene ring. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the acetyl group. So:

1. Nitration first: nitro group at position 1.

2. Then, bromination: since nitro is meta-directing, Br would go to position 3.

3. Then, acetylation: but wait, after adding nitro and Br, the ring is highly deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

So that approach won't work.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps the acetyl group must be added before any deactivating groups because Friedel-Crafts won't proceed once the ring is deactivated.

So, the order must be:

1. Acetylate benzene to get acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone to add nitro group meta to acetyl, so nitro at position 3.

3. Then, brominate, but wait, after nitration, the ring has nitro group (deactivating), so bromination might not proceed easily, unless perhaps we have a way to activate the ring.

Wait, but bromination is an electrophilic substitution. If the ring is deactivated, bromination would be difficult. So perhaps after nitration, we can't brominate.

This is a problem. So maybe the order should be:

1. Acetylate (Friedel-Crafts), position 1.

2. Brominate (FeBr3), which is a meta director. So Br would go to position 3.

3. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Now, nitrate. But nitration is a strong nitronium ion attack. Since the ring is deactivated by both acetyl and Br (Br is ortho/para director but deactivating?), wait, wait, what's the directing effect of Br?

Wait, bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity). So, in the presence of Br and acetyl, which substituent would direct the incoming nitro group?

If the substituents are at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br), which is a deactivating group. So, the nitro attack would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, the acetyl is at 1, which is a meta director, and Br is at 3, which is an ortho/para director.

So, when adding nitro, the possible positions are influenced by both substituents.

Let me visualize:

Positions:

1: acetyl (meta director)
3: Br (ortho/para director)

Looking for where the nitro would go.

Nitro is a strong deactivating group. The existing substituents are acetyl (position 1), which directs meta (positions 4?), and Br (position 3), which directs ortho (position 2 and 4) and para (position 6).

Wait, that's confusing. Let me number the benzene:

Positions:

1: acetyl
2: adjacent to 1
3: Br
4: adjacent to 3 and opposite to 1
5: adjacent to 4
6: adjacent to 5 and 1.

Wait, if I have substituents at 1 and 3, where can the nitro group go?

The acetyl at 1 is a meta director, so it would direct to position 4.

The Br at 3 is an ortho/para director. Its ortho positions are 2 and 4. Para position is 6.

So, the nitro group would be directed to position 4 by acetyl (meta), and position 4 is also an ortho position for Br. So, the nitro would go to position 4.

But in the target molecule, we have substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3). So, in this approach, the nitro would end up at position 4, which is not the target's position.

Hmm. That doesn't align with the target structure. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternatively, maybe the order of adding substituents is different. Let me think again.

What if I first add the Br, then the nitro group, then the acetyl group?

1. Benzene → brominate → bromobenzene. Br is ortho/para director.

2. Nitrate bromobenzene. Since Br is a deactivating, meta director (no, wait, Br is ortho/para director but deactivating), so nitration would occur at para position relative to Br. So nitro would be at position 4.

3. Now, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4. Now, need to add the acetyl group. But the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible.

So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the acetyl group is added last, but the ring must be activated enough for Friedel-Crafts. But after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated. So that won't work.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the possible reaction sequences given in the options.

Looking at the options, each is a sequence of reactions starting with benzene. Let's see what each option entails.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), then Br2/FeBr3, then HNO3/H2SO4, then Fe/HCl, HNO3 again, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2.

Wait, that seems like a lot of steps. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the acetyl group, then nitrate, then brominate. But earlier I thought that after nitration, the ring is deactivating, making bromination difficult. But perhaps using a strong enough conditions for bromination.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation), iv) HNO3 again, v) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe something else), iii) CH3COCl, iv) Br2, etc.

Option D: i) HNO3, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl, iv) H3PO2, v) Br2, vi) CH3COCl, vii) HNO3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but in option A, the steps are: acylation, bromination, nitration, etc. But how would that lead to the correct substituents?

Let me try to outline the possible steps for each option.

Option A:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Bromination with FeBr3 → Br adds meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Nitration → nitro group adds meta to acetyl (position 4? But we need position 5).

Hmm, this seems not to fit.

Wait, after step 2, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Now, step 3 is nitration. The nitro would go where?

The substituents are acetyl (1, meta) and Br (3, ortho/para).

So the nitro group would be directed to position 4, because it's meta to acetyl and ortho to Br.

But in the target, nitro is at position 5. So perhaps this sequence is incorrect.

Option B:

1. Benzene → brominate → bromobenzene (Br at position 1).

2. Nitrate → nitro group would be para to Br (position 4).

3. Acetylate → acetyl group would be directed by Br and nitro.

Wait, after steps 1 and 2, substituents are Br (1) and nitro (4). Now, acetylation.

But the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So this option is likely incorrect.

Option C:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

2. Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction? Maybe reduce nitro to amine, but that doesn't make sense here.

Wait, Fe/HCl is a condition for something else. Maybe it's a catalyst for something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after nitration, the next step is Fe/HCl, which could be for a different reaction.

Hmm, not sure about this option.

Option D:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

2. Fe/HCl → perhaps it's for something else, maybe a substitution.

3. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's for amines.

Wait, I'm not sure about this sequence either.

Hmm. Maybe back to the drawing board.

Another approach: The target molecule has substituents at positions 1,3,5. The acetyl is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, how can these substituents be introduced?

Wait, perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, then nitro, then Br. But after nitration, the ring is deactivating, making bromination difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a meta director for Br. Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director.

Wait, but maybe if the ring has two substituents, the direction is determined by the strongest director.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation and nitration, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, the next substituent Br would be directed by which group?

Wait, acetyl is meta director, nitro is meta. So the possible positions would be 5, which is meta to nitro (3) and para to acetyl (1)? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then Br, then acetyl. But then, Friedel-Crafts won't work.

This is getting too confusing. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

So, their positions are 1,3,5 on the benzene ring.

I think the correct order is to first add the acetyl group (since it's an activating group, allowing subsequent reactions), then nitro, then Br.

Wait, but in that case, after adding acetyl (1), nitro would go to position 3. Then, adding Br would go meta to acetyl, but what's the position?

Wait, after steps 1 and 2, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, for Br addition, it's directed by both acetyl and nitro.

Since acetyl is at 1 (meta director, so directs to 4), and nitro is at 3 (meta director, directs to 6 and 2). Wait, but position 4 is meta to acetyl, and position 6 is para to nitro.

Wait, the substituents are at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Where would Br go?

The possible positions would be influenced by both substituents.

The acetyl (1) is meta, so it would direct to position 4. Nitro (3) is meta, so it would direct to positions 6 and 2 (ortho) and para (position 6, perhaps)?

Wait, but the acetyl is a stronger director? Or nitro?

Wait, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director. Acetyl is deactivating and meta.

So, perhaps the Br would go to position 5. Because position 5 is meta to acetyl (1) and meta to nitro (3) as well? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in the options are designed in a way that involves more than just substitution. Maybe some steps involve functional group transformations.

Wait, another possibility: the nitro group could be introduced after the acetyl, but perhaps after some protection or something.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added after the acetyl, but the bromine is added via a different pathway, like perhaps in a side chain.

Wait, that's not likely because the bromine is on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but then the ring is somehow activated for the acylation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added via a different position.

Wait, perhaps the key is the order of nitration and bromination. So, the nitro group is added first, then bromine, then the acetyl.

But then, after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acylation won't proceed.

So, that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group added meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Now, the substituents are 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Now, brominate. But the ring is deactivated; how?

Wait, maybe under strong conditions, like using a Lewis acid? Or perhaps using a different catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is added via another method, like a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B's steps are:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Since Br is ortho/para director, nitro would go para to Br, so position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But now, the ring has Br (1) and nitro (4). Both are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So acetophenone can't be formed. So Option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But that's not necessary.

iii) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts. But ring is deactivated by nitro, so no.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → not sure.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine?

Wait, but that's a stretch. Then, Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

But again, after nitration and other steps, the ring may be deactivated.

Hmm.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br adds meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate, which would go where? Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). The nitro group would be directed by both.

If the nitro is directed by acetyl (meta) → position 4.

But in the target, it's at position 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a different orientation.

Wait, after acetylation and bromination, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Now, nitration would add nitro group in a position that is meta to acetyl (position 4) and ortho to Br (position 4 is ortho to 3? No, position 4 is adjacent to 3, so ortho to Br.

So, in that case, the nitro would go to position 4.

But the target has nitro at 5, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to nitrate first, then brominate, then acetylate. But that's not possible because the ring is deactivated.

Another thought: perhaps a director group is added that allows for acylation after nitration and bromination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a diazonium salt.

Wait, for example, introducing a nitro group via a diazonium salt would require an amine, which would have to be introduced first. But that's a longer process.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added via a substitution reaction, but that's more common in aromatic substitution with leaving groups, which isn't the case here.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for which option has Friedel-Crafts acylation as the last step, because the ring must be activated for that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Friedel-Crafts is step i).

Option B: step iii).

Option C: step iii).

Option D: step vi).

So, in option D, the acylation is the last step. So the ring would have nitro and Br, which are deactivating, making acylation impossible. So option D is unlikely.

In option B, acylation is step iii), after bromination and nitration. But again, the ring is deactivated.

Option C: acylation is step iii), after nitration and Fe/HCl. Not sure.

Only option A and B have acylation early enough.

Option A: after acylation, bromination, then nitration.

So, for target substituents 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro).

After steps i and ii in option A: acetyl at 1, Br at 3.

Now, step iii: nitration. Where would the nitro go? It's meta to acetyl (position 4) but ortho to Br (position 4).

So, nitro would go to position 4. But the target needs it at 5.

So, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added para to Br.

Wait, Br is at 3. Para to Br is position 7? No, benzene is 6-membered. Para to position 3 is position 6.

So, in step iii of option A, nitration would go to position 6 (para to Br) or position 4 (meta to acetyl and ortho to Br).

But in the target, it's at 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration step adds the nitro group para to Br, but that would be position 6, which is not the target.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe the correct option is C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reducing nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation. But if ring has NH2, which is activating, then acylation can proceed.

Wait, that's a new thought. Let me think.

Nitration first: benzene → nitrobenzene (1).

Then, Fe/HCl. Wait, what's Fe/HCl used for? Maybe it's for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reducing agent. Fe/HCl is sometimes used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines.

So, step ii: nitro group is reduced to amine (NH2 at 1).

Step iii: acylation. Amine is a strong activating group, so acylation via Friedel-Crafts would add acetyl group at meta position relative to NH2. So, acetyl would go to position 3.

Now, substituents are NH2 (1) and acetyl (3).

Then, step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But NH2 is a strong activating group, so bromine would be directed by NH2.

Wait, NH2 is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, Br would add at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to NH2 (position 1).

But acetyl is at position 3. So, if Br is added at position 5 (which is para to NH2?), wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is added at position 5 because of the acetyl group.

Wait, the ring now has NH2 (1), acetyl (3). So, adding Br would be influenced by both.

NH2 (1) is ortho/para, so Br could go to 2,4,6.

Acetyl (3) is meta director, so Br could go to 6 (meta to 3? Because 3 → meta would be 6).

So, Br could add at position 6 (meta to acetyl) and para to NH2 (position 1). So, position 6.

But the target has Br at position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting more confused.

Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added after the acetyl group, but then after nitration, we reduce it to amine, which directs the next substitution.

Wait, let's think:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (1).

2. Nitrate → nitro group at 3.

3. Reduce nitro to NH2 → amine group at 3.

4. Acetylate again? No, that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps:

1. Acetylate → acetophenone (1).

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Now, reduce nitro to NH2 (3).

4. Brominate → Br would add at position 5 (meta to NH2).

But in this scenario, the substituents would be 1 (acetyl), 3 (NH2), and 5 (Br). Hmm.

But in the target, position 3 is Br and 5 is nitro. So, this doesn't match.

I think I'm stuck. I'll try to think about the correct order of reactions.

The target structure has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

The order of addition should ensure each substituent is added in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate → acetophenone (1).

2. Nitrate → nitro group at 3 (meta to acetyl).

3. Brominate → Br would be directed where? Now, ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3).

Nitro is a strong meta director, so the Br would be added at position 5 (meta to nitro), which is also para to acetyl (1). So that would fit the target structure.

But wait, after steps 1 and 2, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, bromination would be directed by nitro, which is a stronger director than acetyl. So, Br would go meta to nitro, which is position 6 (since 3 → meta is 6). No, that's not correct.

Wait, position 3 in benzene is a substituent. Its meta positions are 6 and another position.

Wait, benzene is a ring. So, substituent at 3: the meta positions are 6 and perhaps another? Let me number the ring with substituent at 3: positions 3, 6 are meta.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the ring with substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Where will the Br go?

The substituents are acetyl (1, meta director) and nitro (3, meta director).

The incoming Br would look for positions that are meta to either.

So, meta to acetyl (1) is position 4.

Meta to nitro (3) is position 6 and position 2.

So, possible positions for Br are 2,4,6.

Which is more favorable?

If both are meta directors, perhaps the position where both agree is favored. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, nitro is a stronger director than acetyl because it's a strong deactivating group. So, the Br would go to a position meta to nitro, which is 6 and 2.

If the current substituents are 1 and 3, the available positions are 2,4,5,6.

If Br goes to position 5, that's not meta to either. So perhaps that won't happen.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to add the nitro group, then the acetyl, then the Br. But I can't see how that would work because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at the options again.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction of diazonium salt to something else. Maybe to amine again? Not sure.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration again.

This seems complicated. But perhaps it's a way to add substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine (NH2 at 1).

Step iii: diazotization (turns NH2 into diazonium salt).

Step iv: H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent) - perhaps reduce the diazonium salt to something else, like a methyl group. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to substitute the diazonium salt.

Wait, H3PO2 is usually used for reducing nitro groups to amines, but in some cases, it can be used for other reductions.

Wait, perhaps after steps i to iv, the ring has a substituent that's a good director for the next steps.

But this is getting too complicated.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The correct sequence must involve acetylation early, before deactivating groups are added. So, Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) is step i.

Then, nitration (HNO3) would add nitro in the meta position relative to acetyl. Then, bromination would go meta to nitro.

Wait, but acetylation is step i, then bromination (step ii) would add Br meta to acetyl.

Then nitration (step iii) would add nitro meta to acetyl and Br.

But in the target, nitro is at 5. Let me see.

So, if acetylation is first (position 1), bromination adds Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl), then nitration adds nitro where? It's influenced by both acetyl and Br.

Acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para.

So, the nitro might go to position 5, which is meta to acetyl (1) and para to Br (3). Because position 5 is meta to 1 and para to 3.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Acetophenone (1).

2. Br adds at 3.

3. Nitro adds at 5.

So, the order is: acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back at the options, which option does this?

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br adds at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro adds at 5.

Then, steps iv to vii are perhaps further reactions, but in the target, we only need three substituents. But the options have more steps.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which would have the acetyl, Br, and nitro substituents. So, perhaps the option that includes these steps is the correct one.

Looking at option B: steps are Br, nitro, acylation. No, that doesn't fit.

Option A's steps: acylation, bromination, nitration. So, after step iii, we have the correct substituents. But the option continues with other steps, which may be unnecessary or perhaps part of the process.

But the question is about the sequence that would lead to the target, regardless of extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is achieved after steps i, ii, iii in option A, but the subsequent steps are for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, the target requires three substituents: acetyl, Br, nitro. So, the correct sequence must include these three steps in the right order, with the correct directing.

So, the sequence must be:

1. Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).

2. Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) → Br meta to acetyl.

3. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → nitro added meta to acetyl and para to Br, which is position 5.

So, the correct option must have these three steps in this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So, after these three steps, the substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). Which matches the target.

So, in option A, the first three steps achieve the correct substituents. Any subsequent steps (iv to vii) would be extra, but perhaps they don't affect the structure further, or they might be part of another process. But the question is about the sequence that leads to the target, so perhaps option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro groups) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has the acetyl group at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5, all of which are meta to each other.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with FeBr3 adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group and para to the bromine).  
   After these three steps, the benzene ring has the correct substituents in the desired positions. The subsequent steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary for achieving the target molecule but may represent additional transformations.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (para to bromine).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro and bromine groups, making it impossible to introduce the acetyl group.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose but likely involves reduction or another transformation.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose but may involve reduction or another transformation.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and reduction with H3PO2 are typically used for introducing substituents via diazonium salts, but the sequence does not align with the desired substitution pattern.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option A**, where the acetyl group is introduced first, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This ensures that the substituents are added in the correct meta positions relative to each other. The subsequent steps in Option A are unnecessary for achieving the target molecule but do not interfere with its formation.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right way to approach it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is an acetophenone derivative, so the substituents are attached to the benzene ring, and the ketone is on the ethyl group attached to the benzene.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. The ketone is at position 1, which I think would be the same as the position where the ethyl group is attached.

So, benzene needs to undergo several reactions to get to this compound. Let's think about the possible steps.

First, I know that substituting benzene with a nitro group usually happens under strong nitrating conditions, using HNO3 and H2SO4. That's the typical nitrating mixture. Nitration is a meta-directing group, so the next substituents will go into the meta position relative to it.

Wait, but the target has two substituents, Br and NO2. The positions are 3 and 5, which are both meta to each other. Because in a benzene ring, if one substituent is at position 1, the next meta substituent would be position 3, and the fifth position would be another substituent, but that's two substituents. Hmm, wait, wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

The target structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an ethyl ketone (CH2COR?) Wait, no, wait, the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached directly to the benzene? So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an ethanone group at position 1.

Wait, so the substituents are at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). No, wait, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has the ketone group at position 1, then the nitro group at position 5, and the bromine at position 3. So they are all meta to each other as much as possible.

But benzene can't have three substituents all meta to each other. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. But in this case, the target has two substituents: Br at 3, NO2 at 5, and the ethanone group at position 1. So it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the three substituents are at positions 1,3,5.

Wait, but that would make them all meta to each other. But benzene can't have three substituents all meta. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Alternatively, maybe the benzene has two substituents, and the ketone is attached via a single bond. Wait, no; the ethanone is part of the substituent attached to the benzene.

Wait, the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group (the benzene ring) is attached to the ethanone at position 1 of the ethanone. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)COCH2-... No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- as a substituent. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-R, where R is connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the IUPAC name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone group is attached as a substituent on the benzene ring. So the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an ethanone group at position 1.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: at positions 1 (ethanone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5. So they are all meta to each other. Wait, but benzene with three substituents at 1,3,5 is a symmetric structure. So all three substituents are meta to each other.

Wait, but how do you get three substituents on benzene in the 1,3,5 positions? Because when you add substituents, each new substituent is directed by the existing ones. So the order in which you introduce the substituents matters.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Start with benzene.

2. Introduce the first substituent. Let's say we nitrate it. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director.

3. Next, introduce another substituent. Where would it go? Since nitro is meta, adding the next group would go into the meta position relative to nitro, which is position 3 of the benzene ring.

Wait, but if the first substituent is nitro in position 1, the second substituent would go into position 3, which is meta to nitro. Then the third substituent would go into position 5, which is meta to the second substituent (Br, perhaps), but wait, no, because the nitro is at position 1, and Br at 3.

Wait, perhaps the order should be such that after each substitution, the next group goes to a certain position.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a) First nitrate benzene to get nitro group at position 1.

b) Then, brominate using FeBr3, which is a meta director. So bromine would go into position 3.

c) Then, introduce the ketone group. But wait, how do you introduce a ketone substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via an acylation. For example, using CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst (Friedel-Crafts acylation) to add the acetyl group.

But Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Nitro is a deactivating group, so it deactivates the ring. So once you have nitro and bromine on the ring, the ring is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

So the order of adding substituents is important. If you have to add a ketone group (which is an acyl group), you need the ring to be activated. Because nitro groups deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult.

So perhaps the ketone should be introduced first, before adding deactivating groups.

Wait, but the target molecule has both nitro and bromine substituents, which are meta directors and deactivating. So the ketone would be a strong activating group, so if we add it first, then the next substituents would be directed by it.

Wait, but the ketone is an acyl group, which is a meta director and deactivating, right? Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to benzene. The acyl group (like acetophenone) is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So if the first substituent is the acetyl group, then the next substituents would be added meta to it.

So, let's think: first, add the acetyl group (Friedel-Crafts) to benzene, making acetophenone. Then, add nitro group in the meta position relative to the acetyl. Then, add bromine in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But wait, the target has the acetyl at position 1, nitro at 5, and bromine at 3. Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try numbering the benzene ring. Let me imagine the acetyl group is at position 1. Then, the nitro group is at position 5 (which is two positions away, but wait, in benzene, positions are adjacent in a ring. So position 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and back to 1. So if the acetyl is at 1, then the meta positions would be 4. So I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituent addition.

The target has:

- Acetyl group (ethan-1-one) attached to benzene.

- Nitro group at position 3 relative to the acetyl.

- Bromine at position 5 relative to the acetyl.

Wait, but that would require that the nitro and bromine are both meta to the acetyl group.

Since the acetyl is a meta director, the nitro and bromine would be added in the meta positions relative to it. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Adding two substituents meta to the acetyl would be at positions 3 and 5?

Wait, perhaps the acetyl is at position 1. Then, the next substituents would go to position 3 and 5, as they are meta to the acetyl.

So, the plan would be:

1. Acetophenone (add acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts).

2. Nitrate the ring (add nitro group, which is meta to acetyl, at position 3).

3. Then, brominate (add Br, which would be meta to the nitro group, but wait, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So after nitration, the next substitution (bromination) would go meta to nitro group.

But wait, the first substituent is acetyl (position 1), then nitro at 3. Now, the next substituent would be Br, which would be directed by the nitro group. Nitro is meta, so the Br would go to position 5 (since position 3 is where nitro is, so meta to that is position 5, perhaps? Wait, let me think: if the nitro is at position 3, then the meta positions would be 6 and another position. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are to first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate, but considering where each substituent directs the next.

Wait, another approach: the target has three substituents on benzene: acetyl, nitro, and Br, all at the 1,3,5 positions. So the order of adding substituents must be such that each directs the next into the correct position.

So the first substituent is acetyl at position 1. Then, the next substituent, nitro, is added. Since acetyl is meta-directing, the nitro would go into position 3. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Now, the next substituent, Br, needs to go into position 5. Where would it go?

Wait, the current substituents are acetyl (activating? No, wait, acetyl is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So the ring is deactivating now. But adding Br via FeBr3 requires an activating group to direct, because FeBr3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for electrophilic substitution, but if the ring is deactivating, the reaction might not proceed easily.

Alternatively, maybe the order is incorrect. Maybe the Br is added before the nitro group.

Let me think again: perhaps the acetyl is added first, then Br, then nitro.

But wait, let's consider the directing effects.

1. Add acetyl group (position 1). Now, the ring has an acetyl group, which is meta-directing.

2. Next, bromination. The Br would go into position 3 (meta to acetyl).

3. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Next, nitration. Nitro is a meta director, but where would it go?

The acetyl and Br are both meta directors. The existing substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, when adding the nitro group, it would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but the acetyl is at 1, and Br at 3. So the ring now has substituents at 1 and 3. The next substituent—nitro—would be added in a position that's meta to both, but that's not possible in a benzene ring. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the acetyl group. So:

1. Nitration first: nitro group at position 1.

2. Then, bromination: since nitro is meta-directing, Br would go to position 3.

3. Then, acetylation: but wait, after adding nitro and Br, the ring is highly deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

So that approach won't work.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps the acetyl group must be added before any deactivating groups because Friedel-Crafts won't proceed once the ring is deactivated.

So, the order must be:

1. Acetylate benzene to get acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone to add nitro group meta to acetyl, so nitro at position 3.

3. Then, brominate, but wait, after nitration, the ring has nitro group (deactivating), so bromination might not proceed easily, unless perhaps we have a way to activate the ring.

Wait, but bromination is an electrophilic substitution. If the ring is deactivated, bromination would be difficult. So perhaps after nitration, we can't brominate.

This is a problem. So maybe the order should be:

1. Acetylate (Friedel-Crafts), position 1.

2. Brominate (FeBr3), which is a meta director. So Br would go to position 3.

3. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Now, nitrate. But nitration is a strong nitronium ion attack. Since the ring is deactivated by both acetyl and Br (Br is ortho/para director but deactivating?), wait, wait, what's the directing effect of Br?

Wait, bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity). So, in the presence of Br and acetyl, which substituent would direct the incoming nitro group?

If the substituents are at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br), which is a deactivating group. So, the nitro attack would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, the acetyl is at 1, which is a meta director, and Br is at 3, which is an ortho/para director.

So, when adding nitro, the possible positions are influenced by both substituents.

Let me visualize:

Positions:

1: acetyl (meta director)
3: Br (ortho/para director)

Looking for where the nitro would go.

Nitro is a strong deactivating group. The existing substituents are acetyl (position 1), which directs meta (positions 4?), and Br (position 3), which directs ortho (position 2 and 4) and para (position 6).

Wait, that's confusing. Let me number the benzene:

Positions:

1: acetyl
2: adjacent to 1
3: Br
4: adjacent to 3 and opposite to 1
5: adjacent to 4
6: adjacent to 5 and 1.

Wait, if I have substituents at 1 and 3, where can the nitro group go?

The acetyl at 1 is a meta director, so it would direct to position 4.

The Br at 3 is an ortho/para director. Its ortho positions are 2 and 4. Para position is 6.

So, the nitro group would be directed to position 4 by acetyl (meta), and position 4 is also an ortho position for Br. So, the nitro would go to position 4.

But in the target molecule, we have substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3). So, in this approach, the nitro would end up at position 4, which is not the target's position.

Hmm. That doesn't align with the target structure. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternatively, maybe the order of adding substituents is different. Let me think again.

What if I first add the Br, then the nitro group, then the acetyl group?

1. Benzene → brominate → bromobenzene. Br is ortho/para director.

2. Nitrate bromobenzene. Since Br is a deactivating, meta director (no, wait, Br is ortho/para director but deactivating), so nitration would occur at para position relative to Br. So nitro would be at position 4.

3. Now, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4. Now, need to add the acetyl group. But the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible.

So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the acetyl group is added last, but the ring must be activated enough for Friedel-Crafts. But after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated. So that won't work.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the possible reaction sequences given in the options.

Looking at the options, each is a sequence of reactions starting with benzene. Let's see what each option entails.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), then Br2/FeBr3, then HNO3/H2SO4, then Fe/HCl, HNO3 again, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2.

Wait, that seems like a lot of steps. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the acetyl group, then nitrate, then brominate. But earlier I thought that after nitration, the ring is deactivating, making bromination difficult. But perhaps using a strong enough conditions for bromination.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation), iv) HNO3 again, v) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe something else), iii) CH3COCl, iv) Br2, etc.

Option D: i) HNO3, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl, iv) H3PO2, v) Br2, vi) CH3COCl, vii) HNO3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but in option A, the steps are: acylation, bromination, nitration, etc. But how would that lead to the correct substituents?

Let me try to outline the possible steps for each option.

Option A:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Bromination with FeBr3 → Br adds meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Nitration → nitro group adds meta to acetyl (position 4? But we need position 5).

Hmm, this seems not to fit.

Wait, after step 2, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Now, step 3 is nitration. The nitro would go where?

The substituents are acetyl (1, meta) and Br (3, ortho/para).

So the nitro group would be directed to position 4, because it's meta to acetyl and ortho to Br.

But in the target, nitro is at position 5. So perhaps this sequence is incorrect.

Option B:

1. Benzene → brominate → bromobenzene (Br at position 1).

2. Nitrate → nitro group would be para to Br (position 4).

3. Acetylate → acetyl group would be directed by Br and nitro.

Wait, after steps 1 and 2, substituents are Br (1) and nitro (4). Now, acetylation.

But the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So this option is likely incorrect.

Option C:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

2. Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction? Maybe reduce nitro to amine, but that doesn't make sense here.

Wait, Fe/HCl is a condition for something else. Maybe it's a catalyst for something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after nitration, the next step is Fe/HCl, which could be for a different reaction.

Hmm, not sure about this option.

Option D:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

2. Fe/HCl → perhaps it's for something else, maybe a substitution.

3. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's for amines.

Wait, I'm not sure about this sequence either.

Hmm. Maybe back to the drawing board.

Another approach: The target molecule has substituents at positions 1,3,5. The acetyl is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, how can these substituents be introduced?

Wait, perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, then nitro, then Br. But after nitration, the ring is deactivating, making bromination difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a meta director for Br. Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director.

Wait, but maybe if the ring has two substituents, the direction is determined by the strongest director.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation and nitration, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, the next substituent Br would be directed by which group?

Wait, acetyl is meta director, nitro is meta. So the possible positions would be 5, which is meta to nitro (3) and para to acetyl (1)? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then Br, then acetyl. But then, Friedel-Crafts won't work.

This is getting too confusing. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

So, their positions are 1,3,5 on the benzene ring.

I think the correct order is to first add the acetyl group (since it's an activating group, allowing subsequent reactions), then nitro, then Br.

Wait, but in that case, after adding acetyl (1), nitro would go to position 3. Then, adding Br would go meta to acetyl, but what's the position?

Wait, after steps 1 and 2, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, for Br addition, it's directed by both acetyl and nitro.

Since acetyl is at 1 (meta director, so directs to 4), and nitro is at 3 (meta director, directs to 6 and 2). Wait, but position 4 is meta to acetyl, and position 6 is para to nitro.

Wait, the substituents are at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Where would Br go?

The possible positions would be influenced by both substituents.

The acetyl (1) is meta, so it would direct to position 4. Nitro (3) is meta, so it would direct to positions 6 and 2 (ortho) and para (position 6, perhaps)?

Wait, but the acetyl is a stronger director? Or nitro?

Wait, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director. Acetyl is deactivating and meta.

So, perhaps the Br would go to position 5. Because position 5 is meta to acetyl (1) and meta to nitro (3) as well? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in the options are designed in a way that involves more than just substitution. Maybe some steps involve functional group transformations.

Wait, another possibility: the nitro group could be introduced after the acetyl, but perhaps after some protection or something.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added after the acetyl, but the bromine is added via a different pathway, like perhaps in a side chain.

Wait, that's not likely because the bromine is on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but then the ring is somehow activated for the acylation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added via a different position.

Wait, perhaps the key is the order of nitration and bromination. So, the nitro group is added first, then bromine, then the acetyl.

But then, after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated, so acylation won't proceed.

So, that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group added meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Now, the substituents are 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Now, brominate. But the ring is deactivated; how?

Wait, maybe under strong conditions, like using a Lewis acid? Or perhaps using a different catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is added via another method, like a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B's steps are:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Since Br is ortho/para director, nitro would go para to Br, so position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But now, the ring has Br (1) and nitro (4). Both are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So acetophenone can't be formed. So Option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But that's not necessary.

iii) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts. But ring is deactivated by nitro, so no.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → not sure.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine?

Wait, but that's a stretch. Then, Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

But again, after nitration and other steps, the ring may be deactivated.

Hmm.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br adds meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate, which would go where? Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). The nitro group would be directed by both.

If the nitro is directed by acetyl (meta) → position 4.

But in the target, it's at position 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a different orientation.

Wait, after acetylation and bromination, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Now, nitration would add nitro group in a position that is meta to acetyl (position 4) and ortho to Br (position 4 is ortho to 3? No, position 4 is adjacent to 3, so ortho to Br.

So, in that case, the nitro would go to position 4.

But the target has nitro at 5, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to nitrate first, then brominate, then acetylate. But that's not possible because the ring is deactivated.

Another thought: perhaps a director group is added that allows for acylation after nitration and bromination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a diazonium salt.

Wait, for example, introducing a nitro group via a diazonium salt would require an amine, which would have to be introduced first. But that's a longer process.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added via a substitution reaction, but that's more common in aromatic substitution with leaving groups, which isn't the case here.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for which option has Friedel-Crafts acylation as the last step, because the ring must be activated for that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Friedel-Crafts is step i).

Option B: step iii).

Option C: step iii).

Option D: step vi).

So, in option D, the acylation is the last step. So the ring would have nitro and Br, which are deactivating, making acylation impossible. So option D is unlikely.

In option B, acylation is step iii), after bromination and nitration. But again, the ring is deactivated.

Option C: acylation is step iii), after nitration and Fe/HCl. Not sure.

Only option A and B have acylation early enough.

Option A: after acylation, bromination, then nitration.

So, for target substituents 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro).

After steps i and ii in option A: acetyl at 1, Br at 3.

Now, step iii: nitration. Where would the nitro go? It's meta to acetyl (position 4) but ortho to Br (position 4).

So, nitro would go to position 4. But the target needs it at 5.

So, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added para to Br.

Wait, Br is at 3. Para to Br is position 7? No, benzene is 6-membered. Para to position 3 is position 6.

So, in step iii of option A, nitration would go to position 6 (para to Br) or position 4 (meta to acetyl and ortho to Br).

But in the target, it's at 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration step adds the nitro group para to Br, but that would be position 6, which is not the target.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe the correct option is C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reducing nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation. But if ring has NH2, which is activating, then acylation can proceed.

Wait, that's a new thought. Let me think.

Nitration first: benzene → nitrobenzene (1).

Then, Fe/HCl. Wait, what's Fe/HCl used for? Maybe it's for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reducing agent. Fe/HCl is sometimes used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines.

So, step ii: nitro group is reduced to amine (NH2 at 1).

Step iii: acylation. Amine is a strong activating group, so acylation via Friedel-Crafts would add acetyl group at meta position relative to NH2. So, acetyl would go to position 3.

Now, substituents are NH2 (1) and acetyl (3).

Then, step iv: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But NH2 is a strong activating group, so bromine would be directed by NH2.

Wait, NH2 is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, Br would add at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to NH2 (position 1).

But acetyl is at position 3. So, if Br is added at position 5 (which is para to NH2?), wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is added at position 5 because of the acetyl group.

Wait, the ring now has NH2 (1), acetyl (3). So, adding Br would be influenced by both.

NH2 (1) is ortho/para, so Br could go to 2,4,6.

Acetyl (3) is meta director, so Br could go to 6 (meta to 3? Because 3 → meta would be 6).

So, Br could add at position 6 (meta to acetyl) and para to NH2 (position 1). So, position 6.

But the target has Br at position 3, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting more confused.

Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added after the acetyl group, but then after nitration, we reduce it to amine, which directs the next substitution.

Wait, let's think:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (1).

2. Nitrate → nitro group at 3.

3. Reduce nitro to NH2 → amine group at 3.

4. Acetylate again? No, that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps:

1. Acetylate → acetophenone (1).

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Now, reduce nitro to NH2 (3).

4. Brominate → Br would add at position 5 (meta to NH2).

But in this scenario, the substituents would be 1 (acetyl), 3 (NH2), and 5 (Br). Hmm.

But in the target, position 3 is Br and 5 is nitro. So, this doesn't match.

I think I'm stuck. I'll try to think about the correct order of reactions.

The target structure has substituents at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

The order of addition should ensure each substituent is added in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate → acetophenone (1).

2. Nitrate → nitro group at 3 (meta to acetyl).

3. Brominate → Br would be directed where? Now, ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3).

Nitro is a strong meta director, so the Br would be added at position 5 (meta to nitro), which is also para to acetyl (1). So that would fit the target structure.

But wait, after steps 1 and 2, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, bromination would be directed by nitro, which is a stronger director than acetyl. So, Br would go meta to nitro, which is position 6 (since 3 → meta is 6). No, that's not correct.

Wait, position 3 in benzene is a substituent. Its meta positions are 6 and another position.

Wait, benzene is a ring. So, substituent at 3: the meta positions are 6 and perhaps another? Let me number the ring with substituent at 3: positions 3, 6 are meta.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the ring with substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). Where will the Br go?

The substituents are acetyl (1, meta director) and nitro (3, meta director).

The incoming Br would look for positions that are meta to either.

So, meta to acetyl (1) is position 4.

Meta to nitro (3) is position 6 and position 2.

So, possible positions for Br are 2,4,6.

Which is more favorable?

If both are meta directors, perhaps the position where both agree is favored. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, nitro is a stronger director than acetyl because it's a strong deactivating group. So, the Br would go to a position meta to nitro, which is 6 and 2.

If the current substituents are 1 and 3, the available positions are 2,4,5,6.

If Br goes to position 5, that's not meta to either. So perhaps that won't happen.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to add the nitro group, then the acetyl, then the Br. But I can't see how that would work because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at the options again.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction of diazonium salt to something else. Maybe to amine again? Not sure.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration again.

This seems complicated. But perhaps it's a way to add substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine (NH2 at 1).

Step iii: diazotization (turns NH2 into diazonium salt).

Step iv: H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent) - perhaps reduce the diazonium salt to something else, like a methyl group. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to substitute the diazonium salt.

Wait, H3PO2 is usually used for reducing nitro groups to amines, but in some cases, it can be used for other reductions.

Wait, perhaps after steps i to iv, the ring has a substituent that's a good director for the next steps.

But this is getting too complicated.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The correct sequence must involve acetylation early, before deactivating groups are added. So, Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) is step i.

Then, nitration (HNO3) would add nitro in the meta position relative to acetyl. Then, bromination would go meta to nitro.

Wait, but acetylation is step i, then bromination (step ii) would add Br meta to acetyl.

Then nitration (step iii) would add nitro meta to acetyl and Br.

But in the target, nitro is at 5. Let me see.

So, if acetylation is first (position 1), bromination adds Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl), then nitration adds nitro where? It's influenced by both acetyl and Br.

Acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para.

So, the nitro might go to position 5, which is meta to acetyl (1) and para to Br (3). Because position 5 is meta to 1 and para to 3.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Acetophenone (1).

2. Br adds at 3.

3. Nitro adds at 5.

So, the order is: acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back at the options, which option does this?

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br adds at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro adds at 5.

Then, steps iv to vii are perhaps further reactions, but in the target, we only need three substituents. But the options have more steps.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which would have the acetyl, Br, and nitro substituents. So, perhaps the option that includes these steps is the correct one.

Looking at option B: steps are Br, nitro, acylation. No, that doesn't fit.

Option A's steps: acylation, bromination, nitration. So, after step iii, we have the correct substituents. But the option continues with other steps, which may be unnecessary or perhaps part of the process.

But the question is about the sequence that would lead to the target, regardless of extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is achieved after steps i, ii, iii in option A, but the subsequent steps are for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, the target requires three substituents: acetyl, Br, nitro. So, the correct sequence must include these three steps in the right order, with the correct directing.

So, the sequence must be:

1. Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3).

2. Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) → Br meta to acetyl.

3. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → nitro added meta to acetyl and para to Br, which is position 5.

So, the correct option must have these three steps in this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So, after these three steps, the substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). Which matches the target.

So, in option A, the first three steps achieve the correct substituents. Any subsequent steps (iv to vii) would be extra, but perhaps they don't affect the structure further, or they might be part of another process. But the question is about the sequence that leads to the target, so perhaps option A is the correct answer.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro groups) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has the acetyl group at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5, all of which are meta to each other.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with FeBr3 adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group and para to the bromine).  
   After these three steps, the benzene ring has the correct substituents in the desired positions. The subsequent steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary for achieving the target molecule but may represent additional transformations.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (para to bromine).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro and bromine groups, making it impossible to introduce the acetyl group.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose but likely involves reduction or another transformation.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose but may involve reduction or another transformation.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and reduction with H3PO2 are typically used for introducing substituents via diazonium salts, but the sequence does not align with the desired substitution pattern.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is provided in **Option A**, where the acetyl group is introduced first, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This ensures that the substituents are added in the correct meta positions relative to each other. The subsequent steps in Option A are unnecessary for achieving the target molecule but do not interfere with its formation.
