Okay, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given chemical reactions. Hmm, let's start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. That's a lot of B reacting with A. Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen or something like that. Oh wait, bright red product—could it be something like copper(II) sulfate? Or maybe something else. Let me think.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, gases reacting with a solid. Maybe D is a halogen too, but I'm not sure yet.

Another clue: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Strong acids include like HCl, H2SO4, etc. If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl and G is H2SO3 or something else. Wait, but when a compound reacts with water, maybe it's undergoing hydrolysis. For example, if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4, reacting with water would give Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4? Or maybe sulfuric acid and another acid?

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents include things like H2O, ethanol, maybe something else. If B and D are gases, perhaps they're H2 and Cl2? No, but their reaction would form HCl, which is a gas but not a solvent. Or maybe CO2 and another gas? Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2? Because Cl2 and H2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Or perhaps B is O2 and D is H2; their reaction forms H2O, which is a solvent. That could make sense. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O.

But wait, earlier, B is reacting with A in a 8:1 ratio. A is solid. If B is O2, maybe A is something like copper reacting with O2. Let's see: 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. Oh, but the ratio here would be 2 moles of Cu to 1 mole of O2. So if the reaction is 8 equivalents of B (O2), then the equation would be Cu (solid) + O2 → CuO. Let's see, the ratio would be 2 Cu : 1 O2. So 8 equivalents of O2 would require 16 equivalents of Cu. But the product is C. So C is probably CuO.

Wait, but copper oxide is black, not bright red. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. What else gives a bright red product when formed? Oh, maybe it's silver oxide? No, silver oxide is black as well. Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, maybe it's lead dioxide? But that's dark brown. Or maybe it's a different kind of compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur reacting with something.

Wait, maybe A is iron. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Wait, but iron(III) oxide is Fe2O3, which is reddish. So if Fe reacts with O2 (B) to form Fe2O3 (C), which is bright red. Then, when C reacts with water, it would form Fe(OH)3 and maybe some acid? But wait, Fe(OH)3 is not an acid. Hmm, maybe this line of thinking is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound. Let's think again. The reaction where C is formed from A and B with 8 equivalents. So the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B → C. If B is a diatomic gas, like O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles. So the reaction would be A + 8 B → C.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal and B is O2? Let's say A is copper. Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO. The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. So here, 2 moles of Cu react with 1 mole of O2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. So the reaction would be Cu + 4 O2 → 2 CuO? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is another metal. Let me think. What metal reacts in a 1:8 ratio with O2?

Alternatively, maybe B is not O2. Could B be Cl2? Then A reacts with Cl2 to form C. For example, Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. The reaction is 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl2. So 2 moles of Cu with 1 mole of Cl2. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B, so perhaps the ratio is 1 A :8 B. Let's see: 1 A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2, then 8 Cl2 would require A in a way that the formula of C is ACl8. Hmm, that seems unusual. Maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is another diatomic gas, like F2. But then, A would react with F2 to form a fluoride. Let's say A is sodium. 2 Na + F2 → 2 NaF. So 2 Na:1 F2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B, so maybe 4 F2 reacting with 2 A? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids F and G. So, C → A + F + G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid.

Suppose C is a salt. For example, say C is CuSO4. Then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Cu²+ and SO4^2- ions. But that alone would not produce acids. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfate, and when it reacts with water, it undergoes hydrolysis. For example, CuSO4 + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2SO4. But wait, that would produce H2SO4 (a strong acid) and Cu(OH)2 (a base, which then could react further). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into HNO3 and another acid.

Wait, let's think about the reaction producing two acids. So C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which when reacts with water can hydrolyze into NaHCO3 and H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak), but that might not fit. Alternatively, another example: maybe C is a sulfite, which upon hydrolysis produces H2SO3 (weak) and H2S (but that's a gas, not an acid in solution). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfate. For example, when CuSO4 reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 (which is a base) and H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid (F) and maybe another product, but I'm not sure where G comes from. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Wait, let's think of nitrate salts. For example, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) when reacted with water (maybe under certain conditions) can hydrolyze into HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid? Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids because C is a different kind of compound. Let me think of a compound that when dissolved in water produces two acids. Wait, maybe it's a metal carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water and can hydrolyze into sodium bicarbonate and carbonic acid. But that's one strong and one weak acid? Wait, no, sodium bicarbonate is a weak acid in solution, I think. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. When sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid.

Wait, but the problem says that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So in the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G, F is strong, G is weak.

So perhaps C is a sulfite, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid? Or maybe C is a bisulfate or something else. Another possibility: C could be a salt of a diprotic acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which when dissolved in water dissociates into Na+, HSO4^-, and H+ (from HSO4^- acting as an acid). Wait, but that's not two acids, just a salt and a strong acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid (F), and perhaps another product. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D (gas) to form E, and D is used in a reaction with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent). So D + B → H. H is a solvent, so it's likely a common solvent like H2O, ethanol, etc.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So B is O2, D is H2. So their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

So, going back, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2), it produces E. So C + 2 H2 → E.

What would that reaction be? Maybe a reduction? For example, if C is a metal oxide reacting with hydrogen gas. Like CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But then E would be copper and water. But E is a product, so maybe E is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, and D is H2. For instance, CuSO4 reacts with H2 to form Cu and H2SO4. So E would be H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, which might be F or G from another reaction.

Wait, but earlier, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. So if C is CuSO4, then reacting with water gives Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. So F is H2SO4 (strong acid), and perhaps G is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then when C reacts with H2 (2 equivalents), it's CuSO4 + H2 → Cu + H2SO4. So E is H2SO4. Then, the symmetry group of H2SO4. Hmm.

Sulfuric acid has the formula H2SO4. The structure of H2SO4 has a central S with four O's. The molecule is tetrahedral around the sulfur, but in the gas phase, it's a trigonal pyramidal molecule. But when it's in the solid state (crystalline), it has a certain symmetry. Wait, but the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E, which would be H2SO4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to tie all these together. Let's make a list of possible compounds based on the reactions.

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

From point 4: B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let me think of possible B and D combinations. Let's consider possible solvents: H2O, ethanol, methanol, etc.

If H is H2O, then B and D would be O2 and H2. Because H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. Wait, but point 4 says 1:1 ratio. So 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2. So that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, maybe another reaction. For example, CO2 and H2O? No, that's not a reaction. Alternatively, maybe if B is Cl2 and D is H2, but their reaction is H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl, which is a 1:1 ratio (1 mole H2 + 1 mole Cl2 → 2 moles HCl). So that would fit. So H is HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, but H is used as a solvent. Hmm, maybe not that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon), but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's think about other possibilities.

Another approach: Let's say H is ethanol. Then, what would B and D be? For example, if B is O2 and D is C (carbon), then CO2 + H2O → ethanol. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas too.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. Let's think again. If B is O2 and D is H2, their ratio is 2:1 to form H2O. But the problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps it's another reaction. For example, maybe B is F2 and D is H2, but then H would be HF, which is a gas and not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is O3 (ozone) and D is O2. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NaOH, but that would produce NaCl and NaClO, which isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between CO2 and H2O to form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe H is NH3. Then, B and D would be N2 and H2, which react to form NH3. The reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is a 1:3 ratio. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH4. Then, B and D would need to react to form CH4. For example, CO + H2 → CH4. But that's a 1: H2 ratio of 1:1? Not sure.

This part is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should reorient and focus on product E. E is extremely hazardous. Common extremely hazardous chemicals include things like sarin gas, hydrogen cyanide, but perhaps more relevant to the problem, maybe something like mustard gas or another toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps it's a strong acid or a strong base, but the problem says E is produced from C reacting with 2 equivalents of D.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If D is H2, then E could be a metal, like in the reduction of a metal oxide. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. So E would be Cu and H2O. But E is a product, but how would that be extremely hazardous? Copper is not extremely hazardous, unless in certain forms.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas. Let's say C is a sulfate, and D is H2. Then, maybe C is Fe2(SO4)3. Fe2(SO4)3 + H2 → Fe + H2SO4. So E would be Fe and H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, which is F in another reaction. Wait, but if E is a product, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but I'm not sure how that would form from C and H2.

Wait, let's think of E as a compound with a specific symmetry. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all symmetry groups from crystallography or molecular symmetry.

For example, D∞h symmetry is common in linear molecules with an infinite number of twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis, like CO2 (which is linear, but O=C=O has D∞h symmetry). Wait, but CO2 has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but wait, another example: H2O has a C2v symmetry. The structure of water is bent, with a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. So its symmetry group is C2v.

But E's symmetry depends on what E is. Let's suppose E is H2O. But earlier, H is a solvent, which could be H2O. But when C reacts with D (H2) to form E, if E is H2O, then that reaction would be C + H2 → H2O. But that doesn't make much sense, unless C is a metal oxide. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. So E is H2O, which is a solvent, but in that case, E is H2O. But H2O's symmetry is C2v. Wait, but the question is about E's symmetry, not H's.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of E. If E is a linear molecule, it's likely to have D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 has D∞h. If E is a molecule like H2O, that's bent, so C2v. If E is something like CH4, which is tetrahedral, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a compound like Cl2, but that's a diatomic gas, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but in the reaction C + 2 D → E, if D is H2, then E could be HCl (if C is Cl2, which doesn't fit the earlier reactions). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Another angle: Let's go back to the first reaction. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (bright red). If A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe might form FeO, but FeO is not bright red. Fe2O3 is reddish. So if A is Fe and B is O2, the reaction could be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So 4 Fe react with 3 O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. So 8 O2 would require more Fe.

Wait, the problem says 8 equivalents of B. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. So the reaction is A + 8 B → C.

If B is O2, then the formula would be A + 8 O2 → C. For example, if A is S (sulfur), then 8 O2 would produce SO8? No, that's not a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Then, A + 8 Cl2 → C. For example, if A is Na, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 2 Na and 1 Cl2. But in the problem, 8 Cl2 would react with 4 A, but the ratio is 1 A :8 B. So 1 A + 8 Cl2 → C. That would make C as ACl8. But I'm not sure what metal would form a +8 oxidation state. That's probably impossible.

Hmm, maybe B is not O2 or Cl2. What other diatomic gases are there? Maybe N2, but it's inert. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possible structure of E. The options given are symmetry groups, so perhaps E is a molecule with one of these symmetries.

Option C is D∞h, which is linear molecules like CO2, HCN, etc. Option A is C2, which is a two-fold rotation axis. Option D is C2v, which is like water or H2S. Option B is D4h, which is a higher symmetry, like in some polyatomic ions or molecules.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, C2v. If E is something like H2O, symmetry C2v.

But let's get back to the reactions.

Let me try to make a table of possible compounds.

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red).
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous).
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
4. B + D → H (solvent, 1:1).

Assuming H is a solvent, let's say H is H2O. Then, B + D → H2O. So B and D would be O2 and H2, but their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, if H is another solvent, like ethanol (C2H5OH). But how would B and D react to form ethanol? That's tricky because ethanol synthesis typically requires catalysts and isn't a direct 1:1 reaction.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, B and D would need to form NH3. For example, if B is N2 and D is H2: N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is F2. F2 is a diatomic gas. Then, B + D = F2 + O2 → ? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is O3 (ozone) and D is O2. O3 + O2 → O something? Not sure.

Another angle: perhaps B is a diatomic gas, and D is a diatomic gas as well. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Let's think of possible diatomic gases that can react in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, H2O is a solvent. How can two diatomic gases react to form H2O? 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's again a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O. But D is a gas, and H2O is a liquid or gas. Wait, but if D is H2O (as a gas), then B + D → H is O2 + H2O → what? Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe H is H2O but that requires B and D to be H2 and O2, but their ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2. But that's the reverse of the formation reaction. Not helpful.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of each reaction again.

From reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So C must be a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which can dissociate into H+ and SO4^2- (F is H2SO4, a strong acid) and maybe another acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When Na2SO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into 2 NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid (so G), and NaOH is a base, but that doesn't produce A as a solid. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another example: if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. It can hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but NaOH is a base. Then, perhaps that doesn't fit F and G.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate of a metal that hydrolyzes into a strong acid and another acid. For example, if C is CuSO4, then when it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid) and G would be something else. But where does G come from? Alternatively, perhaps when C is a mixture of ions, like in a double decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that releases two different acids upon reaction with water. For example, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid (F), and what about G? Maybe if there's another acid formed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to form sodium bicarbonate and carbonic acid. So F is H2CO3 (weak acid) but wait, that's not correct as H2CO3 is weak. But the problem states F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, sodium sulfonate (R-SO3Na) can hydrolyze into R-SO3H (a strong acid, sulfonic acid) and NaOH. But that doesn't produce two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible products.

If C is a sulfate (like CuSO4), then reacting with water gives Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. So F is H2SO4 (strong), and G is not present. But the question says two different acids. So perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, what about if C is a salt that can release two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is a phosphate. Let's say C is (NH4)3PO4. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NH4OH (a weak acid) and H3PO4 (a weak acid as well). But that doesn't fit because both would be weak.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt, like sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4). When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+, HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid, releasing H+ and SO4^2-. So in solution, you'd have H+ (from HSO4^-) and SO4^2- (from NaHSO4). But that's only producing one acid, H2SO4, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, some kind of acid anhydride. Maybe something like (H2SO4)(H2SO3), but I'm not sure if such a compound exists.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Let's say C is CuSO3. CuSO3 + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid (G), and maybe another component. But that doesn't give a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate hydroxide. For example, CuCO3·Cu(OH)2. When it reacts with water, it might produce Cu(OH)2 (a base) and CO2 (a weak acid). But that still doesn't give two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think of another approach. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is KNO3. KNO3 + H2O → KNO3 (doesn't hydrolyze). So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate, but again, it's not giving two acids.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about decomposition. For example, C could be a mixed salt that decomposes into two acids. For instance, perhaps C is a metal sulfite and a carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on and consider the reactions from another angle. Let's think about E. E is formed when C reacts with 2 D. If D is H2, and E is a gas, perhaps E is HCl. But how would C react with H2 to form HCl? That would require C to be Cl2, but then earlier reactions would have to fit.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2 and E is HCl, then C would be H2. But that doesn't fit with the earlier reactions.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. To form HCN, you'd need C to be CN- and D to be H+. But that doesn't fit with the reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas with a high symmetry. If E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, that's one of the options.

Wait, but how would CO2 form from C and D? Let's think. If C is CaCO3, and D is something that would react with it. But CaCO3 is a solid, not a bright red product.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, let's think about the symmetry of E. The options include D∞h, which is a high symmetry group, typically for linear molecules. So E might be a linear molecule like CO2, HCN, etc.

If E is CO2, then D would have to be O2, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule. For example, Cl2 has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a diatomic gas, but how would that form from C and D?

Wait, perhaps E is O2. But O2 is a diatomic gas with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but O2 is formed from reactions involving O, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should make assumptions based on the options and the likely reactions.

If E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, that would correspond to option C: D∞h.

But how would that fit into the reactions? Let's see.

If E is CO2, then C + 2 D → CO2.

If D is H2, then C would have to be something that reacts with H2 to produce CO2. For example, maybe C is a carbonate.

Wait, but then earlier reactions would have to fit. Let's say C is CaCO3. Then, CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But that's not matching the 2 equivalents of D. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrocarbon that burns to produce CO2. But that's a stretch.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for another angle.

Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with 2 D to form E. If E is a gas and extremely hazardous, perhaps E is HCl gas. So C + 2 H2 → HCl. But HCl is formed from H2 and Cl2. So if D is Cl2, then C would have to be H2. But that doesn't fit with the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas. If C is a sulfite and D is O2, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, and D is a diatomic gas. Let's say D is Cl2. Then, C + 2 Cl2 → E.

If E is HCl, then C would be H2. But that doesn't fit other reactions.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HClO, but that's not extremely hazardous in large quantities but can be toxic.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like H2S, which is toxic. If C is a sulfide and D is H2, then C + H2 → H2S. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound with a high symmetry group, which would be D∞h. So the answer could be option C: D∞h.

Wait, but without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to say. But given the options and the fact that D∞h is a common symmetry for linear molecules, which are often gases, I might lean towards E being a linear molecule, giving it D∞h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a metal oxide or a related compound. However, common red oxides like CuO or Fe2O3 were considered but did not fully align with subsequent reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is likely a toxic gas or highly reactive compound. Possible candidates for E include CO2, HCl, SO2, or HCN, though the exact identity remains unclear.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, if C were a sulfate or sulfite, it could produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents include H2O or ethanol. If H is H2O, B and D could be O2 and H2, but their reaction ratio (2:1) does not match the 1:1 requirement. Other solvents like ethanol or NH3 were considered but did not fully fit the constraints.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecular symmetry group of E depends on its structure. The options provided are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A higher symmetry group with multiple planes and axes.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules like CO2 or HCN.
   - **C2v**: Symmetry of bent molecules like H2O.

   Given that E is described as extremely hazardous and likely a gas, a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry is plausible. For example, CO2 or HCN has this symmetry, aligning with the description of E.

Based on the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule. 

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given chemical reactions. Hmm, let's start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. That's a lot of B reacting with A. Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen or something like that. Oh wait, bright red product—could it be something like copper(II) sulfate? Or maybe something else. Let me think.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, gases reacting with a solid. Maybe D is a halogen too, but I'm not sure yet.

Another clue: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Strong acids include like HCl, H2SO4, etc. If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl and G is H2SO3 or something else. Wait, but when a compound reacts with water, maybe it's undergoing hydrolysis. For example, if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4, reacting with water would give Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4? Or maybe sulfuric acid and another acid?

Wait, another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents include things like H2O, ethanol, maybe something else. If B and D are gases, perhaps they're H2 and Cl2? No, but their reaction would form HCl, which is a gas but not a solvent. Or maybe CO2 and another gas? Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2? Because Cl2 and H2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Or perhaps B is O2 and D is H2; their reaction forms H2O, which is a solvent. That could make sense. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O.

But wait, earlier, B is reacting with A in a 8:1 ratio. A is solid. If B is O2, maybe A is something like copper reacting with O2. Let's see: 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. Oh, but the ratio here would be 2 moles of Cu to 1 mole of O2. So if the reaction is 8 equivalents of B (O2), then the equation would be Cu (solid) + O2 → CuO. Let's see, the ratio would be 2 Cu : 1 O2. So 8 equivalents of O2 would require 16 equivalents of Cu. But the product is C. So C is probably CuO.

Wait, but copper oxide is black, not bright red. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. What else gives a bright red product when formed? Oh, maybe it's silver oxide? No, silver oxide is black as well. Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, maybe it's lead dioxide? But that's dark brown. Or maybe it's a different kind of compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur reacting with something.

Wait, maybe A is iron. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Wait, but iron(III) oxide is Fe2O3, which is reddish. So if Fe reacts with O2 (B) to form Fe2O3 (C), which is bright red. Then, when C reacts with water, it would form Fe(OH)3 and maybe some acid? But wait, Fe(OH)3 is not an acid. Hmm, maybe this line of thinking is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound. Let's think again. The reaction where C is formed from A and B with 8 equivalents. So the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B → C. If B is a diatomic gas, like O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles. So the reaction would be A + 8 B → C.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal and B is O2? Let's say A is copper. Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO. The reaction is 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. So here, 2 moles of Cu react with 1 mole of O2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. So the reaction would be Cu + 4 O2 → 2 CuO? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is another metal. Let me think. What metal reacts in a 1:8 ratio with O2?

Alternatively, maybe B is not O2. Could B be Cl2? Then A reacts with Cl2 to form C. For example, Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. The reaction is 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl2. So 2 moles of Cu with 1 mole of Cl2. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B, so perhaps the ratio is 1 A :8 B. Let's see: 1 A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2, then 8 Cl2 would require A in a way that the formula of C is ACl8. Hmm, that seems unusual. Maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is another diatomic gas, like F2. But then, A would react with F2 to form a fluoride. Let's say A is sodium. 2 Na + F2 → 2 NaF. So 2 Na:1 F2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B, so maybe 4 F2 reacting with 2 A? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids F and G. So, C → A + F + G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid.

Suppose C is a salt. For example, say C is CuSO4. Then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Cu²+ and SO4^2- ions. But that alone would not produce acids. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfate, and when it reacts with water, it undergoes hydrolysis. For example, CuSO4 + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2SO4. But wait, that would produce H2SO4 (a strong acid) and Cu(OH)2 (a base, which then could react further). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into HNO3 and another acid.

Wait, let's think about the reaction producing two acids. So C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which when reacts with water can hydrolyze into NaHCO3 and H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak), but that might not fit. Alternatively, another example: maybe C is a sulfite, which upon hydrolysis produces H2SO3 (weak) and H2S (but that's a gas, not an acid in solution). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfate. For example, when CuSO4 reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 (which is a base) and H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid (F) and maybe another product, but I'm not sure where G comes from. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Wait, let's think of nitrate salts. For example, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) when reacted with water (maybe under certain conditions) can hydrolyze into HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid? Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids because C is a different kind of compound. Let me think of a compound that when dissolved in water produces two acids. Wait, maybe it's a metal carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water and can hydrolyze into sodium bicarbonate and carbonic acid. But that's one strong and one weak acid? Wait, no, sodium bicarbonate is a weak acid in solution, I think. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. When sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid.

Wait, but the problem says that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So in the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G, F is strong, G is weak.

So perhaps C is a sulfite, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid? Or maybe C is a bisulfate or something else. Another possibility: C could be a salt of a diprotic acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which when dissolved in water dissociates into Na+, HSO4^-, and H+ (from HSO4^- acting as an acid). Wait, but that's not two acids, just a salt and a strong acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid (F), and perhaps another product. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D (gas) to form E, and D is used in a reaction with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent). So D + B → H. H is a solvent, so it's likely a common solvent like H2O, ethanol, etc.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So B is O2, D is H2. So their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

So, going back, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2), it produces E. So C + 2 H2 → E.

What would that reaction be? Maybe a reduction? For example, if C is a metal oxide reacting with hydrogen gas. Like CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But then E would be copper and water. But E is a product, so maybe E is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, and D is H2. For instance, CuSO4 reacts with H2 to form Cu and H2SO4. So E would be H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, which might be F or G from another reaction.

Wait, but earlier, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. So if C is CuSO4, then reacting with water gives Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. So F is H2SO4 (strong acid), and perhaps G is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then when C reacts with H2 (2 equivalents), it's CuSO4 + H2 → Cu + H2SO4. So E is H2SO4. Then, the symmetry group of H2SO4. Hmm.

Sulfuric acid has the formula H2SO4. The structure of H2SO4 has a central S with four O's. The molecule is tetrahedral around the sulfur, but in the gas phase, it's a trigonal pyramidal molecule. But when it's in the solid state (crystalline), it has a certain symmetry. Wait, but the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E, which would be H2SO4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to tie all these together. Let's make a list of possible compounds based on the reactions.

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

From point 4: B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let me think of possible B and D combinations. Let's consider possible solvents: H2O, ethanol, methanol, etc.

If H is H2O, then B and D would be O2 and H2. Because H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. Wait, but point 4 says 1:1 ratio. So 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2. So that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, maybe another reaction. For example, CO2 and H2O? No, that's not a reaction. Alternatively, maybe if B is Cl2 and D is H2, but their reaction is H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl, which is a 1:1 ratio (1 mole H2 + 1 mole Cl2 → 2 moles HCl). So that would fit. So H is HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, but H is used as a solvent. Hmm, maybe not that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon), but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's think about other possibilities.

Another approach: Let's say H is ethanol. Then, what would B and D be? For example, if B is O2 and D is C (carbon), then CO2 + H2O → ethanol. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas too.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. Let's think again. If B is O2 and D is H2, their ratio is 2:1 to form H2O. But the problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps it's another reaction. For example, maybe B is F2 and D is H2, but then H would be HF, which is a gas and not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is O3 (ozone) and D is O2. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NaOH, but that would produce NaCl and NaClO, which isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between CO2 and H2O to form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe H is NH3. Then, B and D would be N2 and H2, which react to form NH3. The reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is a 1:3 ratio. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH4. Then, B and D would need to react to form CH4. For example, CO + H2 → CH4. But that's a 1: H2 ratio of 1:1? Not sure.

This part is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should reorient and focus on product E. E is extremely hazardous. Common extremely hazardous chemicals include things like sarin gas, hydrogen cyanide, but perhaps more relevant to the problem, maybe something like mustard gas or another toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps it's a strong acid or a strong base, but the problem says E is produced from C reacting with 2 equivalents of D.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If D is H2, then E could be a metal, like in the reduction of a metal oxide. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. So E would be Cu and H2O. But E is a product, but how would that be extremely hazardous? Copper is not extremely hazardous, unless in certain forms.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas. Let's say C is a sulfate, and D is H2. Then, maybe C is Fe2(SO4)3. Fe2(SO4)3 + H2 → Fe + H2SO4. So E would be Fe and H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, which is F in another reaction. Wait, but if E is a product, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but I'm not sure how that would form from C and H2.

Wait, let's think of E as a compound with a specific symmetry. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all symmetry groups from crystallography or molecular symmetry.

For example, D∞h symmetry is common in linear molecules with an infinite number of twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis, like CO2 (which is linear, but O=C=O has D∞h symmetry). Wait, but CO2 has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but wait, another example: H2O has a C2v symmetry. The structure of water is bent, with a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. So its symmetry group is C2v.

But E's symmetry depends on what E is. Let's suppose E is H2O. But earlier, H is a solvent, which could be H2O. But when C reacts with D (H2) to form E, if E is H2O, then that reaction would be C + H2 → H2O. But that doesn't make much sense, unless C is a metal oxide. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. So E is H2O, which is a solvent, but in that case, E is H2O. But H2O's symmetry is C2v. Wait, but the question is about E's symmetry, not H's.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of E. If E is a linear molecule, it's likely to have D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 has D∞h. If E is a molecule like H2O, that's bent, so C2v. If E is something like CH4, which is tetrahedral, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a compound like Cl2, but that's a diatomic gas, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but in the reaction C + 2 D → E, if D is H2, then E could be HCl (if C is Cl2, which doesn't fit the earlier reactions). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Another angle: Let's go back to the first reaction. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (bright red). If A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe might form FeO, but FeO is not bright red. Fe2O3 is reddish. So if A is Fe and B is O2, the reaction could be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So 4 Fe react with 3 O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. So 8 O2 would require more Fe.

Wait, the problem says 8 equivalents of B. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. So the reaction is A + 8 B → C.

If B is O2, then the formula would be A + 8 O2 → C. For example, if A is S (sulfur), then 8 O2 would produce SO8? No, that's not a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Then, A + 8 Cl2 → C. For example, if A is Na, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 2 Na and 1 Cl2. But in the problem, 8 Cl2 would react with 4 A, but the ratio is 1 A :8 B. So 1 A + 8 Cl2 → C. That would make C as ACl8. But I'm not sure what metal would form a +8 oxidation state. That's probably impossible.

Hmm, maybe B is not O2 or Cl2. What other diatomic gases are there? Maybe N2, but it's inert. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possible structure of E. The options given are symmetry groups, so perhaps E is a molecule with one of these symmetries.

Option C is D∞h, which is linear molecules like CO2, HCN, etc. Option A is C2, which is a two-fold rotation axis. Option D is C2v, which is like water or H2S. Option B is D4h, which is a higher symmetry, like in some polyatomic ions or molecules.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, C2v. If E is something like H2O, symmetry C2v.

But let's get back to the reactions.

Let me try to make a table of possible compounds.

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red).
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous).
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
4. B + D → H (solvent, 1:1).

Assuming H is a solvent, let's say H is H2O. Then, B + D → H2O. So B and D would be O2 and H2, but their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, if H is another solvent, like ethanol (C2H5OH). But how would B and D react to form ethanol? That's tricky because ethanol synthesis typically requires catalysts and isn't a direct 1:1 reaction.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, B and D would need to form NH3. For example, if B is N2 and D is H2: N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is F2. F2 is a diatomic gas. Then, B + D = F2 + O2 → ? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is O3 (ozone) and D is O2. O3 + O2 → O something? Not sure.

Another angle: perhaps B is a diatomic gas, and D is a diatomic gas as well. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Let's think of possible diatomic gases that can react in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, H2O is a solvent. How can two diatomic gases react to form H2O? 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's again a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O. But D is a gas, and H2O is a liquid or gas. Wait, but if D is H2O (as a gas), then B + D → H is O2 + H2O → what? Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe H is H2O but that requires B and D to be H2 and O2, but their ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2. But that's the reverse of the formation reaction. Not helpful.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of each reaction again.

From reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So C must be a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which can dissociate into H+ and SO4^2- (F is H2SO4, a strong acid) and maybe another acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When Na2SO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into 2 NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid (so G), and NaOH is a base, but that doesn't produce A as a solid. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another example: if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. It can hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but NaOH is a base. Then, perhaps that doesn't fit F and G.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate of a metal that hydrolyzes into a strong acid and another acid. For example, if C is CuSO4, then when it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid) and G would be something else. But where does G come from? Alternatively, perhaps when C is a mixture of ions, like in a double decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that releases two different acids upon reaction with water. For example, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid (F), and what about G? Maybe if there's another acid formed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to form sodium bicarbonate and carbonic acid. So F is H2CO3 (weak acid) but wait, that's not correct as H2CO3 is weak. But the problem states F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, sodium sulfonate (R-SO3Na) can hydrolyze into R-SO3H (a strong acid, sulfonic acid) and NaOH. But that doesn't produce two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible products.

If C is a sulfate (like CuSO4), then reacting with water gives Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. So F is H2SO4 (strong), and G is not present. But the question says two different acids. So perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, what about if C is a salt that can release two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is a phosphate. Let's say C is (NH4)3PO4. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NH4OH (a weak acid) and H3PO4 (a weak acid as well). But that doesn't fit because both would be weak.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt, like sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4). When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+, HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid, releasing H+ and SO4^2-. So in solution, you'd have H+ (from HSO4^-) and SO4^2- (from NaHSO4). But that's only producing one acid, H2SO4, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, some kind of acid anhydride. Maybe something like (H2SO4)(H2SO3), but I'm not sure if such a compound exists.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Let's say C is CuSO3. CuSO3 + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid (G), and maybe another component. But that doesn't give a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate hydroxide. For example, CuCO3·Cu(OH)2. When it reacts with water, it might produce Cu(OH)2 (a base) and CO2 (a weak acid). But that still doesn't give two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think of another approach. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is KNO3. KNO3 + H2O → KNO3 (doesn't hydrolyze). So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate, but again, it's not giving two acids.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about decomposition. For example, C could be a mixed salt that decomposes into two acids. For instance, perhaps C is a metal sulfite and a carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on and consider the reactions from another angle. Let's think about E. E is formed when C reacts with 2 D. If D is H2, and E is a gas, perhaps E is HCl. But how would C react with H2 to form HCl? That would require C to be Cl2, but then earlier reactions would have to fit.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2 and E is HCl, then C would be H2. But that doesn't fit with the earlier reactions.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. To form HCN, you'd need C to be CN- and D to be H+. But that doesn't fit with the reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas with a high symmetry. If E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, that's one of the options.

Wait, but how would CO2 form from C and D? Let's think. If C is CaCO3, and D is something that would react with it. But CaCO3 is a solid, not a bright red product.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, let's think about the symmetry of E. The options include D∞h, which is a high symmetry group, typically for linear molecules. So E might be a linear molecule like CO2, HCN, etc.

If E is CO2, then D would have to be O2, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule. For example, Cl2 has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a diatomic gas, but how would that form from C and D?

Wait, perhaps E is O2. But O2 is a diatomic gas with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but O2 is formed from reactions involving O, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should make assumptions based on the options and the likely reactions.

If E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, that would correspond to option C: D∞h.

But how would that fit into the reactions? Let's see.

If E is CO2, then C + 2 D → CO2.

If D is H2, then C would have to be something that reacts with H2 to produce CO2. For example, maybe C is a carbonate.

Wait, but then earlier reactions would have to fit. Let's say C is CaCO3. Then, CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But that's not matching the 2 equivalents of D. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrocarbon that burns to produce CO2. But that's a stretch.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for another angle.

Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with 2 D to form E. If E is a gas and extremely hazardous, perhaps E is HCl gas. So C + 2 H2 → HCl. But HCl is formed from H2 and Cl2. So if D is Cl2, then C would have to be H2. But that doesn't fit with the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas. If C is a sulfite and D is O2, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, and D is a diatomic gas. Let's say D is Cl2. Then, C + 2 Cl2 → E.

If E is HCl, then C would be H2. But that doesn't fit other reactions.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HClO, but that's not extremely hazardous in large quantities but can be toxic.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like H2S, which is toxic. If C is a sulfide and D is H2, then C + H2 → H2S. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound with a high symmetry group, which would be D∞h. So the answer could be option C: D∞h.

Wait, but without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to say. But given the options and the fact that D∞h is a common symmetry for linear molecules, which are often gases, I might lean towards E being a linear molecule, giving it D∞h symmetry.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a metal oxide or a related compound. However, common red oxides like CuO or Fe2O3 were considered but did not fully align with subsequent reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is likely a toxic gas or highly reactive compound. Possible candidates for E include CO2, HCl, SO2, or HCN, though the exact identity remains unclear.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, if C were a sulfate or sulfite, it could produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents include H2O or ethanol. If H is H2O, B and D could be O2 and H2, but their reaction ratio (2:1) does not match the 1:1 requirement. Other solvents like ethanol or NH3 were considered but did not fully fit the constraints.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecular symmetry group of E depends on its structure. The options provided are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A higher symmetry group with multiple planes and axes.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules like CO2 or HCN.
   - **C2v**: Symmetry of bent molecules like H2O.

   Given that E is described as extremely hazardous and likely a gas, a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry is plausible. For example, CO2 or HCN has this symmetry, aligning with the description of E.

Based on the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule.
