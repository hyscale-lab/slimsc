Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to think through it carefully.

So, the problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, okay, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, some of these are strong acids or strong bases, and others are weak. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And HCl is a strong acid, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when they're mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the bases. The one with the higher moles will determine whether the solution is acidic or basic after neutralization.

Let me start by calculating each mole.

First, the acetic acid. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, in the presence of a strong acid or base, maybe it doesn't matter because the strong ones will dominate. Hmm, maybe I should treat the acetic acid as contributing some H+ but the HCl will contribute a lot more.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. The volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 liters. Molarity 0.2 M, so moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. So that's 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. The volume is 300 mL, 0.3 liters. Molarity 0.3 M, so moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the total OH- moles from it are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles. So that's 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, the total H+ comes from both the HCl and the acetic acid. But wait, the HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 moles of H+. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so it only contributes some H+. But when mixed with a strong base, maybe the strong base will overpower the weak acid? Or perhaps I should first calculate the net H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, the total H+ is the sum from HCl and CH3COOH. Let me compute that. The HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. The acetic acid gives 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't completely donate H+. So the actual H+ from acetic acid is less than 0.05. Hmm, but in the presence of a strong base, maybe the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize some of the H+ from both HCl and acetic acid. 

Wait, perhaps it's better to first figure out the total H+ and OH- in the mixture. Let me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH gives 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, but as a weak acid, it only dissociates partially. But perhaps in this case, since we have a strong base present, the OH- will react with all the H+ available. So perhaps the OH- will neutralize both the H+ from HCl and the CH3COOH.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of neutralization. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So let's compute the total H+:

HCl: 0.08 moles H+
CH3COOH: 0.05 moles CH3COOH (but only partially dissociates, but for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps we can treat it as 0.05 H+? Or is that incorrect?)

Wait, no. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it won't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. So when you mix HCl (strong) and CH3COOH (weak) with a strong base, the OH- will first react with the H+ from HCl, which is strong and fully dissociated. Then, any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from the weak acid.

So let's proceed step by step.

Total OH- available is 0.18 moles.

Total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

So the OH- will first react with HCl's H+: 0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 moles H2O. So that neutralizes all the HCl's H+.

Now, OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the acetic acid contributes 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. How much H+ does it contribute? Normally, you would need to consider the dissociation equilibrium, but perhaps in this case, after neutralization, the remaining OH- will react with any available H+ from the acetic acid.

But wait, the acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it would produce some H+ and acetate ions. But when you have excess OH-, that OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, no. Because OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from any source, including the weak acid. So the 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the H+ from the acetic acid.

But wait, the acetic acid initially contributes 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, which in solution can donate H+ as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

But the OH- will take those H+ ions. So perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So for each mole of OH-, it will take one mole of H+ from the acetic acid. So the 0.10 moles of OH- will react with 0.10 moles of H+ from the acetic acid.

But wait, the acetic acid only has 0.05 moles available. So all the OH- can't react with the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with all the H+ from the acetic acid (0.05 moles) and then have some left over.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

After neutralizing the HCl's H+, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. The acetic acid can provide 0.05 moles of H+ (if it dissociates completely, which it doesn't). But even in its weak state, perhaps the OH- can take the available H+.

Wait, perhaps the OH- will react with the acetic acid as follows:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH and produces one mole of CH3COO^-.

Since OH- is 0.10 moles, and CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, all the CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So now, after all reactions, the solution will have:

From OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles remaining.

So the total OH- is 0.05 moles in the solution.

Wait, but we also have to consider the total volume of the solution. The volumes add up: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, since OH- concentration is known, we can find pOH and then pH.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62, and option B is 1.38. Hmm. So according to this, the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Let me double-check.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Since each gives 2 OH-, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

So OH- is 0.18, HCl H+ is 0.08. So the OH- neutralizes all the HCl H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, the acetic acid is 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. So the OH- will react with the acetic acid. Each OH- can take one H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, but how much H+ does the acetic acid produce? It's a weak acid, so it doesn't release all 0.05 moles of H+. But the OH- will, in this case, take the H+ that the acetic acid can provide. So the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the OH- (0.10 moles) will react with 0.05 moles of acetic acid (since that's all that's available), producing 0.05 moles of acetate and using up all the acetic acid. So the OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, the OH- is 0.10 moles, and the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. So all the acetic acid is consumed, and 0.05 moles of OH- remains.

Thus, the solution's OH- concentration is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, which is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is log(1/(0.04167)) → wait, no, pOH is -log(0.04167). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.04167) is approximately log(4.167e-2) → log(4.167) is about 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which matches option A.

But wait, another way to think about it: Did I account for all the OH- and H+ correctly? Because sometimes in these problems, the weak acid's contribution isn't considered properly.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is correct. The OH- neutralizes all the HCl and then some of the acetic acid. The remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to a basic solution with pH around 12.62.

So the correct answer should be option A) 12.62.

To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each component:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.1 M  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes less H⁺ compared to a strong acid.

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Neutralization Reaction
The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH:

1. **Neutralization of HCl:**  
   OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio:  
   \[
   0.08 \, \text{moles H⁺} + 0.08 \, \text{moles OH⁻} \to 0.08 \, \text{moles H₂O}.
   \]  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization of CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   CH₃COOH has 0.05 moles, so all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH react with 0.05 moles of OH⁻.  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Final OH⁻ Concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH Calculation
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Total OH- available is 0.18 moles.

Total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

So the OH- will first react with HCl's H+: 0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 moles H2O. So that neutralizes all the HCl's H+.

Now, OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the acetic acid contributes 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. How much H+ does it contribute? Normally, you would need to consider the dissociation equilibrium, but perhaps in this case, after neutralization, the remaining OH- will react with any available H+ from the acetic acid.

But the OH- will take those H+ ions. So perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So for each mole of OH-, it will take one mole of H+ from the acetic acid. So the 0.10 moles of OH- will react with 0.10 moles of H+ from the acetic acid.

But wait, the acetic acid only has 0.05 moles available. So all the OH- can't react with the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with all the H+ from the acetic acid (0.05 moles) and then have some left over.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

After neutralizing the HCl's H+, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. The acetic acid can provide 0.05 moles of H+ (if it dissociates completely, which it doesn't). But even in its weak state, perhaps the OH- can take the available H+.

Wait, perhaps the OH- will react with the acetic acid as follows:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH and produces one mole of CH3COO^-.

Since OH- is 0.10 moles, and CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, all the CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So now, after all reactions, the solution will have:

From OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles remaining.

So the total OH- is 0.05 moles in the solution.

Wait, but we also have to consider the total volume of the solution. The volumes add up: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, since OH- concentration is known, we can find pOH and then pH.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62, and option B is 1.38. Hmm. So according to this, the pH would be around 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Let me double-check.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Since each gives 2 OH-, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

So OH- is 0.18, HCl H+ is 0.08. So the OH- neutralizes all the HCl H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, the acetic acid is 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. So the OH- will react with the acetic acid. Each OH- can take one H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, but how much H+ does the acetic acid produce? It's a weak acid, so it doesn't release all 0.05 moles of H+. But the OH- will, in this case, take the H+ that the acetic acid can provide. So the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the OH- (0.10 moles) will react with 0.05 moles of acetic acid (since that's all that's available), producing 0.05 moles of acetate and using up all the acetic acid. So the OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, the OH- is 0.10 moles, and the acetic acid is 0.05 moles. So all the acetic acid is consumed, and 0.05 moles of OH- remains.

Thus, the solution's OH- concentration is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, which is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is log(1/(0.04167)) → wait, no, pOH is -log(0.04167). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.04167) is approximately log(4.167e-2) → log(4.167) is about 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which matches option A.

But wait, another way to think about it: Did I account for all the OH- and H+ correctly? Because sometimes in these problems, the weak acid's contribution isn't considered properly.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is correct. The OH- neutralizes all the HCl and then some of the acetic acid. The remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, leading to a basic solution with pH around 12.62.

So the correct answer should be option A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each component:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.1 M  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes less H⁺ compared to a strong acid.

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Neutralization Reaction
The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ will neutralize the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH:

1. **Neutralization of HCl:**  
   OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio:  
   \[
   0.08 \, \text{moles H⁺} + 0.08 \, \text{moles OH⁻} \to 0.08 \, \text{moles H₂O}.
   \]  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization of CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   CH₃COOH has 0.05 moles, so all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH react with 0.05 moles of OH⁻.  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Final OH⁻ Concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH Calculation
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
