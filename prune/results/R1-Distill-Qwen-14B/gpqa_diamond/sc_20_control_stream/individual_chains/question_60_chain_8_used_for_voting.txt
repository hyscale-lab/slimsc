Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you're moving at a speed close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. So the astronaut's own time would be different from the time observed from Earth.

Wait, the question says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c, which is super close to the speed of light. So the gamma factor must be very large. Gamma is equal to 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Let me plug in the value. v is 0.99999987*c, so v² is approximately (0.99999987)^2 * c². Let me calculate 0.99999987 squared. Oh, wait, 0.99999987 is really close to 1. Let me think, 1 - 0.99999987 is 0.00000013. Wait, but wait, when I square 0.99999987, it's (1 - 0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00000013 + ...? Hmm, maybe a better approach is to note that 0.99999987 is so close to 1 that maybe I can approximate the gamma factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for v close to c. The expression under the square root, 1 - v²/c², becomes very small. Taking the square root of that would be about the same as sqrt(1 - (1 - 2*(1 - v²/c²))), but I might be getting confused here. Alternatively, when v is close to c, gamma is approximately equal to 1/(sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))) or something like that? Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 1 - v²/c². v is 0.99999987*c, so (v/c) is 0.99999987. So (v/c)^2 is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that: 0.99999987 squared. Well, 1 - 0.00000013 is 0.99999987. So (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. Thus, 1 - (v^2/c^2) ≈ 2.6e-7.

So the denominator under the square root is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's calculate sqrt(2.6e-7). 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 10^-7. The square root of 10^-7 is 10^-3.5 (because sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.16e-4). So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.09e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964.

Wait, that's a big gamma. So time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is the Earth time divided by gamma. Or wait, no, the Earth time would be the astronaut's time multiplied by gamma? Let me get that straight.

If the spaceship is moving at high speed relative to Earth, from Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock runs slower. So for Earth observers, the spaceship's clock ticks slower. But from the spaceship's perspective, Earth clocks are running slower. So if we're calculating how much time passes on the spaceship, we need to consider the Earth frame's time and then apply time dilation.

Wait, the problem is asking how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective. So the astronaut is in the spaceship's frame. So what is the distance to Earth in their frame?

Wait, from the spaceship's frame, the distance would be contracted. Because in the spaceship's frame, Earth is moving towards it at 0.99999987c. So the proper distance (Earth's frame) is probably L. Then, in the spaceship frame, the distance is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = L / gamma.

Wait, but how long is the distance in Earth's frame? Let's figure that out.

Assuming the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is D (from Earth's frame, perhaps about 160,000 light-years or something, but the exact number might not matter as the problem might not require it). But wait, the problem states that the spacecraft is designed to go to Earth, so let's assume the distance from their starting point to Earth is D as measured in Earth's frame.

Wait, but in the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. So D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma.

So the time experienced by the astronaut would be the contracted distance divided by the speed. So t = D' / v. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching them at speed v, and the distance is D' = D/gamma.

So t = (D / gamma) / v.

But D in Earth’s frame is the distance to Earth, but wait, the spacecraft is in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The average distance between the LMC and Earth is about 160,000 light-years. So D is approximately 160,000 ly.

Wait, but the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time in Earth's frame first and then apply time dilation.

Wait, from Earth's perspective, the time taken is T = D / v, because the spaceship is approaching at speed v. So T = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so dividing ly by c (ly is light-year, so ly/c is time in years). So T = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 ≈ 160,000 years. But wait, that's a huge number, but from Earth's perspective, the spaceship is taking 160,000 years to reach. But from the spaceship's perspective, the time would be less due to time dilation.

Wait, no, because the spaceship's time is their proper time, so the astronaut's experienced time would be T' = T / gamma, where T is the Earth time. Because in Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock is running slower. So T' = T / gamma.

Wait, wait. From Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock runs at a rate of 1/gamma per Earth year. So for each Earth year, the spaceship's clock advances 1/gamma years. So the time experienced by the astronaut is T' = T / gamma.

So putting it together, T = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 years (since 0.99999987 is almost 1).

So T ≈ 160,000 years.

Then, T' = T / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ let me compute that: 160,000 / 2000 is 80. But 1964 is a bit less than 2000, so 160,000 /1964 ≈ approx 81.25 years.

Wait, because 1964 * 80 = 157,120. 1964 * 81= 1964*80=157120 +1964= 159,084. 1964*81.25= 159,084 + 1964*(0.25)= 491. So 159,575. Still lower than 160,000. Let's compute 81.25 * 1964.

Wait, 81 * 1964 = let's compute 80 *1964=157,120, plus 1*1964=157,120+1964=159,084.

159,084 is 160,000 - 916. So 81 years would give T' = 81 years, with 160,000 - 81 *1964 = 160,000 - 159,084 = 916 years left. But 916 /1964 is about 0.466 years, which is about 5.6 months. So 81 + 0.466 is approximately 81.466 years.

But the astronaut is 22 years old. So 81 years later, he would be 22 +81=103 years old. Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years. So 103 is less than 150, so he would live long enough.

But wait, the options given are 72, 77, 81. So according to this, approximately 81 years.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the distance is not 160,000 ly but something else. Wait, the problem states that the spacecraft is going to Earth, but perhaps the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 ly. So that would be D.

So back to the calculation: T = D / v ≈ 160,000 years. T' = T / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 81.25 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So the answer would be option C) 81 years.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D: A says the astronaut will die before reaching. Since 81 is less than 150, he would survive. So the correct answer is C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me recalculate gamma with v=0.99999987c.

v = 0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) = approx 5.099e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962. So close to 1964, which I had earlier.

So T' = 160,000 / 1962 ≈ approx 81.3 years.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute 160,000 / 1962.

Well, 1962 *80 = 156,960. 160,000 -156,960=3,040.

3,040 /1962 ≈ 1.55 years. So total T'≈81.55 years, which rounds to about 81.5 years. So option C is 81 years, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance isn't 160k ly. Let me double-check. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So yes, D is 160,000 ly.

Wait, but wait another angle: perhaps the question is considering the time from the astronaut's perspective, which would be the proper time. So the proper time τ is given by τ = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = T / gamma.

But T is the time in Earth's frame: T = D/(v) = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 years.

So τ= 160,000 / gamma ≈ 160,000 /1962 ≈ 81.3 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So option C.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. 22 +81=103 years old. Their average lifetime is 150, so they would live long enough. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C) 81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience traveling to Earth, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity, particularly time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years (as measured in Earth's frame).

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026
\]

\[
\sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1962
\]

### Step 2: Time in Earth's frame (\( T \))
From Earth's perspective, the time taken for the spacecraft to travel to Earth is:

\[
T = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Proper time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \))
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is related to the time in Earth's frame by the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1962} \approx 81.3 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they will survive the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) 81 years**

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to note that 0.99999987 is so close to 1 that maybe I can approximate the gamma factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for v close to c. The expression under the square root, 1 - v²/c², becomes very small.

Let me compute 1 - v²/c². v is 0.99999987*c, so (v/c) is 0.99999987. So (v/c)^2 is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that: 0.99999987 squared. Well, 1 - 0.00000013 is 0.99999987. So (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. Thus, 1 - (v^2/c^2) ≈ 2.6e-7.

So the denominator under the square root is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's calculate sqrt(2.6e-7). 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 10^-7. The square root of 10^-7 is 10^-3.5 (because sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.16e-4). So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.09e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964.

So the time experienced by the astronaut would be the contracted distance divided by the speed. So t = D' / v. Because in their frame, Earth is approaching them at speed v, and the distance is D' = D/gamma.

So t = (D / gamma) / v.

But D in Earth’s frame is the distance to Earth, but wait, the spacecraft is in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The average distance between the LMC and Earth is about 160,000 light-years. So D is approximately 160,000 ly.

Wait, but the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time in Earth's frame first and then apply time dilation.

Wait, from Earth's perspective, the time taken is T = D / v, because the spaceship is approaching at speed v. So T = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so dividing ly by c (ly is light-year, so ly/c is time in years). So T = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 ≈ 160,000 years. But wait, that's a huge number, but from Earth's perspective, the spaceship is taking 160,000 years to reach. But from the spaceship's perspective, the time would be less due to time dilation.

Wait, no, because the spaceship's time is their proper time, so the astronaut's experienced time would be T' = T / gamma, where T is the Earth time. Because in Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock is running slower. So T' = T / gamma.

Wait, wait. From Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock runs at a rate of 1/gamma per Earth year. So for each Earth year, the spaceship's clock advances 1/gamma years. So the time experienced by the astronaut is T' = T / gamma.

So putting it together, T = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 years (since 0.99999987 is almost 1).

So T ≈ 160,000 years.

Then, T' = T / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ let me compute that: 160,000 / 2000 is 80. But 1964 is a bit less than 2000, so 160,000 /1964 ≈ approx 81.25 years.

Wait, because 1964 * 80 = 157,120. 1964 * 81= 1964*80=157120 +1964= 159,084. 1964*81.25= 159,084 + 1964*(0.25)= 491. So 159,575. Still lower than 160,000. Let's compute 81.25 * 1964.

Wait, 81 * 1964 = let's compute 80 *1964=157,120, plus 1*1964=157,120+1964=159,084.

159,084 is 160,000 - 916. So 81 years would give T' = 81 years, with 160,000 - 81 *1964 = 160,000 - 159,084 = 916 years left. But 916 /1964 is about 0.466 years, which is about 5.6 months. So 81 + 0.466 is approximately 81.466 years.

But the astronaut is 22 years old. So 81 years later, he would be 22 +81=103 years old. Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years. So 103 is less than 150, so he would live long enough.

But wait, the options given are 72, 77, 81. So according to this, approximately 81 years.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the distance is not 160,000 ly but something else. Wait, the problem states that the spacecraft is going to Earth, but perhaps the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 ly. So that would be D.

So back to the calculation: T = D / v ≈ 160,000 years. T' = T / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 1964 ≈ 81.25 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So the answer would be option C) 81 years.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D: A says the astronaut will die before reaching. Since 81 is less than 150, he would survive. So the correct answer is C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me recalculate gamma with v=0.99999987c.

v = 0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) = approx 5.099e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962. So close to 1964, which I had earlier.

So T' = 160,000 / 1962 ≈ approx 81.3 years.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute 160,000 / 1962.

Well, 1962 *80 = 156,960. 160,000 -156,960=3,040.

3,040 /1962 ≈ 1.55 years. So total T'≈81.55 years, which rounds to about 81.5 years. So option C is 81 years, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance isn't 160k ly. Let me double-check. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So yes, D is 160,000 ly.

But T is the time in Earth's frame: T = D/(v) = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 years.

So τ= 160,000 / gamma ≈ 160,000 /1962 ≈ 81.3 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. So option C.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. 22 +81=103 years old. Their average lifetime is 150, so they would live long enough. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C) 81 years.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[

\]

Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026
\]

\[
\sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}

The proper time experienced by the astronaut is related to the time in Earth's frame by the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1962} \approx 81.3 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they will survive the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) 81 years**

Answer: C
