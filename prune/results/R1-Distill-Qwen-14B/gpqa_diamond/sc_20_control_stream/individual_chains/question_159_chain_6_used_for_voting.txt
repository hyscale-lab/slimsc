Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that quasars are very luminous and they emit light across the spectrum. But why is there a peak at that specific wavelength?

Wait, when I think about redshift, wavelengths are stretched. So if the quasar is moving away, the light we see is redshifted. The peak observed at 790 nm would correspond to a particular emission line. Oh right, often quasars show emission lines like Lyman-alpha, which is in the UV. But if we see it in the near-infrared, that would mean it's been redshifted a lot.

The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, the redshift z would be (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5, so z ≈ 5.5. Wait, wait, let me get that more accurately. 121.6 * 6 is 729.6, which is less than 790. 121.6 * 6.5 is 790.4. Oh, so z is 6.5 - 1? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the formula for redshift is observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). So z = (observed / rest) - 1.

So 790 / 121.6 is about 6.499. So z ≈ 5.499, which is roughly z≈5.5.

But wait, that's a very high redshift. I mean, quasars can be at high z, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's another emission line. Oh, wait, another possibility is the Balmer series. For example, H-alpha is around 656 nm in rest. If observed is 790, then (790/656) -1 is about 19% increase, so z≈0.198. But that would be nearby, which doesn't make sense if the flux drops below 790. Wait, but the question says that at shorter wavelengths (so bluer than 790) the flux drops. So if the peak is in the near-infrared, that suggests a strong emission line there, which might be from a higher redshift.

Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break. The Lyman series in hydrogen has a break at 91.2 nm. Galaxies emitting beyond that (rest frame) would have their UV emission redshifted into the observed frame. So if the observed peak is at 790, which is longer than the rest UV, that suggests that the Lyman break is at 790. So the rest frame would have the break at 91.2, so (1 + z) = 790 / 91.2 ≈ 8.66. So z ≈7.66, which is really high. But wait, the peak at 790 nm—maybe that's the Lyman-alpha emission, which is in the UV rest. So if the peak is at 790, that's the redshifted Lyman-alpha.

Wait, another angle: the peak in the spectrum could be from the host galaxy's emission, but quasars have strong emission lines. So let's stick with the Lyman-alpha idea. So z is about 5.5.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to measure the distance to an object in a universe that is expanding. The comoving distance D_C is given by integrating from a=0 to a=1 (since we take a=1 as current time) the scale factor over the Hubble parameter.

The formula for comoving distance in a flat universe (which the question states) is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'),

where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda).

Here, Ω_m is 0.3, Ω_lambda is 0.7, and H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So I need to compute this integral from z=0 to z=5.5. But wait, is that the right z? Earlier I thought z was about 5.5 if the Lyman-alpha is at 790 nm. Alternatively, if the peak is from the Lyman break, then z would be higher, around 7.66, but that's a very high redshift. I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from the host galaxy's emission. Quasars have a big blue bump from the accretion disk, but that's in the UV. If the peak is in the near infrared, that could mean that the UV light is redshifted into IR. But the flux drops at shorter wavelengths—so in the observed spectrum, the flux is highest at 790 nm and less blueward. That might indicate a drop-off due to the Lyman limit. Or perhaps the emission line at that wavelength is prominent.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the [OIII] emission line, but I'm not sure about the rest wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from the Balmer break. For a galaxy, the Balmer break is where the Balmer series (like H-alpha, H-beta) in the rest frame is at optical wavelengths. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, that would imply a redshift where the rest frame optical is shifted into near-infrared.

H-alpha is at 656 nm rest. So if observed at 790, that's z=(790/656) -1 ≈ 0.199. Which is a small z, about 0.2. But that doesn't align with the flux drop below 790. Because at z=0.2, the rest UV would be at 0.4*(1+z) times the observed wavelength. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is due to the Lyman-alpha emission line. If Lyman-alpha is at 121.6 nm rest, observed at 790 nm, that gives z ≈ (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.5 - 1=5.5. So z≈5.5.

So if the redshift is about 5.5, then the comoving distance would be needed.

But wait, wait. The comoving distance for a given z can be approximated using some lookup tables or approximate integrals. Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe and the expansion.

Alternatively, using an online calculator or approximation. Oh, but I can't do that now, so I'll have to remember some approximate values.

Wait, I remember that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at z=2 is about 3 Gpc, z=5 around 8 Gpc, z=10 around 16 Gpc, etc. So if z is about 5.5, D_C should be around 8 Gpc.

Wait, let me think about the integral.

The integral is ∫0^z dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

So, to compute this, for each z' from 0 to 5.5, compute E(z'), take the reciprocal, and sum up.

Alternatively, I can approximate this integral.

But perhaps instead of computing it exactly, I can use an approximate formula or know that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc.

Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

So if z is around 5.5, then 8 Gpc is the likely answer (option B).

But wait, another way to compute it is using the approximation for the comoving distance in a matter-dominated and dark energy dominated universe.

The integral can be split into parts where the universe was matter-dominated and where dark energy starts to dominate.

But maybe it's easier to remember that at high z, the expansion history is dominated by matter, but at low z, dark energy.

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda(1+z')^(3(1+w)) )

Wait, but dark energy is often modeled as a cosmological constant, which has w=-1, so (1+z')^(3(1+(-1))) = (1+z')^0 =1, so the dark energy term scales as (1+z')^0.

Wait, so E(z) = sqrt( Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda )

So, the integral becomes ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7) 

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator would help, but since I can't do that now, I have to rely on approximation.

I remember that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, it's about 8.7 Gpc. Wait, let me think about the Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, which is 70/(3.086e19) m/s/m.

But to compute the integral accurately, perhaps I can use the approximation:

For z <<1, E(z)≈1, so the integral is z, but for higher z, it's dominated by matter.

Wait, but for z=5.5, matter is still dominant.

Wait, I think that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, the comoving distance at high z is approximately given by:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * (2/(3Ω_m^(1/2))) ) * ( (1+z)^1.5 - 1 )

But I'm not sure if that's the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for a matter-dominated universe (Ω_m=1), the comoving distance is (2c/H0) * (1/(sqrt(Ω_m)) )) * ( (1+z)^(1/2) -1 ) ), but since here Ω_m is 0.3, maybe it's a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for z much larger than 1, the comoving distance is roughly (c/H0) * (1+z) / sqrt(Ω_m) * (some factor).

Wait, let me think in terms of the Friedmann equation.

The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = \int_0^z \frac{c dz'}{a(z') H(z')}

Since a(z) = 1/(1+z), so da = - a^2 dz / (1+z)^2 dz.

But perhaps it's easier to parametrize by the scale factor a.

Wait, in terms of a, the integral is:

D_C = \int_{a=0}^{a=1} (c / H0) * (da / E(a))

Where E(a) = sqrt(Ω_m/a^{-3} + Ω_lambda a^0 )

So E(a) = sqrt(0.3/(a^3) + 0.7 )

But integrating from a=0 to a=1/(1+z). Hmm.

This is getting complicated, but I think the integral for z=5.5 is roughly 8 Gpc.

So the options are:

A)6 Gpc

B)8 Gpc

C)9 Gpc

D)7 Gpc

So the answer would be B) 8 Gpc.

To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth, we analyze the given data and apply cosmological principles. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This suggests the peak corresponds to a prominent emission line, likely redshifted from the rest frame. Assuming the peak is due to the Lyman-alpha line, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm, the redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.5
\]

This high redshift indicates the quasar is located at a significant distance from the Earth. The comoving distance \( D_C \) in a flat universe is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}
\]

where \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \). For \( z \approx 5.5 \), the integral is dominated by the matter term at high redshifts, and the comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc based on standard cosmological approximations.

Given the options:

- **A) 6 Gpc**: Too low for \( z \approx 5.5 \).
- **B) 8 Gpc**: Matches the expected comoving distance for \( z \approx 5.5 \) in the given cosmological parameters.
- **C) 9 Gpc**: Slightly too high for \( z \approx 5.5 \).
- **D) 7 Gpc**: Close but slightly lower than the expected value.

The most consistent answer is **B) 8 Gpc**.

Answer: B
