Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and their elements should be complex numbers. Oh, but here the elements are real numbers. Maybe that's okay for this problem. 

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. I need to find the probability that measuring this observable P will give 0.

Wait, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which makes sense for measurements. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements of P: the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both 1/sqrt(2), which is real, so their complex conjugates are the same. Similarly, (1,3) is 0 and (3,1) is 0. The diagonal elements are 0, so the matrix is symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I think I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, particularly the one with eigenvalue 0. Then, the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the given state.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of an observable is given by the state vector multiplied by the matrix and then the conjugate transpose. But here, the question is about the probability of getting a specific outcome, which is 0. So I should find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product of the state with those eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P has some structure that can be exploited without going through the full diagonalization. Let me write down the matrix P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Wait, that looks a bit like a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/sqrt(2) in some positions. Let me think about the eigenvalues. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, I can try to find its eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0. Let's compute that.

The matrix is:

| -λ    1/sqrt(2)    0     |
|1/sqrt(2)   -λ     1/sqrt(2)|
| 0     1/sqrt(2)   -λ    |

Calculating the determinant: 

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, that might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if there's a smarter way. Let me see the matrix again.

Hmm, looking at the matrix, maybe I can see eigenvectors. Let's consider the vector (1, 1, 1). Let's see what P does when multiplied by this vector.

P * (1, 1, 1) = [
(0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1) = (1/sqrt(2)),
( (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 ) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2),
(0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 ) = 1/sqrt(2)
]

So the resulting vector is (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). Hmm, that's not a scalar multiple of the original vector (1,1,1), so that's not an eigenvector. 

What about the vector (1, -1, 1)? Let's compute P times this.

P*(1,-1,1) = [
(0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*1) = -1/sqrt(2),
( (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 ) = (1 +1)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2),
(0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) +0*1) = -1/sqrt(2)
]

So the result is (-1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). Again, not sure if that's an eigenvector.

Wait, maybe looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0 would be easier. So, (P - 0 I) v = 0. So P v = 0.

We can write the equations:

Row 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0. Then from row 2, v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for lambda=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors can be written as (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1). So any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). 

Now, the state of the system is the vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? Because probabilities must sum to 1. Let me check the norm of (-1,2,1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state should be a unit vector, but in this problem, maybe it's given as a non-normalized state. Hmm, but for the purpose of calculating probabilities, do I need to normalize it?

Wait, the state vector in quantum mechanics is a unit vector, so perhaps the given vector is not normalized. The problem says it's a column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). So probably, it's not a unit vector. So when calculating probabilities, we might need to normalize it first. Or perhaps the question assumes it's already normalized? Wait, the sum is 6. So sqrt(6) is the norm. So the actual state would be (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). But the problem gives the state as (-1,2,1), perhaps expecting to use it as is, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the question, the state is given as a column matrix, and the observable is given by P. So to find the probability of measuring 0, I think the state should be a unit vector. So perhaps I should first normalize it.

So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). So let me note that down.

Now, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1,0,-1). So the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and this eigenvector.

Wait, let me think. The probability is |<v|e> |^2, where e is the eigenvector. But since the eigenvector is not normalized, perhaps I should first normalize it. Let's compute the norm of (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2= 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product between the state vector (after normalization) and the eigenvector is:

v = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1 )

e = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )

The inner product is v† e = ( (-1/sqrt(6)) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) *0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

So that's (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(12) = 2√3. So 2/(2√3) ) = 1/√3. Wait, but wait:

Wait, the terms are each (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) and (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)).

So adding them: [ (-1) + (-1) ] / sqrt(12) ) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The state of the system is given as the column vector \( v = (-1, 2, 1) \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The goal is to find the probability of measuring \( P \) to yield 0.

### Step 2: Finding the Eigenvector for Eigenvalue 0
To find the eigenvectors of \( P \) corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, we solve \( P v = 0 \). This gives the following system of equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow v_2 = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow v_1 + v_3 = 0 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow v_2 = 0 \).

From these equations, \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_3 = -v_1 \). Thus, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form \( (v_1, 0, -v_1) \), which can be written as \( v_1 (1, 0, -1) \). The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
e = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalizing the State Vector
The given state vector is \( v = (-1, 2, 1) \). Its norm is:

\[
\|v\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
\tilde{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the Probability
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the normalized state \( \tilde{v} \) and the normalized eigenvector \( e \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle \tilde{v} | e \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \tilde{v} | e \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right)
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( -1 - 1 \right)
= \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle \tilde{v} | e \rangle = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
