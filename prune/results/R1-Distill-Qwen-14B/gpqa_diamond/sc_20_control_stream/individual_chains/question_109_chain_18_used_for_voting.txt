Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each involving different angular momentum states for the emitted particle.

First, I think I need to understand the initial and final states. The initial state is 1S0, which is given as (2S+1)L(J). Wait, no, wait—the term is written as (2S+1)L^J. So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. Because 1S0 is a singlet state with no orbital angular momentum, so L=0, S=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X, so the two-nucleon (NN) system goes from the initial state to a final state. The problem says the final state's isospin is T(NN)=0.

Pauli statistics imply that the overall wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on the type of particles. But wait, the two nucleons are identical fermions, so their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But the emission of a particle X complicates things a bit. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement gives a condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L +1 mod 2. For the final state, T is 0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Therefore, S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd. That means either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa. Wait, no. Because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → S + L = -1 mod 2 → which is same as 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

So the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the final NN state must be odd.

Now, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. After emission, the NN state has some L and S. Let's think about angular momentum and parity conservation.

When the particle X is emitted, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. So the initial state's angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final state will have the NN state with angular momentum J_final, and the emitted particle X with angular momentum l (denoted by lowercase letters in the options: like S, P, D, F). So the total angular momentum after emission must be J_initial plus the orbital angular momentum of X. Wait, but how does that work?

Wait, the initial state's angular momentum is J=0. After emission, the NN system has some angular momentum (L_final, S_final, J_final), and the emitted particle X has its own angular momentum. So the total angular momentum should be the sum of the NN's J_final and X's orbital angular momentum L_X, but wait, because the emission is via a transition that involves angular momentum.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The initial NN state is in a state with orbital angular momentum L_initial =0, spin S_initial=0, so J_initial=0. When they emit a particle X, which has orbital angular momentum l (denoted as the letters S, P, D, F, etc.), the system's angular momentum must be conserved. So the sum of the NN's angular momentum after emission and the X's angular momentum should equal the initial angular momentum (which is 0). But wait, that can't be right because the initial state is zero, but emission usually involves some angular momentum. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the transition.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the NN system transitions from J_initial=0 to J_final, and the emitted particle X has angular momentum l. So the conservation of angular momentum would require that J_final = l. Or maybe the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial state's angular momentum, which is 0. So the NN's J_final plus X's l must sum to 0. That would imply that J_final = -l, but since angular momentum is quantized, this can only happen if l=0 and J_final=0, but that's not possible for certain transitions. Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (the l in the options) must match the change in the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. So the initial state has L=0, and the final state has L_final. The change in angular momentum is L_final - 0 = L_final, which must be equal to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So L_final = l?

Wait, that makes sense. Because when a particle is emitted, it carries away angular momentum. So the NN system's orbital angular momentum L changes by L = l. So L_final = L_initial + l. But L_initial is 0, so L_final = l. So the final NN state's orbital angular momentum L (NN) is equal to the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l.

So the emitted particle's l is the same as the final L of the NN system.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The orbital angular momentum of the system (NN) plus the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) should equal the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero. So L_initial = 0. So 0 = L_final + l → L_final = -l. Since angular momentum is quantized in integer values, L_final must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But in terms of quantum numbers, L is a non-negative integer, so the only possibility is L_final = l and the emitted particle has l, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the total orbital angular momentum is conserved. So the initial orbital angular momentum is 0, so the sum of the final orbital angular momentum of the NN system plus that of the emitted particle must be zero. So L_final + l =0. But L_final and l are both non-negative integers, so the only possibility is L_final=0 and l=0. That can't be right because the options have various l values.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach could be to look at the parity. The initial state has parity P_initial. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. The initial state is 1S0, so L=0 → P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Then the parity conservation would require that the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of X equals the initial parity. So P_final * P_X = P_initial.

So P_final = P_initial / P_X.

But P_X is -1, so P_final = (+1) / (-1) = -1. So the final NN state must have parity -1.

The parity of the final state is (-1)^{L_final} = -1. So (-1)^{L_final} = -1 → L_final is odd. Because any even L would give +1 parity, so to get -1, L_final must be odd.

From the earlier condition, the final NN state has T=0. The condition was T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S and L must sum to an odd number.

But we already know that L is odd (from the parity condition). So L is odd. Therefore, S must be even because S + odd = odd → S must be even.

So S is even. So the spin of the final NN state must be even.

Now, considering the angular momentum part. The initial state's J is 0. After emission, the NN state has J_final, and the emitted particle has angular momentum l. So the initial J is 0, and the total angular momentum after emission must have J_final + l = 0? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The total angular momentum must be conserved, but J_initial is the angular momentum of the NN system before emission. When they emit a particle X with orbital angular momentum l, the NN system's J after emission will be J_final, and X's orbital angular momentum is l. So the initial J (0) must equal the vector sum of J_final and l. Hmm, but vectorially adding them is tricky because they can have different directions. But maybe considering their magnitudes, the only possibility is that J_final = l, but that's not necessarily the case because J_final can be any value that can be obtained by adding l to some component.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity condition is more straightforward. So, the parity of the final state is -1, so L_final is odd. So for the options, I need to look at the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l and see if it leads to the correct L_final.

Wait, going back to the earlier point: when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum l of X must match the change in the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. So the initial L is 0, and the final L is L_final. So the change is L_final - 0 = L_final. This must be equal to l? Because the emitted particle carries away l units of angular momentum. So L_final = l.

Wait, that makes sense because when the system emits a particle, the orbital angular momentum change would be the same as the emitted particle's l. So yes, L_final = l.

So the emitted particle's l is the same as the final L of the NN system.

Now, from the parity condition, we have L_final is odd. So l must be odd. Because L_final = l, and L_final is odd. So the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum must be an odd integer (like 1, 3, etc.).

Looking at the options:

A) 7D1 + p → D is l=2. So l=2 is even. Wait, D is l=2, which is even. Since l must be odd, this would make L_final = 2, which is even—so this would violate the parity condition. Because parity would be (-1)^2=1, but we need parity -1. So option A's l is even, which would make L_final even. So this is not allowed.

Wait, wait, let me check all options.

Options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p → X is p (a particle with l=1?), but here it's written as 'p', which is a momentum state. Hmm, no, wait, the option says 7D1 + p. So the emitted particle is a proton? Or perhaps 'p' refers to the orbital state. Wait, the term is probably written as (2S+1)L^J. So 7D1 would be (2S+1)=7, so S=3. L=2 (D), J=1.

Wait no, the problem says the emitted particle is X, and the options describe the final state as something like 3S1 + p. So perhaps the part after the arrow is the emitted particle's state. Wait, looking again: the options are written as 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the part after the arrow is the final NN state (7D1) and the emitted particle (p). So the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is determined by the letter before the number. So in option A, the emitted particle is p, which I think refers to a particle with orbital angular momentum l=1 (like a P state). So l=1. But the emitted particle's l is 1, so L_final would be l=1, which is odd. So parity is (-1)^1 = -1 → which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the emitted particle's l would have to be odd. So option A's emitted particle has l=1 (P state), which is odd. So L_final is 1, which is correct for parity. So option A's scenario would have parity correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the emitted particle is a D (l=2), which is even, that would be a problem. But in option A, the emitted particle is 'p', not 'D'. So in that case, the emitted particle's l is 1, so L_final=1.

So the parity would be (-1)^1 = -1, which is correct.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the emitted particle's l must be odd because L_final is odd. So in that case, all options where the emitted particle has even l (like D=2) would be invalid. Let's see:

Option A: emitted particle is p → l=1 (odd) → allowed.

Option B: emitted particle is 3S1 + p. Wait, the part after the arrow is the final NN state (3S1) and the emitted particle (p). So the emitted particle's l is 1. So again, allowed.

Option C: 3D3 + f. So the emitted particle is 'f', which is F state → l=3 (odd). So allowed.

Option D: 3P0 + s. The emitted particle is 's' → l=0 (even). Because s is S state, l=0. So the emitted particle's l is 0, which is even. So L_final = l =0, which is even. That would make the parity (-1)^0=+1, which doesn't match the required parity of -1. So option D's scenario would have parity +1, which is wrong. So this option is not allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The emitted particle's l is the same as L_final. So if the emitted particle is 's' (l=0), then L_final=0. Then the parity would be (+1), which is incorrect. So option D is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the emitted particle's l must be odd, so any option with emitted particle l even would be invalid. So looking for that.

But wait, let's make a table.

Option | Emitted Particle | l (orbital)
A | p (P state) | l=1 (odd)
B | p (P state) | l=1 (odd)
C | f (F state) | l=3 (odd)
D | s (S state) | l=0 (even)

So for parity, the final state's L must be odd, so l must be odd. So options A, B, C have emitted particles with l odd, which is fine, D has l=0 (even), which is not allowed. So D is not permitted.

But wait, the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. So D would be the one not permitted because its l is even, leading to L_final even and parity +1, which violates the condition.

But wait, let me double-check.

The initial parity is +1. The emitted particle has parity -1. So the final NN state's parity must be P_NN = P_initial / P_X = (+1) / (-1) = -1. So the final state's parity is -1 → which implies L_final is odd.

The emitted particle's l is the same as L_final, so l must be odd. So any option where the emitted particle has even l (like S, D) would be invalid.

Wait, option D's emitted particle is 's' (S state, l=0, even). So that's invalid.

So the answer would be D.

But wait, let me check each option again.

Option A: emitted is p → l=1 → L_final=1 (odd) → parity -1. Correct.

Option B: emitted is p → l=1 → same as A.

Option C: emitted is f → l=3 → correct.

Option D: emitted is s → l=0 → L_final=0 → parity +1. Not allowed.

Thus, option D is the one that's not permitted.

To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions and conservation laws.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial State**: The two-nucleon (NN) system is in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of this state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Emission of Particle X**: The NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( P_X = -1 \). Conservation of parity requires:
   \[
   P_{\text{final, NN}} \cdot P_X = P_{\text{initial}}
   \]
   Substituting \( P_X = -1 \) and \( P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \), we find:
   \[
   P_{\text{final, NN}} = \frac{P_{\text{initial}}}{P_X} = \frac{+1}{-1} = -1
   \]
   The parity of the final NN state is \( P_{\text{final, NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \). Setting this equal to \( -1 \), we conclude:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} = -1 \implies L_{\text{final}} \text{ is odd}.
   \]

3. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: The problem states that for the final NN state:
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]
   Given \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]
   Since \( L_{\text{final}} \) is odd (from the parity condition), \( S_{\text{NN}} \) must be even to satisfy the above equation.

4. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \( X \) (denoted by \( l \)) must match the change in the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. Since the initial orbital angular momentum of the NN system is \( L_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), we have:
   \[
   L_{\text{final}} = l.
   \]
   Thus, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \( X \) must be the same as \( L_{\text{final}} \), which is odd.

### Analysis of Options:
Each option specifies the emitted particle and its orbital angular momentum \( l \). The parity condition requires \( L_{\text{final}} = l \) to be odd. Therefore, any option where the emitted particle has an even \( l \) is not permitted.

- **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \). The emitted particle \( p \) corresponds to \( l = 1 \) (P state), which is odd. This is allowed.
- **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \). The emitted particle \( p \) corresponds to \( l = 1 \) (P state), which is odd. This is allowed.
- **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \). The emitted particle \( f \) corresponds to \( l = 3 \) (F state), which is odd. This is allowed.
- **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \). The emitted particle \( s \) corresponds to \( l = 0 \) (S state), which is even. This violates the parity condition and is not allowed.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave in **Option D** is not permitted because the emitted particle \( s \) has \( l = 0 \), which is even and does not satisfy the parity conservation requirement.
