Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me see... The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Hmm, point P is located a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, so outside the big sphere. But inside the conductor, since it's uncharged, the charges should redistribute in a certain way. Oh right, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite, and the outer surface will have none because the conductor was initially uncharged and isolated. Or wait, no, if the conductor is uncharged, the total charge is zero. So the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface remains neutral. 

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges will move freely. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q. And because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance, but wait no, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge is zero. If the cavity has +q, the conductor's inner surface must have -q. That leaves the outer surface as +q? No, because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, no: the initial conductor is uncharged. When we put a charge of +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q (to cancel the field inside the conductor material), and the outer surface must have +q because the conductor was originally neutral. Wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged, then the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So the inner surface is -q, the outer surface must be +q, because the outer surface's charge plus the inner's should sum to zero. Wait, that can't be right because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner and outer together sum to zero. So if the inner is -q, the outer would be +q? No, that would make the total charge +q, which is not zero. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The conductor is neutral (uncharged). When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges rearrange so that the field inside the conducting material is zero. So inside the conductor, the induced charge is -q on the inner surface. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor's total is zero. Wait, no, wait. The conductor's total charge is zero. So inner surface is -q, so the outer surface must have +q so that the total is (-q) + (+q) = 0. No, wait, that would make the conductor have a net charge of zero, which is correct because it was uncharged. 

Wait, no. The conductor's initial charge is zero. When I put +q in the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero? No, that would cause the outer surface to have +q, leading the conductor's total charge to be zero. Because the conductor's charge is inner + outer: (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense. 

Wait, but wait another thing: the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at point P would be due to the outer surface's charge. Because inside the conductor, the field is zero. So the field outside would be as if all the charge is at the center, per the shell theorem. So the field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / L², where Q_enclosed is the charge enclosed, which is +q. Because the outer surface has +q, so that's the charge that contributes to the field outside. 

Wait, but the outer surface has +q? No, wait. The conductor was initially neutral. The cavity's charge is +q, which induces a charge of -q on the inner surface. So the conductor's total charge is zero. The outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner is -q, so the outer is +q to make the total zero. So the outer surface has +q. 

So the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So the field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. 

Wait, but looking at the options. Option B says that. So the electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So the answer is option B. 

But wait, I'm supposed to think about the point P's position relative to the cavity. Because the cavity is offset. The charge +q is inside the cavity, whose center is a distance s from the conductor's center. Would that affect the field at P? 

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution. The point P is outside, so regardless of the position of the charge within the cavity (as long as the conductor is a perfect conductor), the outer charge distribution is spherically symmetric. So the electric field outside only depends on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center to P, which is L. 

But wait, another point: the conductor's inner surface has a charge of -q, but that's inside the conductor material. That affects the field inside the conductor. But the outer surface's charge would be distributed spherically symmetrically because it's a conductor. So the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the field at P would be k*q/(L²), where k is 1/(4πε₀). 

So the correct answer should be option B. 

Wait, but let me think again. What if the cavity is not at the center? Because the center of the cavity is a distance s from the conductor's center. Would that change anything? Oh, but the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the inner surface would redistribute. The inner surface would have a charge distribution such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So, the inner surface would have a charge of -q, but distributed in a way that cancels the field from the +q charge inside. Because the charge inside is not at the center, the inner surface charge would be displaced. So the outer surface charge would still be uniformly distributed, assuming the conductor is a perfect sphere. Because any asymmetry in the inner charge would be canceled by the inner surface, leaving the outer surface symmetric. 

So, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform, leading to the same electric field outside as if it were a point charge at the center. 

So the electric field at point P is k q / L². So option B is correct. 

Wait, but one of the options is about l and theta. So why is that? Let me see the options again.

Option A: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(l - s cosθ)²

Option C: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(l + s cosθ)²

Option D: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(l²)

Option B: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(L²)

So if point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, and L is the distance, then option B seems correct because the field outside a uniformly charged sphere is the same as a point charge at the center. 

But why are there options involving l and theta? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the setup again. The point P is outside the conductor, so L> R. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the distance between the conductor's center and the cavity's center is s. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so any point P outside is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The field at P due to the outer charge is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², regardless of where the cavity is located within the conductor. Because the conductor's outer surface maintains a spherically symmetric distribution. 

So the correct answer should be option B. 

But wait, what if the conductor is not a perfect conductor? Or if it's a thin shell? No, the problem says it's a conductor, so charges on the outer surface would distribute uniformly. 

Therefore, the electric field at point P is due to the charge +q on the outer surface, and it's given by option B.

To determine the electric field **$\vec{E}$** at a point **$P$** outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The conductor is initially uncharged (total charge = 0). When a charge **$+q$** is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of **$-q$** to cancel the electric field within the conducting material. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of **$+q$** to balance the total charge.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the center. The outer surface of the conductor has a spherically symmetric charge distribution of **$+q$**, so the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge **$+q$** located at the center of the conductor. This follows from the shell theorem, which states that a uniformly charged spherical shell behaves as if all its charge is concentrated at its center.

3. **Relevance of Cavity Position**:  
   The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance **$s$**, and the point **$P$** is at a distance **$L$** from the conductor's center. However, the outer surface charge distribution remains spherically symmetric because the conductor is a perfect conductor. Thus, the electric field at **$P$** depends only on **$q$** and **$L$**, not on the position of the cavity or the angle **$\theta$**.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves **$l - s \cos\theta$**, which is irrelevant because the field outside depends only on **$L$**, not on the cavity's position.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field at **$P$** is given by **$E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$**, consistent with the field produced by a point charge **$+q$** at the center.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Similar to Option A, this involves **$l + s \cos\theta$**, which is not relevant for the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While it involves **$l^2$**, the distance **$l$** is not the relevant distance for the field outside the conductor; **$L$** is the correct distance.

Thus, the electric field at **$P$** is determined solely by the charge **$+q$** on the outer surface and the distance **$L$** from the center of the conductor. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
