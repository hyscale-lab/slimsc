Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about. It's about particle physics, specifically involving pions and muons. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta—meaning their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. That's because momentum is a vector quantity, so their sum must be zero.

Wait, but wait a minute. The pion is a boson with spin 0, and the muon is a fermion with spin 1/2. The neutrino is also a lepton with spin 1/2. So the decay must conserve angular momentum as well. Oh right, but that might complicate things. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, I can ignore angular momentum considerations as the question is about energy and kinetic energy.

So, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is m_pi c squared. But since we're working in units where c=1 (because we're using MeV and such), it's just 139.6 MeV.

The products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is massless or has a negligible mass, I think. Wait, in reality, neutrinos have tiny masses, but in many problems, they're considered massless for simplicity. But let me check the problem statement. The question doesn't mention the neutrino's mass, so perhaps in this context, it's treated as zero. That would make sense because the neutrino is very light.

So, the muon and neutrino are the products. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible (or zero), its momentum would be E_nu = |p_nu| c, but since c is 1, E_nu = |p_nu|.

Wait, but the muon has mass, so its energy and momentum are related by E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Again, assuming c=1, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), but with opposite directions, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this common magnitude as p. So the neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

But the initial energy is just m_pi, so:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Substituting the numbers, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

Let me set up the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

This looks a bit tricky. I'll let x = p. So,

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I can rearrange this to sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Then, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So subtract x² from both sides, it cancels out.

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 x.

Compute the squares:

105.7^2 = approx 11170.49 (since 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140, so 10000 +1140 +32.49 = 11172.49. Hmm, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 105.7 * 105.7 = let's compute it:

105.7 *105.7: 100*100=10,000, 100 *5.7=570, 5.7 *100=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49. So (100+5.7)^2 =10000 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute that.

139 *139: 139^2 is (140-1)^2 =140² - 2*140*1 +1 =19600 -280 +1= 19321. Then, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and 2 *139 *0.6 =166.8. So 139.6² is (139 +0.6)^2 =139² + 2*139*0.6 +0.6² =19321 +166.8 +0.36= 19488.16 MeV².

So back to the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Let's compute 2*139.6: 279.2.

So the equation becomes:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging,

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute the subtraction: 19488.16 -11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x =8315.67.

Then x =8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 *279.2 is 8376.

But 8315.67 is a bit less than that. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33.

Wait, 8376 -60.33 =8315.67.

So, 30 - (60.33 /279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈29.784 MeV.

So p = x ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but earlier I set p as the magnitude of the momentum, so p is about 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

We can compute that:

29.784^2 ≈ 886.98.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So sum is 11172.49 +886.98=12059.47.

Square root of that is sqrt(12059.47) ≈ 109.83 MeV. Wait, but that can't be right because the pion's mass is 139.6, and the muon's energy must be less than that. Oh wait, no, because the muon is a product along with the neutrino. Wait, wait, no, the muon's energy is more than its rest mass because it has kinetic energy. Oh right, the muon's total energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(12059.47) again. Wait 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 =109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8² =11881 + 174.4 + 0.64= 12056.04. Hmm, our value is 12059.47, which is a bit higher.

So 109.8^2=12056.04, 109.85^2= ?

Compute (109.8 +0.05)^2=109.8^2 + 2*109.8*0.05 +0.05^2 =12056.04 +10.98 +0.0025=12067.0225. Wait, that's more than 12059.47. So perhaps 109.83^2 = approx 12059.47.

But perhaps I should just accept it as 109.8 MeV.

So the muon's energy is approx 109.8 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is p =29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Because the initial energy was 139.6 MeV. So 109.8 +29.784 =139.584, which is about 139.6; that makes sense.

So the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is all kinetic since its rest mass is zero (approximated here). So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.1 and 29.8. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, that's very close. So KE_mu is 4.12, KE_nu is 29.8.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the equation step by step.

We have:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p =139.6.

Let me define variables more precisely.

Let me denote m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Then, equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So,

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Squaring both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Cancel p^2 on both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearrange:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu^2.

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi).

Ah, okay, that's a more straightforward way.

So substitute the numbers:

m_pi² = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu² = (105.7)^2 =11172.49 MeV².

So m_pi² - m_mu^2 =19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67 MeV².

Then, 2 m_pi =2 *139.6=279.2 MeV.

So p=8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute that division.

8315.67 ÷279.2:

Well, 279.2 *29= 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2=8376-279.2=8096.8. Which is less than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.784 = ?

Wait, 279.2 *30=8376. So 29.784 is 30 -0.216.

So 279.2 *29.784 =279.2*(30 -0.216)=8376 - (279.2 *0.216).

279.2 *0.2=55.84.

279.2 *0.016= ~4.4672.

So 55.84 +4.4672=60.3072.

So 279.2 *29.784 ≈8376 -60.3072=8315.6928.

Which is very close to 8315.67, so 29.784 is the correct p.

So p =29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is 29.784 MeV. Since it's a massless particle, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy, so K_nu=29.784 MeV.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 +105.7^2 )

(29.784)^2 = approx 886.98.

105.7^2=11172.49.

Sum is 11172.49 + 886.98 =12059.47.

Square root of that is approximately sqrt(12059.47)≈109.8 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

So KE_mu=4.1 MeV and KE_nu=29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Did I make a mistake in any step?

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute the p with more precise numbers.

p= (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) = (19488.16 -11172.49)/279.2 =8315.67/279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29.784.

Wait, 279.2 *29.784 =?

279.2 *29=8096.8.

279.2 *0.784.

Let me compute 279.2 *0.7 =195.44.

279.2 *0.08=22.336.

279.2 *0.004=1.1168.

So 0.7+0.08+0.004=0.784.

So sum:195.44 +22.336=217.776 +1.1168=218.8928.

So 29 *279.2=8096.8.

0.784 *279.2=218.8928.

So 29.784 *279.2=8096.8 +218.8928=8315.6928 MeV².

Which matches the numerator 8315.67 MeV², so p=29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's KE is 29.784, which is approx 29.8 MeV.

Muon's KE is 4.1 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 as in option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon, \( \mu^+ \), and a neutrino, \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino is assumed to be massless (\( m_\nu = 0 \)).

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 \). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino: \( E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+} c^2 \).
2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum: \( p_{\mu^+} = -p_\nu \).

### Energy and Momentum Relations
For the muon, its total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
For the neutrino, since it is massless, its total energy equals its momentum:
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu.
\]
Let the magnitude of the momentum of both particles be \( p \). Then:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}, \quad E_\nu = p.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \( p^2 \) and rearranging:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
Substitute \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Neutrino Energy**: Since \( E_\nu = p \), the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
2. **Muon Energy**: Using \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
\[
(29.784)^2 \approx 886.98, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.98 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.47} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**: The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**: Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy:
\[
K_\nu = E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Matching with Options
The calculated kinetic energies are approximately \( K_{\mu^+} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( K_\nu = 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), which match **Option D**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about. It's about particle physics, specifically involving pions and muons. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta—meaning their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. That's because momentum is a vector quantity, so their sum must be zero.

Wait, but wait a minute. The pion is a boson with spin 0, and the muon is a fermion with spin 1/2. The neutrino is also a lepton with spin 1/2. So the decay must conserve angular momentum as well. Oh right, but that might complicate things. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, I can ignore angular momentum considerations as the question is about energy and kinetic energy.

So, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is m_pi c squared. But since we're working in units where c=1 (because we're using MeV and such), it's just 139.6 MeV.

The products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is massless or has a negligible mass, I think. Wait, in reality, neutrinos have tiny masses, but in many problems, they're considered massless for simplicity. But let me check the problem statement. The question doesn't mention the neutrino's mass, so perhaps in this context, it's treated as zero. That would make sense because the neutrino is very light.

So, the muon and neutrino are the products. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible (or zero), its momentum would be E_nu = |p_nu| c, but since c is 1, E_nu = |p_nu|.

Wait, but the muon has mass, so its energy and momentum are related by E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Again, assuming c=1, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), but with opposite directions, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this common magnitude as p. So the neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

But the initial energy is just m_pi, so:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Substituting the numbers, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

Let me set up the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

This looks a bit tricky. I'll let x = p. So,

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I can rearrange this to sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Then, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So subtract x² from both sides, it cancels out.

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 x.

Compute the squares:

105.7^2 = approx 11170.49 (since 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140, so 10000 +1140 +32.49 = 11172.49. Hmm, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 105.7 * 105.7 = let's compute it:

105.7 *105.7: 100*100=10,000, 100 *5.7=570, 5.7 *100=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49. So (100+5.7)^2 =10000 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute that.

139 *139: 139^2 is (140-1)^2 =140² - 2*140*1 +1 =19600 -280 +1= 19321. Then, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and 2 *139 *0.6 =166.8. So 139.6² is (139 +0.6)^2 =139² + 2*139*0.6 +0.6² =19321 +166.8 +0.36= 19488.16 MeV².

So back to the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Let's compute 2*139.6: 279.2.

So the equation becomes:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging,

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute the subtraction: 19488.16 -11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x =8315.67.

Then x =8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 *279.2 is 8376.

But 8315.67 is a bit less than that. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33.

Wait, 8376 -60.33 =8315.67.

So, 30 - (60.33 /279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈29.784 MeV.

So p = x ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but earlier I set p as the magnitude of the momentum, so p is about 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

We can compute that:

29.784^2 ≈ 886.98.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So sum is 11172.49 +886.98=12059.47.

Square root of that is sqrt(12059.47) ≈ 109.83 MeV. Wait, but that can't be right because the pion's mass is 139.6, and the muon's energy must be less than that. Oh wait, no, because the muon is a product along with the neutrino. Wait, wait, no, the muon's energy is more than its rest mass because it has kinetic energy. Oh right, the muon's total energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(12059.47) again. Wait 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 =109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8² =11881 + 174.4 + 0.64= 12056.04. Hmm, our value is 12059.47, which is a bit higher.

So 109.8^2=12056.04, 109.85^2= ?

Compute (109.8 +0.05)^2=109.8^2 + 2*109.8*0.05 +0.05^2 =12056.04 +10.98 +0.0025=12067.0225. Wait, that's more than 12059.47. So perhaps 109.83^2 = approx 12059.47.

But perhaps I should just accept it as 109.8 MeV.

So the muon's energy is approx 109.8 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is p =29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Because the initial energy was 139.6 MeV. So 109.8 +29.784 =139.584, which is about 139.6; that makes sense.

So the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is all kinetic since its rest mass is zero (approximated here). So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.1 and 29.8. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, that's very close. So KE_mu is 4.12, KE_nu is 29.8.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the equation step by step.

We have:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p =139.6.

Let me define variables more precisely.

Let me denote m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Then, equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So,

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Squaring both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Cancel p^2 on both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearrange:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu^2.

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi).

Ah, okay, that's a more straightforward way.

So substitute the numbers:

m_pi² = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu² = (105.7)^2 =11172.49 MeV².

So m_pi² - m_mu^2 =19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67 MeV².

Then, 2 m_pi =2 *139.6=279.2 MeV.

So p=8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute that division.

8315.67 ÷279.2:

Well, 279.2 *29= 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2=8376-279.2=8096.8. Which is less than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.784 = ?

Wait, 279.2 *30=8376. So 29.784 is 30 -0.216.

So 279.2 *29.784 =279.2*(30 -0.216)=8376 - (279.2 *0.216).

279.2 *0.2=55.84.

279.2 *0.016= ~4.4672.

So 55.84 +4.4672=60.3072.

So 279.2 *29.784 ≈8376 -60.3072=8315.6928.

Which is very close to 8315.67, so 29.784 is the correct p.

So p =29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is 29.784 MeV. Since it's a massless particle, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy, so K_nu=29.784 MeV.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 +105.7^2 )

(29.784)^2 = approx 886.98.

105.7^2=11172.49.

Sum is 11172.49 + 886.98 =12059.47.

Square root of that is approximately sqrt(12059.47)≈109.8 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

So KE_mu=4.1 MeV and KE_nu=29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Did I make a mistake in any step?

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute the p with more precise numbers.

p= (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) = (19488.16 -11172.49)/279.2 =8315.67/279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29.784.

Wait, 279.2 *29.784 =?

279.2 *29=8096.8.

279.2 *0.784.

Let me compute 279.2 *0.7 =195.44.

279.2 *0.08=22.336.

279.2 *0.004=1.1168.

So 0.7+0.08+0.004=0.784.

So sum:195.44 +22.336=217.776 +1.1168=218.8928.

So 29 *279.2=8096.8.

0.784 *279.2=218.8928.

So 29.784 *279.2=8096.8 +218.8928=8315.6928 MeV².

Which matches the numerator 8315.67 MeV², so p=29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's KE is 29.784, which is approx 29.8 MeV.

Muon's KE is 4.1 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 as in option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon, \( \mu^+ \), and a neutrino, \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino is assumed to be massless (\( m_\nu = 0 \)).

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 \). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino: \( E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+} c^2 \).
2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum: \( p_{\mu^+} = -p_\nu \).

### Energy and Momentum Relations
For the muon, its total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
For the neutrino, since it is massless, its total energy equals its momentum:
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu.
\]
Let the magnitude of the momentum of both particles be \( p \). Then:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}, \quad E_\nu = p.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \( p^2 \) and rearranging:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
Substitute \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Neutrino Energy**: Since \( E_\nu = p \), the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
2. **Muon Energy**: Using \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
\[
(29.784)^2 \approx 886.98, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.98 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.47} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**: The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**: Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy:
\[
K_\nu = E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Matching with Options
The calculated kinetic energies are approximately \( K_{\mu^+} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( K_\nu = 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), which match **Option D**.
