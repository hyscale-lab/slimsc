Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question states that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The problem also mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I remember that the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Since m is small, maybe we're dealing with states where l is low, like in the ground state or an excited state with small l.

The question asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is given a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the emission line of hydrogen corresponding to the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. Let me verify that. Yeah, H-alpha is about 656 nm, wait wait no, wait 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm. Oh, that's actually the H-beta line, right? Because H-alpha is around 656 nm, H-beta is 486 nm. So the transition energy ΔE corresponds to this photon's energy.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term in the hydrogen atom's Hamiltonian is the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The term is given by something like H_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For the orbital contribution, μ is (μ_B) m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So H_Zeeman would be proportional to m*B.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term—maybe that refers to the spin-orbit coupling? Or is it the Zeeman effect? Hmm, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term", so paramagnetism is due to the magnetic moments of electrons, which are due to their spin and orbital motion. But in the context of the hydrogen atom, which has only one electron, the paramagnetic effect would involve the Zeeman term, which splits the energy levels based on m.

So the energy shift due to the magnetic field for a given m is ΔE_Zeeman = -μ_B * m * B. Since m is small, the shift would be small. But how does this compare to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom?

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is given by the photon emitted when an electron transitions between energy levels. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, so we can find the energy using the photon energy equation E = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 x 10^-9 meters.

So E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) 

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m:

1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, that's the energy in joules. To convert to electron volts (which might be more familiar), since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

So the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, what about the Zeeman energy shift? The Zeeman shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m.

Wait, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla, and m is small. Let's see, for hydrogen, the possible m values are m = -1, 0, +1 (since for the ground state, l=0, but wait no, wait. Oh wait, for l=0, m can only be 0. For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So if m is small, perhaps m=1? Or maybe considering that the problem says 'small values of m', so perhaps m is small, like m=0, but then the shift would be zero. Hmm, but paramagnetic coupling would be more for higher m. Wait, maybe for higher m, but the question says 'small' values, so perhaps m is not too large.

Wait, but in any case, for m=1, the shift would be ΔE_Zeeman= μ_B * B * m. So plugging in the numbers: 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J. Let's convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 / 1.6e-19 = approximately 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, so the Zeeman shift is about 5.8e-5 eV, while the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the ratio is (5.8e-5) / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, which is about 2e-5. So the Zeeman shift is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. So if ⟨H⟩ is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, which includes the Zeeman term, but perhaps it's specifically the Zeeman term. So in this case, ⟨H⟩ would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field, which is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much smaller than ΔE of ~2.55 eV.

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, so the correct option would be C, which says ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but wait. I'm not entirely sure about the exact factors here. Let me double-check the calculations.

First, the transition energy:

λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m.

E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) = approximately 4.088e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems right.

Now the Zeeman shift. For m=1, it's μ_B * B * m.

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T. B=1 T, m=1.

So 9.274e-24 * 1 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert to eV: 9.274e-24 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

So yes, the shift is about 0.000058 eV, which is much smaller than 2.55 eV.

So ⟨H⟩ (which is the Zeeman shift) is way less than ΔE.

So the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy shift) with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we start by analyzing the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy \( \Delta E \):**  
   The wavelength of the emitted photon is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).  
   Using the photon energy formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} = 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Zeeman Energy Shift \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \):**  
   The Zeeman term is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B B m \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength, and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number.  
   For small \( m \), say \( m = 1 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the Zeeman energy shift \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \) is approximately \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). The ratio of the two is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{5.8 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \).

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) (which corresponds to the Zeeman energy shift) is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
