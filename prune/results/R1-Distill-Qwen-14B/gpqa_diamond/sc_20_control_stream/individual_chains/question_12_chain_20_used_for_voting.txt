Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics. I’m a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, so that means it's not moving, which probably means all the energy comes from its rest mass.

Alright, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos have very tiny masses, almost zero, so I can probably consider their rest mass as negligible compared to the others. But wait, the problem says "product particles," so that's the muon and the neutrino. But the question is about the kinetic energy of each.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, in the final state, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum. That's an important point. So, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, how do I find their kinetic energies? Let me remember the energy and momentum conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c², so 139.6 MeV.

In the decay products, the muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is approximately equal to its momentum times c. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p', but since the momenta must be equal and opposite, p' = -p. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, their magnitudes are the same. So |p_muon| = |p_nu|.

Now, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is just p c, since its mass is negligible.

So, setting up the energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c

Because the neutrino's energy is p c. Let me drop the c² terms for simplicity, since the units are in MeV and we can treat c as 1 in these units. So:

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Hmm, solving for p. Let me let x = p. Then:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 )

Now square both sides:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + (105.7)^2

The x² terms cancel out on both sides:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x = (105.7)^2

Calculate 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared. Let me do that.

139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10,000. 5.7^2 is 32.49. And cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7² = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So substituting:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 x = 11172.49

Let me subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 x

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11172. Let's see: 19488 - 11172 = 8316. Then 0.16 - 0.49 would be negative, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, 19488.16 - 11172.49:

Let me subtract 11172.49 from 19488.16.

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= ?

Let me do it digit by digit.

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= ?

Starting from the right: 6 -9, can't do that, borrow. So 16 -9=7, tenths place becomes 0. Next, 0 -4: can't do that, so borrow again. 10-4=6. Then, 8 becomes 7 after borrowing? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

An alternative way: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488.16 + 0.51) - (11172.49 + 0.51) = 19488.67 - 11173.00.

Wait, maybe not. Let me compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me compute 19488.16 minus 11172. So 19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16. Then subtract the 0.49 more: 8316.16 - 0.49 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 x 

Then x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 is approximately 279 *30=8370, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2 *20=5584, plus 279.2*9=2512.8 → total 5584+2512.8=8096.8. Hmm, 29 times is 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.

Difference: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ approximately 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, that's the momentum of the muon, which is the same as the neutrino's momentum since their magnitudes are equal.

Wait, but I thought neutrino's momentum is same as muon's, but in opposite direction. So, the muon and neutrino have the same magnitude of momentum.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), which is sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute 29.783²: approximately (30-0.217)² ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 → 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 887.027.

105.7² is 11172.49 as before.

So 887.027 + 11172.49 = 12059.517.

Square root of 12059.517 is sqrt(12059) = approx 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Alternatively, the muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) → which is E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → let me compute 29.783²:

29.783 * 29.783 = let me compute 30^2 is 900. Subtract 2*30*0.217, which is 12. (Wait, 0.217 is 30 -29.783 = 0.217.)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 29.783^2:

= (30 - 0.217)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2

= 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 900 -13.02 is 886.98, plus 0.047 is 887.027.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.027 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So the muon's energy can't be higher than that, but 109.81 is less than 139.6, so that makes sense.

The neutrino's energy is p c, which is 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy is more than that, which is correct for a moving particle.

Now, the kinetic energy (KE) is the total energy minus rest mass energy. So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is its total energy since its rest mass is negligible. So KE_nu = p c ≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, let me check what's given.

Options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → seems low.

B)7.2, 32.8 → 7.2 for muon's KE? Our calculation gives about 4.11 MeV for muon's KE.

Wait, but wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the momentum calculation.

Wait, earlier I had 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 * x → x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Hmm. So muon's KE is 4.11 MeV, neutrino's KE is 29.783 MeV.

But wait, the pion's mass is 139.6. Let me check if the sum of KEs plus rest masses is correct.

Wait, the muon's KE is 4.11, so its total energy is 105.7 + 4.11 = 109.81 MeV.

Neutrino's KE is 29.783, so its energy is 29.783.

Total energy is 109.81 + 29.783 ≈ 139.59 MeV, which is about the pion's rest mass. That matches, so calculations so far seem correct.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close to our calculation.

But wait, let me double-check the initial equation. Did I set it up correctly? Let me see.

Energy conservation:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) → sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

E_nu = p c.

So, m_pi c^2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.

We divided both sides by c², so m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Wait, earlier I forgot to square the equation correctly. Let me re-do that part.

Wait, in the initial setup, I considered m_pi c² = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p c? No, wait, I think I messed up units somewhere.

Wait, no, in my initial equations, I treated all terms in MeV, so for energy, m_pi c² is 139.6 MeV. So, in the equation, 139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Wait, but wait, is p in MeV/c units? Because p c would be in MeV units. So, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but when I initially set up the equation, I think the units may have been a bit confused. Let me think again.

Let me correct the approach. Let me use units where c=1, so energy and mass are in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c. So, the equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p

Because E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

So, equation:

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + 105.7^2 ) + p

Wait, so same as before. So, I think my earlier approach was correct.

So, solving 139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

I have p ≈29.783 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + 105.7^2 ) = sqrt(887.027 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

KE_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

E_nu =29.783 MeV → KE_nu =29.783 MeV.

So the answer should be approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that makes sense.

Wait, let me check option D: "D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV". Yes, that matches.

But wait, another possibility: could the neutrino's energy be considered as E_nu = p c, but because the neutrino is also moving, perhaps the way I set up the equation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered relativistic energies for the neutrino, but since its mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p c is accurate.

So I think option D is the correct answer.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy: \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) has a negligible rest mass. 

### Energy Conservation
The total energy after the decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p,
\]
since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2},
\]
\[
(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2,
\]
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 105.7^2.
\]
Using \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 11172.49,
\]
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating \(29.783^2 = 887.027\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.027 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.517} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics. I’m a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, so that means it's not moving, which probably means all the energy comes from its rest mass.

Alright, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos have very tiny masses, almost zero, so I can probably consider their rest mass as negligible compared to the others. But wait, the problem says "product particles," so that's the muon and the neutrino. But the question is about the kinetic energy of each.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, in the final state, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum. That's an important point. So, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, how do I find their kinetic energies? Let me remember the energy and momentum conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c², so 139.6 MeV.

In the decay products, the muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is approximately equal to its momentum times c. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p', but since the momenta must be equal and opposite, p' = -p. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, their magnitudes are the same. So |p_muon| = |p_nu|.

Now, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is just p c, since its mass is negligible.

So, setting up the energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c

Because the neutrino's energy is p c. Let me drop the c² terms for simplicity, since the units are in MeV and we can treat c as 1 in these units. So:

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Hmm, solving for p. Let me let x = p. Then:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 )

Now square both sides:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + (105.7)^2

The x² terms cancel out on both sides:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x = (105.7)^2

Calculate 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared. Let me do that.

139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10,000. 5.7^2 is 32.49. And cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7² = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So substituting:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 x = 11172.49

Let me subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 x

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11172. Let's see: 19488 - 11172 = 8316. Then 0.16 - 0.49 would be negative, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, 19488.16 - 11172.49:

Let me subtract 11172.49 from 19488.16.

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= ?

Let me do it digit by digit.

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= ?

Starting from the right: 6 -9, can't do that, borrow. So 16 -9=7, tenths place becomes 0. Next, 0 -4: can't do that, so borrow again. 10-4=6. Then, 8 becomes 7 after borrowing? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

An alternative way: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488.16 + 0.51) - (11172.49 + 0.51) = 19488.67 - 11173.00.

Wait, maybe not. Let me compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me compute 19488.16 minus 11172. So 19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16. Then subtract the 0.49 more: 8316.16 - 0.49 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 x 

Then x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 is approximately 279 *30=8370, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2 *20=5584, plus 279.2*9=2512.8 → total 5584+2512.8=8096.8. Hmm, 29 times is 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.

Difference: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ approximately 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, that's the momentum of the muon, which is the same as the neutrino's momentum since their magnitudes are equal.

Wait, but I thought neutrino's momentum is same as muon's, but in opposite direction. So, the muon and neutrino have the same magnitude of momentum.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), which is sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute 29.783²: approximately (30-0.217)² ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 → 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 887.027.

105.7² is 11172.49 as before.

So 887.027 + 11172.49 = 12059.517.

Square root of 12059.517 is sqrt(12059) = approx 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Alternatively, the muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) → which is E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → let me compute 29.783²:

29.783 * 29.783 = let me compute 30^2 is 900. Subtract 2*30*0.217, which is 12. (Wait, 0.217 is 30 -29.783 = 0.217.)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 29.783^2:

= (30 - 0.217)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2

= 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 900 -13.02 is 886.98, plus 0.047 is 887.027.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.027 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So the muon's energy can't be higher than that, but 109.81 is less than 139.6, so that makes sense.

The neutrino's energy is p c, which is 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy is more than that, which is correct for a moving particle.

Now, the kinetic energy (KE) is the total energy minus rest mass energy. So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is its total energy since its rest mass is negligible. So KE_nu = p c ≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, let me check what's given.

Options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → seems low.

B)7.2, 32.8 → 7.2 for muon's KE? Our calculation gives about 4.11 MeV for muon's KE.

Wait, but wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the momentum calculation.

Wait, earlier I had 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 * x → x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Hmm. So muon's KE is 4.11 MeV, neutrino's KE is 29.783 MeV.

But wait, the pion's mass is 139.6. Let me check if the sum of KEs plus rest masses is correct.

Wait, the muon's KE is 4.11, so its total energy is 105.7 + 4.11 = 109.81 MeV.

Neutrino's KE is 29.783, so its energy is 29.783.

Total energy is 109.81 + 29.783 ≈ 139.59 MeV, which is about the pion's rest mass. That matches, so calculations so far seem correct.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close to our calculation.

But wait, let me double-check the initial equation. Did I set it up correctly? Let me see.

Energy conservation:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) → sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

E_nu = p c.

So, m_pi c^2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.

We divided both sides by c², so m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Wait, earlier I forgot to square the equation correctly. Let me re-do that part.

Wait, in the initial setup, I considered m_pi c² = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p c? No, wait, I think I messed up units somewhere.

Wait, no, in my initial equations, I treated all terms in MeV, so for energy, m_pi c² is 139.6 MeV. So, in the equation, 139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Wait, but wait, is p in MeV/c units? Because p c would be in MeV units. So, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but when I initially set up the equation, I think the units may have been a bit confused. Let me think again.

Let me correct the approach. Let me use units where c=1, so energy and mass are in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c. So, the equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p

Because E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

So, equation:

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + 105.7^2 ) + p

Wait, so same as before. So, I think my earlier approach was correct.

So, solving 139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

I have p ≈29.783 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + 105.7^2 ) = sqrt(887.027 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

KE_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

E_nu =29.783 MeV → KE_nu =29.783 MeV.

So the answer should be approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that makes sense.

Wait, let me check option D: "D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV". Yes, that matches.

But wait, another possibility: could the neutrino's energy be considered as E_nu = p c, but because the neutrino is also moving, perhaps the way I set up the equation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered relativistic energies for the neutrino, but since its mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p c is accurate.

So I think option D is the correct answer.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy: \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) has a negligible rest mass. 

### Energy Conservation
The total energy after the decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p,
\]
since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2},
\]
\[
(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2,
\]
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 105.7^2.
\]
Using \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 11172.49,
\]
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating \(29.783^2 = 887.027\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.027 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.517} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
