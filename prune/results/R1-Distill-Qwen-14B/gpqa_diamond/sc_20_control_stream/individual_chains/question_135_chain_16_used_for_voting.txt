Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f ψ_f_bar f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, let me parse that. I think the notation might be a bit tricky. The term seems to be involving the fermion fields ψ_f. The interaction is proportional to X(y), so when X couples to the fermions, it's through this term.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the fermion mass must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because in particle physics, when a particle decays, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Since the fermions are produced in pairs (like f and f_bar), each must have energy up to (mass_X)/2.

So, the condition is m_f * 2 < m_X. Let me calculate what that means. m_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Now, I need to remember the masses of the known fermions. Let me list them out:

- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way above 3 GeV)
- Electron (e^-): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ^-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, but they are leptons with very small masses.

Wait, but the fermions in the Lagrangian are ψ_f, which I assume are Dirac fermions. So, the decay X → f f_bar is allowed if the mass of f is less than 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- Quarks: up, down, strange, charm have masses well below 3 GeV. The bottom quark is 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3, so X can't decay into b quarks. Wait, wait, no, because 4.7 GeV is more than 3 GeV. So, 2m_b would be 9.4 GeV, which is way above X's mass of 6 GeV. So, X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, let me correct that. The condition is 2m_f < m_X. So, m_f must be less than m_X / 2, which is 3 GeV.

So, for quarks:

- u: 2.2 MeV << 3 GeV → allowed
- d: 4.7 MeV << 3 GeV → allowed
- s: ~95 MeV << 3 GeV → allowed
- c: ~1.5 GeV < 3 GeV → allowed
- b: 4.7 GeV > 3 GeV → not allowed
- t: way too heavy → no.

So, X can decay into u, d, s, c quarks, and all the leptons whose masses are below 3 GeV.

Leptons:

- e: 0.511 MeV → allowed
- mu: 105.7 MeV → allowed
- tau: 1.78 GeV < 3 GeV → allowed

But what about the neutrinos? The problem doesn't mention them, and the Lagrangian has fermions f, but I think the problem is considering charged leptons because the interaction is given as ψ_f. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem's Lagrangian has ψ_f, which could be any fermion, but in the decay process, the boson would decay into a pair of particles. But I think in this case, the decay would produce either quark-antiquark pairs or lepton-antilepton pairs, depending on the interaction terms.

Wait, looking back, the interaction term is -λ_f ψ_f_bar (v + X) ψ_f. So, for each fermion species f, this is a coupling. So, X can interact with any fermion f, as long as there's a coupling λ_f. But in this problem, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays. So, the issue is whether each fermion pair's combined mass is less than X's mass.

So, the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pair where each has mass less than 3 GeV. So, let's list the possible pairs.

Quarks: u, d, s, c. So, X can decay into uū, dđ, sī, cđ.

Leptons: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-. Because their masses are way below 3 GeV. Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, wait. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So, tau pairs are allowed.

Wait, no, wait: 2m_tau is 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so decay into tau pairs is allowed. Because 3.56 < 6 → yes.

Wait, but wait another thing. The mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So, each tau has about 1.78 GeV. When X (6 GeV) decays into tau+ and tau-, each tau gets about 3 GeV, which is more than their rest mass. So, it's allowed.

So, possible decay channels are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c, and b?

Wait, no. Because for b quarks, 2m_b = 2 * 4.7 = 9.4 GeV, which is way more than X's mass of 6. So, no, b quarks are too heavy for X to decay into b b-bar.

So, allowed quarks are u, d, s, c.

Leptons: e, μ, τ are allowed as their masses are below 3 GeV.

So, possible decays are:

X → uū, dđ, sī, cđ, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e-. Wait, but if X can't decay into b, then option A is wrong.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So, that's correct for the quarks (c is allowed, but not b), and includes the leptons. So, B is looking promising.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So, correct quarks (c is allowed, and the others), and the leptons are all allowed.

Option C includes top quarks, which are way too heavy. So C is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the interaction term provided and the mass of \( X \), which is \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy the condition \( 2m_f < m_X \). This ensures that the total energy of the decay products does not exceed the mass of the decaying particle.

### Step 1: Fermion Masses and Decay Constraints
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- Electron (\( e^- \)): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) to decay into \( f \bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f < m_X \) must hold. Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum allowed fermion mass is \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This eliminates the \( b \)-quark (\( m_b \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \)-quark (\( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) as possible decay products.

### Step 2: Allowed Decay Channels
The allowed fermion pairs are those with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \):
- **Quarks**: \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \)
- **Leptons**: \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \)

### Step 3: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.
