Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B choices.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed via nucleophilic substitution reactions. Butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, when ketones react with something like HCN, they form cyanohydrins. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation reaction. That's where a ketone reacts with hydrogen cyanide (or a cyanide ion) in the presence of an acid catalyst, leading to the formation of a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group attached.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. But wait, NaCN would provide CN- ions. For the cyanohydrin formation, I think you typically use HCN, but sometimes under certain conditions, the CN- can act as a nucleophile. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe the reaction needs an acid catalyst.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yes, that's a cyanohydrin.

In the cyanohydrin reaction, the ketone (RCOR') reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. The CN- then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an O- which picks up a proton. So in this case, perhaps the NaCN is providing the CN-, but maybe the solution is acidic because the reaction needs an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent A is the catalyst here. So if the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product, then A must be an acid catalyst. So A is probably H3O+ (like sulfuric acid, but H3O+ is a general acid). Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

But wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm trying to remember what reactions involve that. Oh right, bisulfite can be used in the hydroxy group formation, like maybe the reduction of a carbonyl group. But in this case, it's a substitution with CN-.

So the first reaction, I think, requires an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

How do you convert nitriles to carboxylic acids? I recall that typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. One common method is hydrolysis under acidic conditions, like with H2SO4 and H2O, followed by oxidation, or perhaps using HCl in H2O. Alternatively, in the presence of a strong acid, maybe HCl, and heat, the nitrile can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis: in acidic conditions, nitriles (R-C≡N) can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. The reaction generally requires strong acid and heat. For example, using HCl in water as the reagent.

So in the second reaction, B is the reagent. The product is a carboxylic acid, so B should be HCl, as H+ and Cl- would provide the acidic environment for hydrolysis.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → So first reaction uses acid (H3O+), second uses HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → Using acetic acid as the catalyst in the second reaction. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weaker acid. Would it be strong enough for the nitrile hydrolysis? I'm not too sure, but I think HCl is more likely.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → So the first reaction uses NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about. The second uses HCl, which seems right for the hydrolysis.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → Hmm, not as sure about this.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. If A is H3O+, then the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So option A and B are possibilities.

But wait, in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN. So perhaps we're using an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen. Once the ketone is protonated, the CN- (from NaCN) can attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So yes, A is H3O+ (so options A and B are possible for the first part). Now, for the second reaction, the nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Another thought: sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides first, and then oxidized to acids. But under strong acidic conditions, I think the nitrile can directly hydrolyze to the acid.

So the second reaction would require an acid catalyst, likely HCl (B is HCl). So looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, which fits.

Wait, but what about the first reaction. Are there other possibilities? Could reagent A be something else?

Alternatively, if reagent A is NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^- ions. I'm trying to think of reactions where HSO3^- is involved. Oh, I think it's used in the hydroboration reaction? No, maybe in the formation of bisulfite addition products, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, in the cyanohydrin reaction, the acid is H3O+. So the first reaction probably uses H3O+ as A, making options A and B as possible.

So for the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So HCl (as in option A) would be suitable. Therefore, the correct option would be A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another thought: if the first reagent is H3O+, which is a strong acid, but sometimes, in some cases, NaHSO3 is used as a source of H+ because it's a weaker acid. Hmm.

Wait, when NaHSO3 is present, it can act as a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. I think the first reaction requires an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

So, putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (B is HCl). Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait another thing, the second reaction: the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, but in the product, it's a butanoic acid. So the nitrile group becomes a COOH group. That suggests that the nitrile underwent hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Another method for nitrile to acid is hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions. So it's typically done with HCl (concentrated) and H2O, heat.

So the reagent B would be HCl.

So, that brings us back to option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid catalyst. The second reaction uses HCl as the acid for hydrolysis.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, when you have nitriles and you treat them with dilute acid and water, especially in the presence of something like KMnO4, you can oxidize the nitrile to the acid. But in this case, B is H2O and B is the reagent. So perhaps B is HCl with H2O.

Wait, the second reaction is: reagent B (H2O) is present. So B is the reagent that's added, perhaps in water. So B is HCl, which would make the solution acidic, allowing the hydrolysis.

So, the answer should be option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the CN⁻ ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable catalyst for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic environment.

The second reaction converts a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. This typically involves hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions. HCl in water is a common reagent for this transformation, as it provides the acidic environment and the protons required for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, HCl is the appropriate reagent for the second reaction.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weaker acid) is not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not typically used as a catalyst for cyanohydrin formation, making this option unsuitable for the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
