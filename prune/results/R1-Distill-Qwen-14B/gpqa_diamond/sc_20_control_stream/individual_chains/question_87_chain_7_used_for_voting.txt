Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Hmm, wait. The aromatic ring is 6-membered, di-substituted. So, two substituents on the benzene ring. Also, total 8 carbons. The benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Or wait, no—because the substituents can have multiple carbons each. Let me think.

Wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene, then each substituent is attached to the ring. Let's see. The total number of carbons is 8. So, the benzene (6C) plus substituents (2C). So each substituent has one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none, but I don't think that's possible since di-substituted implies two substituents.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is -CO- something. Because the FTIR has a carbonyl group. So maybe one substituent is an acyl group, like an ester or ketone. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond. So one of the substituents must be a halogen, like Cl, Br, I.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on the benzene ring can be a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, that would only add two substituents, each with one atom (if the substituent is a single atom like Cl). But wait, substituents can have more atoms. Oh, but for carbon count, the substituents contribute their carbon atoms.

Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2. So substituents could be two groups each with one carbon. But wait, substituents like -CH2- groups? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl, which is a functional group but might not add a carbon. Wait, wait no: a substituent like -COOR would add more carbons.

Hmm, maybe I should think about possible structures. Let's see, the molecule is di-substituted benzene, so two substituents attached. The FTIR has a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen (like Ar-X). So, one substituent must be a halogen, and another must be a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but wait, halogens are substituents with one atom—like -Cl, -Br. They don't contribute a carbon. So if one substituent is a -X (X is halogen), and the other is a carbonyl group, which would contribute a carbon. Let's see.

So the substituents are:

1. -X (no carbons)
2. -CO-something (maybe an ester, ketone, etc.)

Wait, but the total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. Benzene is 6, substituents add 2. So substituent 2 must have 2 carbons? Or maybe substituent 2 is a carbonyl group with one carbon, and substituent 1 is a halogen (0 carbons). So, substituent 2 would be, say, -COCH3 (acetophenone-like). But wait, that would add two carbons (the CO and CH3). Wait, no: the CO is one carbon (the carbonyl carbon), plus the CH3 is another. So substituent 2 is -COCH3, which is two carbons. Substituent 1 is -X (no carbons). So total substituents would add two carbons, making the total 6 (benzene) + 2 = 8.

Ah, that makes sense. So the structure would be something like para-substituted benzene with groups -X and -COCH3. Or maybe ortho or meta, but likely para for symmetry.

Wait, but what's the structure of the compound? Let me think. So, benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl), the other is a ketone group (COCH3). So the molecule would be, say, para-chloroacetophenone.

Wait, but wait. Acetophenone has a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3). If there's a Cl substituent, then it's para to the COCH3 group.

So, in this case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons. Let me think about the splitting.

If the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets for each substituent. Because in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent to each substituent.

Wait, in para substitution, the ring is symmetric. So the two substituents are opposite each other. So each substituent has two adjacent protons, which are equivalent. So in the NMR, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating for 2H.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite. So, between the two substituents, there are two positions each with two protons. So each substituent is flanked by two Hs, but in para they're all equivalent. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

No, wait. For a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Because the substituents cause the ring to have symmetry. So each substituent is opposite the other, and the adjacent protons would be in two doublets. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a specific example.

Take para-dichlorobenzene. It has two Cl atoms opposite each other. The ring has four equivalent Hs, each between the Cl substituents. So in that case, the NMR would show a singlet because all four Hs are equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, no, the Hs would be in two sets of two, each adjacent to a Cl. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about ortho, meta, para. For two substituents, like X and Y, in the para positions. Let's imagine positions 1 and 3 on the benzene ring. Wait no, para is positions 1 and 4. So substituent X is at position 1, substituent Y at position 4. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to X, and protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Y. But since X and Y are different, the protons next to X (positions 2 and 6) would be a doublet, and the protons next to Y (3 and 5) would be another doublet. So in the NMR, two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Wait, that makes sense. So in this case, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each 2H. Each is split into a doublet because each proton is adjacent to another set of protons. Alternatively, maybe each is a doublet because of coupling with each other.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, then each substituent's adjacent Hs are equivalent. So for the X group (say, Cl), the adjacent Hs would be at positions 2 and 6. For the Y group (say, COCH3), the adjacent Hs would be at positions 3 and 5. So in the NMR, each would split into a doublet.

So the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So aromatic region has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That matches with two doublets, each 2H. But the 9.9 (1H, s) is a singlet. Wait, where would that come from? Maybe an aldehyde proton, but we have a carbonyl group (from FTIR). Or perhaps an aromatic proton that's deshielded, but in the para-substituted case, all aromatic Hs should be in two doublets. Hmm, but this option has a singlet in the aromatic region, which doesn't fit. So maybe option A isn't correct.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic region has two doublets, each 2H. The 2.3 ppm singlet is probably a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl, like in an acetophenone. So that fits. Because the COCH3 would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3. So this seems promising.

Wait, but let's look at the substituents again. If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the aromatic region would have two doublets. But how does that affect the integration? Each substituent would have two adjacent protons. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So option C has that.

But wait, the carbonyl peak in the IR. So the compound should have a ketone (COCH3) which would show up around 1700 cm^-1. So that's present.

Now, what about the NMR of the COCH3 group? The CH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl and no neighboring Hs to split it. So in option C, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which fits.

So option C looks correct. But let me check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The aromatic region has a singlet at 6.9. That doesn't seem to fit with the expected two doublets. Unless it's a different substitution pattern, like one substituent is meta, but I think earlier we thought para is more likely.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These are more like OCH2 groups, perhaps in an ester or ether. Doesn't fit with aromatic protons being prominent.

So looking back, the correct NMR should show two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and a singlet for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So option C matches that.

Wait, but wait. The substituents: if one is Cl and the other is COCH3, the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded (downfield) than those adjacent to the ketone. So the doublet at higher ppm (7.8) would be from the Cl-adjacent Hs, and the lower ppm (7.6) would be from the ketone-adjacent Hs. Because Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, making the adjacent Hs more deshielded and appear downfield, while the ketone is also electron-withdrawing but maybe less so than Cl? Or wait, the ketone (being a strong EWG) would also cause deshielding.

Wait, perhaps the substituent with the stronger EWG will cause the adjacent Hs to be more downfield. Cl is a stronger EDG than a ketone? No, Cl is an EWG when attached to benzene. Wait, Cl is ortho/para-directing because it's an EWG, but the COCH3 is also EWG and meta-directing. Hmm, but in any case, the substituents' effect on the chemical shift would influence the positions.

But in any case, option C's aromatic region has two doublets, which would correspond to the two substituents. The downfield shift would be higher for the Cl adjacent Hs.

So I think option C is the correct answer.

The question involves identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The compound has a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is a halogen (e.g., Cl), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, likely a ketone (e.g., COCH3). This structure is consistent with the total carbon count: 6 carbons from the benzene ring and 2 carbons from the substituents.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The aromatic region shows two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), each integrating for 2H, which matches the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene. However, the singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H) does not fit the expected structure, as there is no aldehyde proton or equivalent in the compound. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest the presence of OCH2 groups, which are not consistent with the expected substituents (halogen and carbonyl group). Additionally, the absence of prominent aromatic signals makes this option unlikely. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), each integrating for 2H, which aligns with the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3), which is consistent with the compound's structure. This option matches the expected NMR data.

4. **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H) does not fit the expected aromatic splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest the presence of OCH2 groups, which are not part of the expected substituents. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct 1H NMR data corresponds to Option C, as it accurately reflects the aromatic splitting pattern (two doublets for the para-substituted benzene) and includes a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Hmm, wait. The aromatic ring is 6-membered, di-substituted. So, two substituents on the benzene ring. Also, total 8 carbons. The benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Or wait, no—because the substituents can have multiple carbons each. Let me think.

Wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene, then each substituent is attached to the ring. Let's see. The total number of carbons is 8. So, the benzene (6C) plus substituents (2C). So each substituent has one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none, but I don't think that's possible since di-substituted implies two substituents.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is -CO- something. Because the FTIR has a carbonyl group. So maybe one substituent is an acyl group, like an ester or ketone. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond. So one of the substituents must be a halogen, like Cl, Br, I.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on the benzene ring can be a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, that would only add two substituents, each with one atom (if the substituent is a single atom like Cl). But wait, substituents can have more atoms. Oh, but for carbon count, the substituents contribute their carbon atoms.

Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2. So substituents could be two groups each with one carbon. But wait, substituents like -CH2- groups? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl, which is a functional group but might not add a carbon.

Wait, but wait, halogens are substituents with one atom—like -Cl, -Br. They don't contribute a carbon. So if one substituent is a -X (X is halogen), and the other is a carbonyl group, which would contribute a carbon. Let's see.

So the substituents are:

1. -X (no carbons)
2. -CO-something (maybe an ester, ketone, etc.)

Wait, but the total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. Benzene is 6, substituents add 2. So substituent 2 must have 2 carbons? Or maybe substituent 2 is a carbonyl group with one carbon, and substituent 1 is a halogen (0 carbons). So, substituent 2 would be, say, -COCH3 (acetophenone-like). But wait, that would add two carbons (the CO and CH3). Wait, no: the CO is one carbon (the carbonyl carbon), plus the CH3 is another. So substituent 2 is -COCH3, which is two carbons. Substituent 1 is -X (no carbons). So total substituents would add two carbons, making the total 6 (benzene) + 2 = 8.

Ah, that makes sense. So the structure would be something like para-substituted benzene with groups -X and -COCH3. Or maybe ortho or meta, but likely para for symmetry.

Wait, but what's the structure of the compound? Let me think. So, benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl), the other is a ketone group (COCH3). So the molecule would be, say, para-chloroacetophenone.

Wait, but wait. Acetophenone has a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3). If there's a Cl substituent, then it's para to the COCH3 group.

So, in this case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons. Let me think about the splitting.

If the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets for each substituent. Because in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent to each substituent.

Wait, in para substitution, the ring is symmetric. So the two substituents are opposite each other. So each substituent has two adjacent protons, which are equivalent. So in the NMR, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating for 2H.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite. So, between the two substituents, there are two positions each with two protons. So each substituent is flanked by two Hs, but in para they're all equivalent. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

No, wait. For a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Because the substituents cause the ring to have symmetry. So each substituent is opposite the other, and the adjacent protons would be in two doublets. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a specific example.

Take para-dichlorobenzene. It has two Cl atoms opposite each other. The ring has four equivalent Hs, each between the Cl substituents. So in that case, the NMR would show a singlet because all four Hs are equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, no, the Hs would be in two sets of two, each adjacent to a Cl. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about ortho, meta, para. For two substituents, like X and Y, in the para positions. Let's imagine positions 1 and 3 on the benzene ring. Wait no, para is positions 1 and 4. So substituent X is at position 1, substituent Y at position 4. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to X, and protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Y. But since X and Y are different, the protons next to X (positions 2 and 6) would be a doublet, and the protons next to Y (3 and 5) would be another doublet. So in the NMR, two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Wait, that makes sense. So in this case, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each 2H. Each is split into a doublet because each proton is adjacent to another set of protons. Alternatively, maybe each is a doublet because of coupling with each other.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, then each substituent's adjacent Hs are equivalent. So for the X group (say, Cl), the adjacent Hs would be at positions 2 and 6. For the Y group (say, COCH3), the adjacent Hs would be at positions 3 and 5. So in the NMR, each would split into a doublet.

So the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So aromatic region has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That matches with two doublets, each 2H. But the 9.9 (1H, s) is a singlet. Wait, where would that come from? Maybe an aldehyde proton, but we have a carbonyl group (from FTIR). Or perhaps an aromatic proton that's deshielded, but in the para-substituted case, all aromatic Hs should be in two doublets. Hmm, but this option has a singlet in the aromatic region, which doesn't fit. So maybe option A isn't correct.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic region has two doublets, each 2H. The 2.3 ppm singlet is probably a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl, like in an acetophenone. So that fits. Because the COCH3 would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3. So this seems promising.

Wait, but let's look at the substituents again. If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the aromatic region would have two doublets. But how does that affect the integration? Each substituent would have two adjacent protons. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So option C has that.

But wait, the carbonyl peak in the IR. So the compound should have a ketone (COCH3) which would show up around 1700 cm^-1. So that's present.

Now, what about the NMR of the COCH3 group? The CH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl and no neighboring Hs to split it. So in option C, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which fits.

So option C looks correct. But let me check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The aromatic region has a singlet at 6.9. That doesn't seem to fit with the expected two doublets. Unless it's a different substitution pattern, like one substituent is meta, but I think earlier we thought para is more likely.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These are more like OCH2 groups, perhaps in an ester or ether. Doesn't fit with aromatic protons being prominent.

So looking back, the correct NMR should show two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and a singlet for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So option C matches that.

Wait, but wait. The substituents: if one is Cl and the other is COCH3, the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded (downfield) than those adjacent to the ketone. So the doublet at higher ppm (7.8) would be from the Cl-adjacent Hs, and the lower ppm (7.6) would be from the ketone-adjacent Hs. Because Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, making the adjacent Hs more deshielded and appear downfield, while the ketone is also electron-withdrawing but maybe less so than Cl? Or wait, the ketone (being a strong EWG) would also cause deshielding.

Wait, perhaps the substituent with the stronger EWG will cause the adjacent Hs to be more downfield. Cl is a stronger EDG than a ketone? No, Cl is an EWG when attached to benzene. Wait, Cl is ortho/para-directing because it's an EWG, but the COCH3 is also EWG and meta-directing. Hmm, but in any case, the substituents' effect on the chemical shift would influence the positions.

But in any case, option C's aromatic region has two doublets, which would correspond to the two substituents. The downfield shift would be higher for the Cl adjacent Hs.

So I think option C is the correct answer.


The question involves identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total.
