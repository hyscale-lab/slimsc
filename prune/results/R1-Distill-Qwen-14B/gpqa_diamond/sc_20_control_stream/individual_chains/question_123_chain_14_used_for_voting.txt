Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in relativity, I need to think about how time and distance transform between them. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, so maybe I can use the Galilean transformations here because they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but wait, no, wait. The speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me think about that.

Wait, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. Oh, so that's 20% the speed of light. So it's a fairly high speed, but not relativistic enough for special relativity effects to be dominant? Wait, but when objects are moving at speeds where v is a significant fraction of c, you can't just ignore relativity. Hmm, but the question is asking about the distance in the galaxy's frame when a certain time passes in the ejecta's frame. Oh, wait, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. Because in the galaxy's frame, it's stationary and the ejecta is moving towards it. So the question is, in the galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the time that 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but time in different frames isn't the same. Because of time dilation, right? So the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is different from the time in the galaxy's frame. So I can't just multiply 60,000 km/s by 50 seconds because that would be the distance in the galaxy's frame if the time were the same, but actually, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer. Wait, no—wait, actually, I'm getting this backward. Let me think.

In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the center is moving towards them. So when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds have passed, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?

Wait, but the problem is asking, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards them. So let's denote:

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s.

Galaxy's frame: time is t. Ejecta's frame: time is t'. The problem says t' is 50 seconds.

We need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame, so distance is v * t.

But wait, t is not 50 seconds. Because t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame. So how do we relate t and t'?

In special relativity, the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but this is when the event is happening in the same place in the moving frame. Or is it when the event is in the same location in the rest frame? Hmm.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it. So the galaxy's center is moving, so the two frames are moving relative to each other. The proper time is the time measured in the same place in the same frame. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds have passed, then in the galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is longer.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say in the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. So in their frame, when 50 seconds (t') have passed, the galaxy's center has moved a distance of v * t' = 6e4 km/s * 50 s = 3e6 km. But wait, that's the distance in the ejecta's frame. But the question is about the distance in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, wait. The problem is asking, what is the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity and time. The velocity in the galaxy's frame is v=6e4 km/s. But the time in the galaxy's frame is longer because of time dilation. So I need to find the time t in the galaxy's frame corresponding to t' =50 s in the ejecta's frame.

So, using time dilation formula: t' = t / gamma => t = gamma * t'

Alternatively, wait, I might have it the other way around. Let me make sure. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the event occurs at the same place. So the proper time is the time in the frame where the two events (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same point. In this scenario, the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the event of the galaxy's center moving a certain distance happens at the same point (the ejecta's position), so t' is the proper time. So yes, t' is the proper time, and t = gamma * t'

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Let's compute that.

v = 6e4 km/s = 6e4 *1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, no: wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. To convert to m/s, since 1 km is 1e3 m, so 6e4 km/s = 6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s.

Wait the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v =6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v² = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15 m²/s².

c²= (3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s².

So (v^2)/(c^2) = 3.6e15 /9e16 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.04=0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(0.96) = approx 0.9798.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So in the galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is about 51.03 seconds.

So the distance the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s.

Wait, let me compute that: 60,000 km/s *51.03 s =60,000 *51.03 km.

60,000 *50=3,000,000 km.

60,000 *1.03=61,800 km.

So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, close, but perhaps I should be more precise in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let's calculate v^2/c^2.

v=6e4 km/s =60,000 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s=6e7 m/s.

v^2= (6e7)^2=3.6e15 m²/s².

c=3e8 m/s, so c^2=9e16 m²/s².

v²/c²=3.6e15/9e16= (3.6/9) * 1e-1 =0.4 *0.1=0.04.

So 1 -0.04=0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10.

sqrt(96)= approximately 9.798.

So sqrt(0.96)=0.9798.

So gamma=1/0.9798 ≈1.02066.

Then t=gamma * t' = 1.02066 *50 ≈51.033 s.

So v *t =6e4 km/s *51.033 s = ?

6e4 km/s *50 s =3e6 km.

6e4 km/s *1.033 s =6e4 *1.033=61,980 km.

Wait, 6e4 is 60,000, so 60,000 *1.033 =60,000*(1 +0.033) =60,000 +1980=61,980 km.

So total distance is 3e6 +61,980 =3,061,980 km.

Looking at the options, the closest one is D) 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Maybe because I'm not considering the exact gamma value.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96)=?

Let me compute 0.96^0.5.

I can use the Taylor series approximation for sqrt(x) around x=1.

sqrt(1 - a) ≈ 1 - a/2 - a²/8 for small a.

Here, a=0.04.

So sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1-0.04)=1 -0.04/2 - (0.04)^2/8.

=1 -0.02 - 0.0016/8.

Wait, 0.04^2 is 0.0016.

So 0.0016/8 =0.0002.

So sqrt(0.96)≈1 -0.02 -0.0002=0.9798.

Same as before.

So gamma is about 1.0206.

So t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s.

So v*t=6e4 *51.03.

Wait, 6e4 *51.03 =6e4 *51 +6e4 *0.03.

6e4 *51 =60,000 *51 =3,060,000 km.

6e4 *0.03=1,800 km.

So total is 3,060,000 +1,800=3,061,800 km.

But none of the options exactly match. The options are A)2,940,000; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.

Hmm, 3,061,800 is approximately 3,062,000 km, but the options have D as 3,060,000. So perhaps the approximation is expected, or perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with Galilean transformations, ignoring relativity.

Wait, wait. If we ignore relativity, meaning we treat the frames as Galilean (non-relativistic), then time is the same in both frames. So the elapsed time in the galaxy's frame is also 50 seconds.

So in that case, distance would be v * t =6e4 km/s *50 s=3e6 km. So that's option B.

But why would the problem mention that the frames are inertial, and yet not require using relativity? Hmm, because the speed is high, but perhaps the question expects a Galilean approach.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because the problem says both are inertial frames, but doesn't specify whether to use relativity.

Wait, the question is likely expecting a Newtonian approach, because otherwise, the answer wouldn't match any given option. Wait, the options include 3 million (option B, which is 3e6 km), which is exactly 6e4 km/s *50 s. But if you include time dilation, it's a bit more.

Wait, the problem states that both the ejecta part and the galaxy are inertial frames. So in that case, according to Newtonian physics, velocity is simply v, and time is the same in both frames. So distance in galaxy's frame is v *t, where t is 50 seconds.

So 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But why did the problem mention that the frames are inertial? Well, Newtonian mechanics require inertial frames, but that's probably just setting up the scenario.

Wait, but wait, the problem says: 'from the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?'

Wait, so the time given is in the ejecta frame. So the time in the galaxy frame is longer because of time dilation. So the correct approach is to calculate the distance as v multiplied by the dilated time, which gives 3,061,800 km. But none of the options match that exactly. The closest is D)3,060,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simple multiplication without considering relativity, leading to 3 million km.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So perhaps it's intended to use Galilean transformations, making the answer option B.

But wait, 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So if we use Newtonian physics, we'd be making a big approximation. But perhaps the problem expects that, as it's a multiple-choice and the options don't include a relativistic answer.

Wait, let me recheck the options. The options are A:2,940,000; B:3,000,000; C:2,880,000; D:3,060,000.

So, if correct relativistic calculation gives ~3,061,800 km, which is about 3.06e6 km. Option D is 3.06e6 km.

Wait, the problem says 'when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.' So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. In the galaxy's frame, that's a longer time. So the distance is velocity multiplied by the longer time.

So, using the correct gamma, the distance is approximately 3,061,800 km, which would round to the nearest option as D)3,060,000 km.

Wait, but wait, the options list D as 3,060,000, which is exactly 3.06e6 km. So perhaps the textbook expects the non-relativistic approach, but in reality, the correct answer should consider relativity. Hmm, but why then is the option D present?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider time dilation, and the distance is simply v*t. So 60,000 km/s *50 s =3e6 km. So option B.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. The problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests that we're to use Newtonian physics, but the speed is relativistic. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the fact that in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and over 50 seconds (as experienced in the galaxy's frame), the distance would be 3e6 km. But no, because the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, now I'm more confused. Let me approach it from another angle.

From the ejecta's frame:

- The galaxy center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s.

- They observe the time as 50 seconds.

So, from the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy has moved a distance of v * t' =6e4 *50 =3e6 km.

But the question is asking how much the ejecta has moved in the galaxy's frame. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 6e4 km/s.

But the time experienced in the galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds, because of time dilation.

So the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

Which gives t ≈51.033 s.

So the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t =6e4 *51.033 ≈3,061,980 km.

Which is approximately 3.062e6 km, but the options don't have that. The closest option is D:3,060,000 km.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

But wait, the options don't have the precise value. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic approach but to compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60,000^2 *1e6) / (3e5^2 *1e6)).

Wait, wait, let's compute v and c in km/s:

v=60,000 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s (wait, no: the speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, which is 300,000 km/s).

Wait, wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s =300,000 km/s.

So beta = v/c =6e4 /3e5 = 0.2.

So beta =0.2.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.04) =1/sqrt(0.96)≈1.0206.

So t= gamma * t'=1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So distance in galaxy's frame is v * t =6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.

Which is approximately 3.06e6 km.

Which is very close to option D:3,060,000 km.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is option B) present? Because some might think to multiply 6e4 *50 without considering time dilation.

But the problem states that both frames are inertial, but doesn't specify to ignore relativity. So perhaps the intended answer is B, but the correct approach is to use relativity and get D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Because proper time is the time measured in the moving frame when two events happen at the same place in that frame.

In this case, the two events are the start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame. These two events (ejecta being at a certain point at time 0 and at another point after 50 seconds) happen at the same location in the ejecta's frame. So t' is the proper time, and t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

So the correct approach is to use t=gamma t', leading to the longer time, and hence a longer distance.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and the problem specifies that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame of reference. The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, we use the time dilation formula from special relativity to relate the proper time (\( t' \)) in the ejecta's frame to the time (\( t \)) in the Galaxy's frame:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Calculating \( \gamma \)**:  
   The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{60,000}{300,000} = 0.2
   \]
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

3. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using \( t = \gamma t' \), the time in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

4. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

5. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value to \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The relativistic calculation shows that the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), making **Option D** the correct answer.

Answer: D
