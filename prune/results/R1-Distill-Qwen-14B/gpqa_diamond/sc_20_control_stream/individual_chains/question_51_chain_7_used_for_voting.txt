Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think about what I know.

The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, right, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves interactions between charges, and since the sphere is conducting, I remember some things about how charges distribute on conductors.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. But if the sphere is neutral initially, when another charge is placed near it, how does that affect it?

I think when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the charges on the sphere redistribute. But since it's grounded, the sphere might not have any net charge; it would just have induced charges on its surface. Wait, no, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can leave or enter the sphere. So maybe the sphere's net charge remains zero? Or does the presence of the external charge induce charges on the sphere?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. For a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface. If the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can adjust because the sphere can exchange charges with the ground. So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's surface would have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere might remain zero. Or is it that the sphere can have a net charge if it's not grounded, but when grounded, it's neutral? Hmm.

Wait, no. The sphere is grounded, so if the charge q is placed near it, the sphere can have induced charges. But since it's a conductor, the induced charges will separate such that the inside of the conductor (the cavity) has no electric field. But wait, the sphere is solid, isn't it? No, wait, it's a conducting sphere, so the charge can move freely on the surface.

So when an external charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. The external charge will induce opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced opposite charges can flow into the ground, making the sphere have a net charge equal to the induced same charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sphere is neutral to start with. When you place a charge q near it, the sphere's surface will have induced charges: negative charges near q and positive charges on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the negative charges can leave the sphere through the ground, so the sphere will end up with a net positive charge equal to q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. If the external charge is positive, the sphere's near side has negative induced charges, and the far side has positive induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the negative charges can flow away, so the sphere's net charge would be positive because the positive induced charges can't leave (since the sphere is a conductor, but the ground can't provide positive charges). Wait, no, wait. The ground is at zero potential, so it can accept or provide electrons. So if the sphere has negative charges induced, they can flow into the ground (ground provides electrons, so the sphere loses negative charges). So the sphere's surface would have positive charges induced. But wait, the sum of induced charges would be zero because the sphere was neutral.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the method of images. In the method of images for a grounded sphere, the induced charges can be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the position d away from the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. Hmm, that might help.

Wait, so the potential energy U is the work done in assembling this configuration. So when you bring charge q from infinity to a distance d from the center of the sphere, you're doing work against the electric field. But the sphere being grounded complicates things because it can have induced charges which affect the potential.

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, any charges induced on it can move, but the overall potential of the sphere's surface is zero. So when you bring the charge q near, the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to both the sphere and the charge itself?

Wait, maybe another approach. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each part. But when you have two charges, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of the charges times the potential each charge creates at the location of the other.

But here, the sphere is neutral but conducting, so the charges are on the surface. So the potential at the location of q due to the sphere and vice versa.

Wait, but how to model the potential due to the sphere. For a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. Since it's grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere (which is zero) plus the potential due to q itself. Wait, no, because the sphere is a conductor, the potential outside the sphere is as if all its charge were at the center. But in this case, the sphere is neutral, so the external potential due to the sphere is zero. So the potential at the location of q is just the potential due to q itself, but since the sphere is neutral, maybe that's zero. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think of the potential energy of the system as the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so it can adjust its induced charges, which effectively means the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, maybe using the concept of capacitance. The sphere can be considered as a capacitor with the point charge. The sphere, being a conductor, can be thought of as having a self-capacitance, but when another charge is near it, the capacitance changes. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this approach.

Alternatively, think about the image method. For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge for a point charge outside the sphere is located at a distance from the center such that r' = R^2 / d, where R is the sphere's radius and d is the distance of the external charge from the center. The image charge q' is negative and has a magnitude dependent on the external charge and the distance.

Wait, right! The method of images says that a conducting sphere can be modeled by placing an image charge inside the sphere. For a grounded sphere, the image charge is inside, and its magnitude is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

So, for a point charge q located at distance d from the center of a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance d' from the center towards the charge. The image charge's magnitude is (R^2 / d) * q. Wait, no, I think the image charge is (R^2 / (d - R)) * q or something similar.

Wait, no, the formula I remember for the image charge when the sphere is non-grounded is different, but when it's grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is given by (R^2 / (d)) * q, but I'm not exactly sure about the formula. Alternatively, the image charge's distance from the center is (R^2)/d.

Wait, let me think. When the sphere is grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is such that the potential at the surface of the sphere is zero. So the potential due to q and q' at the surface should cancel. So the potential due to q is k q / R (since the sphere's radius is R), and the image charge q' is located at a distance x from the center, towards the charge q. Then the potential due to q' at the surface is k q' / (R - x). But since the sphere is grounded, the sum of these potentials is zero. So:

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance from the image charge to the surface is R - x, where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. So, the potential from the external charge and the image charge at the surface must sum to zero.

So, V_external = k q / R

V_image = k q' / (R - x)

So,

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact setup. Maybe another approach: the image charge q' for a grounded sphere is given by q' = - q (R/d)², and the distance from the center is x = R²/d.

Wait, that sounds familiar. So for a point charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge inside the sphere is q' = - (R^2 / d^2) q, located at a distance x = R^2 / d from the center, along the line connecting the center and the external charge.

Wait, let me check: If d is the distance from the external charge to the center, then the image charge is at x = R² / (d - R) ? Hmm, perhaps I should look up the image charge formula again. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I think.

So, the image charge q' is - (R² / d) q, and it's located at a distance x = R² / d from the center towards the external charge.

Wait, no, perhaps it's (R² / (d - R)) * q? Hmm, this is getting a bit fuzzy. Alternatively, I think the image charge for a grounded sphere is given by q' = - (R² / d) q, located at x = R² / d from the center. So at a point that's closer than the original charge.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential. The potential on the sphere's surface must be zero because it's grounded. The potential due to the external charge q is k q / R. The potential due to the image charge q' at the surface is k q' / (R - x), where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. So:

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

But x is the distance from the center to the image charge. So if the image charge is inside the sphere, x must be less than R. Wait, but if the external charge is at d > R, which it is, then the image charge is inside.

Wait, let me think: the image charge is inside the sphere, so x < R. So the distance from the image charge to the surface is R - x.

So:

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

But the image charge's location is x = R² / d.

Wait, if d is the distance from the external charge to the center, then the image charge is at x = R²/(d) from the center. Hmm, but if d is larger than R, then x would be smaller than R, which makes sense because the image is inside.

So, substituting x = R²/d,

k q / R + k q' / (R - (R²/d)) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (R - (R²/d)):

k q (R - (R²/d)) / R + k q' = 0.

Simplify:

k q [ (R d - R²) / (R d) ) ] + k q' = 0

Wait, perhaps a better way is to substitute x = R²/d into the previous equation.

So,

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

x = R²/d,

So,

k q / R + k q' / (R - R²/d) = 0.

Let me compute R - R²/d: R(1 - R/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So,

k q / R + k q' * d/( R (d - R) ) )= 0.

Factor out k:

k [ q/R + q' * d/( R (d - R) ) ] = 0.

Divide both sides by k:

q/R + q' * d/( R (d - R) ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by R:

q + q' * d/(d - R) = 0.

Solve for q':

q' * d/(d - R) = - q.

q' = - q (d - R)/d.

So,

q' = - q (d - R)/d.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I messed up the image charge formula.

Wait, but another way: the image charge method for a grounded sphere. The image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, where r' = R² / d. But wait, that would be the case when the sphere is uncharged. But since it's grounded, perhaps the image charge is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of potential energy.

The potential energy U of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere, considering the potential due to the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at the point d is due to the charge q itself? But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere and due to itself. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at q's location is due to the sphere (which is zero) plus the potential due to q. So that's just zero? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is the product of the charge q and the potential at its location due to all other sources. The potential at q's location due to the sphere is zero (since the sphere's surface is at zero potential, and for a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface). So the potential at q's location is due to the sphere (zero) and q itself, but that's a bit circular.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charges. So when you bring charge q near the sphere, you have to do work against the electric field created by any induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced negative charges can flow into the ground, leaving the sphere with induced positive charges.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral. So when you bring a positive charge q near it, the sphere's near side will have negative induced charges (which can flow away) and positive induced charges on the far side. Since the sphere is neutral, the total induced charges must sum to zero. So perhaps the sphere's induced charges are +q and -q? No, that can't be right because the sphere would have a net charge of zero.

Wait, maybe the sphere's induced charge is zero. When you bring a charge q near, the induced charges are +q near and -q far, but since the sphere was neutral, the net induced charge is zero. But in reality, the induced charges are not +q and -q, but maybe something else.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the image charge method. The potential energy U is the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which simplifies things.

So, the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, and the potential outside is as if all the charge were at the center. But the sphere is neutral, so the potential outside is zero as well.

Wait, that can't be right because the external charge q would create its own potential. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps considering the sphere as a capacitor. The sphere has a self-capacitance C = 4πε₀ R. But when another charge is near, the capacitance changes. But I'm not sure how to approach this.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is neutral, the induced charges are equal and opposite.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the work done to bring q near the sphere, which would be the charge times the potential at that point due to the sphere. But the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So U is zero? That doesn't seem right because the options don't include zero.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Let's think of the potential energy as the energy stored in the system due to the configuration of the charges.

The charge q is placed outside the sphere. The sphere being grounded allows for induced charges to adjust. The induced charges on the sphere would consist of -q near the charge and +q on the opposite side. But since the sphere is neutral, the total induced charge is zero. So the sphere's surface has induced charges, but the net charge is zero.

Wait, but when you place a charge q near a neutral conducting sphere, the sphere's surface develops induced charges: negative on the near side, positive on the far side. The total induced charge is zero, so the sphere remains neutral. But these induced charges are due to the external charge q. So the potential energy would be the work done in assembling these induced charges and the external charge.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy U can be thought of as the energy stored in the electric fields created by these charges. So, when you bring the charge q from infinity, you do work against the electric field produced by the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges rearrange such that their field inside the conductor is zero. So the external charge q only interacts with the induced charges outside the sphere.

Alternatively, the potential energy is the energy of the charge q in the potential created by the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere. But if the sphere is neutral, the potential outside would be zero, so the potential energy U would be zero. But that seems unlikely because the options don't have zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the method of images. Let me revisit that. When using the method of images for a grounded sphere, the image charge is located inside the sphere. And the image charge's magnitude is such that the potential due to the external charge and the image charge on the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the image charge q' inside the sphere is given by q' = - (R² / d) q. Wait, but earlier I thought that's the case, but let me think again.

The image charge is inside the sphere because the sphere is grounded. The distance from the center to the image charge is x = R² / d. So the image charge is at a distance x from the center.

So, the system effectively consists of the external charge q and the image charge q'. The potential energy of the system is the potential energy between these two charges.

Potential energy U is given by U = (1/2) * (k q q') / r, where r is the distance between the two charges.

Wait, no, the image method is a way to find the potential, but the actual energy is the energy due to the real charges and the induced ones. Alternatively, the potential energy is the sum of the energies of the real charge and the induced charges.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy can be found as the energy stored in the external charge and the image charge.

So, the potential energy U is the potential energy of the real charge q in the field of the induced charges, which can be modeled as the image charge q'.

So, the potential energy U is the work done to bring q from infinity, which would be the charge times the potential at that point due to the image charge.

Wait, but the potential at the location of q due to the image charge q' is k q' / (d - x), where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. Since x = R²/d, then d - x is d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = q * [k q' / (d - x) ].

But q' is the image charge, which is negative.

Wait, and q' is given by earlier as q' = - (R² / d) q.

So,

U = q * [ k (- R² q / d) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) ) ]

Simplify the denominator: (d² - R²)/d = [d(d) - R² ] /d.

So,

U = q * [ k (- R² q / d) * d/(d² - R²) ) ]

Simplify:

The d in the numerator and denominator cancels.

U = q * [ k (- R² q ) / (d² - R²) ) ]

Which is,

U = - (k R² q²) / (d² - R²)

Wait, but that's just the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge.

But wait, the potential energy is actually the sum of the energies of each pair. Since the image charge is inside the sphere, the real charge q and image charge q' interact, and their potential energy is U = k q q' / |d - x|.

Wait, but wait, I think the correct formula for the potential energy in the image method is (1/2) times the product of the charges times the potential each creates at the other.

So, U = (1/2) * k q q' / (d - x).

But since x = R²/d,

d - x = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k q * (- R² q / d) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify numerator:

k q * (- R² q ) / d → denominator is (d² - R²)/d → so division by that is multiplying by d/(d² - R²).

So,

U = (1/2) * [ (- R² q² k ) / d ] * [ d/(d² - R²) ) ]

The d's cancel,

U = (1/2) * [ (- R² q² k ) / (d² - R²) ) ]

Which becomes,

U = - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R²)

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to exactly match this, except option C, which is -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). Wait, no, option C is written as -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²), which matches this.

But wait, option C is:

U=-(1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 -R^2)

So, that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, let me double-check. The method of images gives this, but is there another factor I missed? Because sometimes the potential energy is considered as the energy of the system, which includes the image charge, but since the image charge is part of the induced charges on the sphere, which is neutral, maybe the potential energy is only between the real charge and the induced image charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the same as (1/2) q times the potential it creates at its own location. But the potential at q's location is due to the sphere. Wait, but since the sphere's potential is zero, the potential at q's location is due to the image charge.

Wait, no, the potential at q's location is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Using the image method, the potential at q's location is the same as if the image charge were there. So the potential at q is k q' / (d - x), which is the same as the potential due to the image charge.

So, the potential energy U is the charge q multiplied by this potential.

So,

U = q * [ k q' / (d - x) ]

Which, as before, leads to the same expression.

So, the potential energy is - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2), which is option C.

Wait, but why the factor of 1/2? Because in the image method, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of the charges. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the potential energy could be considered as just the work done in bringing the charge, which is q times the potential at that point due to all other charges, which in this case includes the image charge.

Wait, but the image charge is a model to find the potential, not a real charge. So perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing the real charge q, considering the potential due to the sphere, which is modeled by the image charge.

But according to the calculation, the potential energy is - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²), which matches option C.

Looking at the options, option C is indeed that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is neutral initially but develops induced charges on its surface due to the external charge \( q \). Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, and the induced charges redistribute to maintain this condition.

Using the method of images, the potential energy of the system can be determined by modeling the induced charges on the sphere as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the external charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by:

\[
q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q
\]

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done in bringing the charge \( q \) from infinity to its position, considering the interaction between \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is \( d - x = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \). The potential energy is then:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{d - x}
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and \( d - x = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R^2 q^2}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

This matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the system's potential energy is minimized due to the attractive interaction between the external charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the sphere.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect. The denominator \( d^2 + R^2 \) does not match the derived expression \( d^2 - R^2 \).
- **Option B:** Incorrect. The numerator \( k q^2 d \) does not match the derived expression, and the denominator \( d^2 - R^2 \) is correct but the overall form is wrong.
- **Option C:** Correct. Matches the derived expression \( U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R^2 q^2}{d^2 - R^2} \).
- **Option D:** Incorrect. The numerator \( k q^2 R \) and the denominator \( d^2 - R^2 \) do not match the derived expression.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think about what I know.

The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, right, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves interactions between charges, and since the sphere is conducting, I remember some things about how charges distribute on conductors.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. But if the sphere is neutral initially, when another charge is placed near it, how does that affect it?

I think when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the charges on the sphere redistribute. But since it's grounded, the sphere might not have any net charge; it would just have induced charges on its surface. Wait, no, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can leave or enter the sphere. So maybe the sphere's net charge remains zero? Or does the presence of the external charge induce charges on the sphere?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. For a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface. If the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can adjust because the sphere can exchange charges with the ground. So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's surface would have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere might remain zero. Or is it that the sphere can have a net charge if it's not grounded, but when grounded, it's neutral? Hmm.

Wait, no. The sphere is grounded, so if the charge q is placed near it, the sphere can have induced charges. But since it's a conductor, the induced charges will separate such that the inside of the conductor (the cavity) has no electric field. But wait, the sphere is solid, isn't it? No, wait, it's a conducting sphere, so the charge can move freely on the surface.

So when an external charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. The external charge will induce opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced opposite charges can flow into the ground, making the sphere have a net charge equal to the induced same charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sphere is neutral to start with. When you place a charge q near it, the sphere's surface will have induced charges: negative charges near q and positive charges on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the negative charges can leave the sphere through the ground, so the sphere will end up with a net positive charge equal to q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. If the external charge is positive, the sphere's near side has negative induced charges, and the far side has positive induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the negative charges can flow away, so the sphere's net charge would be positive because the positive induced charges can't leave (since the sphere is a conductor, but the ground can't provide positive charges). Wait, no, wait. The ground is at zero potential, so it can accept or provide electrons. So if the sphere has negative charges induced, they can flow into the ground (ground provides electrons, so the sphere loses negative charges). So the sphere's surface would have positive charges induced. But wait, the sum of induced charges would be zero because the sphere was neutral.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the method of images. In the method of images for a grounded sphere, the induced charges can be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the position d away from the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. Hmm, that might help.

Wait, so the potential energy U is the work done in assembling this configuration. So when you bring charge q from infinity to a distance d from the center of the sphere, you're doing work against the electric field. But the sphere being grounded complicates things because it can have induced charges which affect the potential.

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, any charges induced on it can move, but the overall potential of the sphere's surface is zero. So when you bring the charge q near, the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to both the sphere and the charge itself?

Wait, maybe another approach. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each part. But when you have two charges, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of the charges times the potential each charge creates at the location of the other.

But here, the sphere is neutral but conducting, so the charges are on the surface. So the potential at the location of q due to the sphere and vice versa.

Wait, but how to model the potential due to the sphere. For a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. Since it's grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere (which is zero) plus the potential due to q itself. Wait, no, because the sphere is a conductor, the potential outside the sphere is as if all its charge were at the center. But in this case, the sphere is neutral, so the external potential due to the sphere is zero. So the potential at the location of q is just the potential due to q itself, but since the sphere is neutral, maybe that's zero. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think of the potential energy of the system as the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so it can adjust its induced charges, which effectively means the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, maybe using the concept of capacitance. The sphere can be considered as a capacitor with the point charge. The sphere, being a conductor, can be thought of as having a self-capacitance, but when another charge is near it, the capacitance changes. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this approach.

Alternatively, think about the image method. For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge for a point charge outside the sphere is located at a distance from the center such that r' = R^2 / d, where R is the sphere's radius and d is the distance of the external charge from the center. The image charge q' is negative and has a magnitude dependent on the external charge and the distance.

Wait, right! The method of images says that a conducting sphere can be modeled by placing an image charge inside the sphere. For a grounded sphere, the image charge is inside, and its magnitude is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

So, for a point charge q located at distance d from the center of a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance d' from the center towards the charge. The image charge's magnitude is (R^2 / d) * q. Wait, no, I think the image charge is (R^2 / (d - R)) * q or something similar.

Wait, no, the formula I remember for the image charge when the sphere is non-grounded is different, but when it's grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is given by (R^2 / (d)) * q, but I'm not exactly sure about the formula. Alternatively, the image charge's distance from the center is (R^2)/d.

Wait, let me think. When the sphere is grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is such that the potential at the surface of the sphere is zero. So the potential due to q and q' at the surface should cancel. So the potential due to q is k q / R (since the sphere's radius is R), and the image charge q' is located at a distance x from the center, towards the charge q. Then the potential due to q' at the surface is k q' / (R - x). But since the sphere is grounded, the sum of these potentials is zero. So:

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance from the image charge to the surface is R - x, where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. So, the potential from the external charge and the image charge at the surface must sum to zero.

So, V_external = k q / R

V_image = k q' / (R - x)

So,

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact setup. Maybe another approach: the image charge q' for a grounded sphere is given by q' = - q (R/d)², and the distance from the center is x = R²/d.

Wait, that sounds familiar. So for a point charge q at distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge inside the sphere is q' = - (R^2 / d^2) q, located at a distance x = R^2 / d from the center, along the line connecting the center and the external charge.

Wait, let me check: If d is the distance from the external charge to the center, then the image charge is at x = R² / (d - R) ? Hmm, perhaps I should look up the image charge formula again. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I think.

So, the image charge q' is - (R² / d) q, and it's located at a distance x = R² / d from the center towards the external charge.

Wait, no, perhaps it's (R² / (d - R)) * q? Hmm, this is getting a bit fuzzy. Alternatively, I think the image charge for a grounded sphere is given by q' = - (R² / d) q, located at x = R² / d from the center. So at a point that's closer than the original charge.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential. The potential on the sphere's surface must be zero because it's grounded. The potential due to the external charge q is k q / R. The potential due to the image charge q' at the surface is k q' / (R - x), where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. So:

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

But x is the distance from the center to the image charge. So if the image charge is inside the sphere, x must be less than R. Wait, but if the external charge is at d > R, which it is, then the image charge is inside.

Wait, let me think: the image charge is inside the sphere, so x < R. So the distance from the image charge to the surface is R - x.

So:

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

But the image charge's location is x = R² / d.

Wait, if d is the distance from the external charge to the center, then the image charge is at x = R²/(d) from the center. Hmm, but if d is larger than R, then x would be smaller than R, which makes sense because the image is inside.

So, substituting x = R²/d,

k q / R + k q' / (R - (R²/d)) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (R - (R²/d)):

k q (R - (R²/d)) / R + k q' = 0.

Simplify:

k q [ (R d - R²) / (R d) ) ] + k q' = 0

Wait, perhaps a better way is to substitute x = R²/d into the previous equation.

So,

k q / R + k q' / (R - x) = 0.

x = R²/d,

So,

k q / R + k q' / (R - R²/d) = 0.

Let me compute R - R²/d: R(1 - R/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So,

k q / R + k q' * d/( R (d - R) ) )= 0.

Factor out k:

k [ q/R + q' * d/( R (d - R) ) ] = 0.

Divide both sides by k:

q/R + q' * d/( R (d - R) ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by R:

q + q' * d/(d - R) = 0.

Solve for q':

q' * d/(d - R) = - q.

q' = - q (d - R)/d.

So,

q' = - q (d - R)/d.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I messed up the image charge formula.

Wait, but another way: the image charge method for a grounded sphere. The image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, where r' = R² / d. But wait, that would be the case when the sphere is uncharged. But since it's grounded, perhaps the image charge is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of potential energy.

The potential energy U of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere, considering the potential due to the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at the point d is due to the charge q itself? But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere and due to itself. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at q's location is due to the sphere (which is zero) plus the potential due to q. So that's just zero? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is the product of the charge q and the potential at its location due to all other sources. The potential at q's location due to the sphere is zero (since the sphere's surface is at zero potential, and for a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface). So the potential at q's location is due to the sphere (zero) and q itself, but that's a bit circular.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charges. So when you bring charge q near the sphere, you have to do work against the electric field created by any induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced negative charges can flow into the ground, leaving the sphere with induced positive charges.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral. So when you bring a positive charge q near it, the sphere's near side will have negative induced charges (which can flow away) and positive induced charges on the far side. Since the sphere is neutral, the total induced charges must sum to zero. So perhaps the sphere's induced charges are +q and -q? No, that can't be right because the sphere would have a net charge of zero.

Wait, maybe the sphere's induced charge is zero. When you bring a charge q near, the induced charges are +q near and -q far, but since the sphere was neutral, the net induced charge is zero. But in reality, the induced charges are not +q and -q, but maybe something else.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the image charge method. The potential energy U is the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which simplifies things.

So, the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, and the potential outside is as if all the charge were at the center. But the sphere is neutral, so the potential outside is zero as well.

Wait, that can't be right because the external charge q would create its own potential. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps considering the sphere as a capacitor. The sphere has a self-capacitance C = 4πε₀ R. But when another charge is near, the capacitance changes. But I'm not sure how to approach this.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is neutral, the induced charges are equal and opposite.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the work done to bring q near the sphere, which would be the charge times the potential at that point due to the sphere. But the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So U is zero? That doesn't seem right because the options don't include zero.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Let's think of the potential energy as the energy stored in the system due to the configuration of the charges.

The charge q is placed outside the sphere. The sphere being grounded allows for induced charges to adjust. The induced charges on the sphere would consist of -q near the charge and +q on the opposite side. But since the sphere is neutral, the total induced charge is zero. So the sphere's surface has induced charges, but the net charge is zero.

Wait, but when you place a charge q near a neutral conducting sphere, the sphere's surface develops induced charges: negative on the near side, positive on the far side. The total induced charge is zero, so the sphere remains neutral. But these induced charges are due to the external charge q. So the potential energy would be the work done in assembling these induced charges and the external charge.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy U can be thought of as the energy stored in the electric fields created by these charges. So, when you bring the charge q from infinity, you do work against the electric field produced by the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges rearrange such that their field inside the conductor is zero. So the external charge q only interacts with the induced charges outside the sphere.

Alternatively, the potential energy is the energy of the charge q in the potential created by the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere. But if the sphere is neutral, the potential outside would be zero, so the potential energy U would be zero. But that seems unlikely because the options don't have zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the method of images. Let me revisit that. When using the method of images for a grounded sphere, the image charge is located inside the sphere. And the image charge's magnitude is such that the potential due to the external charge and the image charge on the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the image charge q' inside the sphere is given by q' = - (R² / d) q. Wait, but earlier I thought that's the case, but let me think again.

The image charge is inside the sphere because the sphere is grounded. The distance from the center to the image charge is x = R² / d. So the image charge is at a distance x from the center.

So, the system effectively consists of the external charge q and the image charge q'. The potential energy of the system is the potential energy between these two charges.

Potential energy U is given by U = (1/2) * (k q q') / r, where r is the distance between the two charges.

Wait, no, the image method is a way to find the potential, but the actual energy is the energy due to the real charges and the induced ones. Alternatively, the potential energy is the sum of the energies of the real charge and the induced charges.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy can be found as the energy stored in the external charge and the image charge.

So, the potential energy U is the potential energy of the real charge q in the field of the induced charges, which can be modeled as the image charge q'.

So, the potential energy U is the work done to bring q from infinity, which would be the charge times the potential at that point due to the image charge.

Wait, but the potential at the location of q due to the image charge q' is k q' / (d - x), where x is the distance from the center to the image charge. Since x = R²/d, then d - x is d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = q * [k q' / (d - x) ].

But q' is the image charge, which is negative.

Wait, and q' is given by earlier as q' = - (R² / d) q.

So,

U = q * [ k (- R² q / d) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) ) ]

Simplify the denominator: (d² - R²)/d = [d(d) - R² ] /d.

So,

U = q * [ k (- R² q / d) * d/(d² - R²) ) ]

Simplify:

The d in the numerator and denominator cancels.

U = q * [ k (- R² q ) / (d² - R²) ) ]

Which is,

U = - (k R² q²) / (d² - R²)

Wait, but that's just the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge.

But wait, the potential energy is actually the sum of the energies of each pair. Since the image charge is inside the sphere, the real charge q and image charge q' interact, and their potential energy is U = k q q' / |d - x|.

Wait, but wait, I think the correct formula for the potential energy in the image method is (1/2) times the product of the charges times the potential each creates at the other.

So, U = (1/2) * k q q' / (d - x).

But since x = R²/d,

d - x = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k q * (- R² q / d) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify numerator:

k q * (- R² q ) / d → denominator is (d² - R²)/d → so division by that is multiplying by d/(d² - R²).

So,

U = (1/2) * [ (- R² q² k ) / d ] * [ d/(d² - R²) ) ]

The d's cancel,

U = (1/2) * [ (- R² q² k ) / (d² - R²) ) ]

Which becomes,

U = - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R²)

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to exactly match this, except option C, which is -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). Wait, no, option C is written as -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²), which matches this.

But wait, option C is:

U=-(1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 -R^2)

So, that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, let me double-check. The method of images gives this, but is there another factor I missed? Because sometimes the potential energy is considered as the energy of the system, which includes the image charge, but since the image charge is part of the induced charges on the sphere, which is neutral, maybe the potential energy is only between the real charge and the induced image charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the same as (1/2) q times the potential it creates at its own location. But the potential at q's location is due to the sphere. Wait, but since the sphere's potential is zero, the potential at q's location is due to the image charge.

Wait, no, the potential at q's location is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Using the image method, the potential at q's location is the same as if the image charge were there. So the potential at q is k q' / (d - x), which is the same as the potential due to the image charge.

So, the potential energy U is the charge q multiplied by this potential.

So,

U = q * [ k q' / (d - x) ]

Which, as before, leads to the same expression.

So, the potential energy is - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2), which is option C.

Wait, but why the factor of 1/2? Because in the image method, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of the charges. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the potential energy could be considered as just the work done in bringing the charge, which is q times the potential at that point due to all other charges, which in this case includes the image charge.

Wait, but the image charge is a model to find the potential, not a real charge. So perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing the real charge q, considering the potential due to the sphere, which is modeled by the image charge.

But according to the calculation, the potential energy is - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²), which matches option C.

Looking at the options, option C is indeed that.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is neutral initially but develops induced charges on its surface due to the external charge \( q \). Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, and the induced charges redistribute to maintain this condition.

Using the method of images, the potential energy of the system can be determined by modeling the induced charges on the sphere as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the external charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by:

\[
q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q
\]

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done in bringing the charge \( q \) from infinity to its position, considering the interaction between \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is \( d - x = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \). The potential energy is then:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{d - x}
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and \( d - x = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R^2 q^2}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

This matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the system's potential energy is minimized due to the attractive interaction between the external charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the sphere.

**Critical analysis of options:**
