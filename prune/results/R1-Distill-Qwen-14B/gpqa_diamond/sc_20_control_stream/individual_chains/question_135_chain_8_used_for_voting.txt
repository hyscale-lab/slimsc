Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is a Yukawa-like interaction because it's similar to how fermions couple to scalar fields. So the boson X is interacting with fermions via some coupling λ.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy must be sufficient for the production of the fermions. Since X is a boson with a certain mass, its decay products must each have a mass less than X's mass. Oh, but wait, when a particle decays, each product's rest mass must be less than or equal to half the parent's mass because each product has to have some kinetic energy. Right, because in the rest frame of X, the decay products must each have energy at least their rest mass energy.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that X can decay into must have each fermion's mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait: what about particles like the top quark? The top is super heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 173 is way bigger than 3 GeV. Same for the b quark, which is about 4.7 GeV. So any fermion with mass higher than 3 GeV can't be a decay product.

So first, I'll list all the known fermions and their masses to see which are allowed.

Let me list the fermion masses (approximately):

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:

- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV (much less than 1 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons: same as above.

Wait, but in the decay, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. So for pairs like b quark, each is 4.7 GeV, which is higher than 3 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed because 4.7 > 3. So X can't decay into b bbar. Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy, so no t tbar decay.

So possible fermions are those with mass ≤ 3 GeV. Let's see:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, the masses:

c quark is ~1.5 GeV. So 1.5 is less than 3, okay.

b is 4.7>3, so no.

So possible decay products are:

e+ e- : mass ~0.0005 each, so 0.001 GeV, definitely allowed.

mu+ mu-: ~0.105 each, sum 0.21 GeV < 6 GeV, but individually each is under 3 GeV.

tau+ tau-: ~1.78 each, sum ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. Each is under 3 GeV (1.78 <3), so allowed.

u and d quarks: their masses are way under 3 GeV.

s quarks: mass 95 MeV, so way under.

c quarks: 1.5 GeV each, sum 3 GeV; each is under 3, so allowed.

So possible decay modes include c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Wait, but the question is about the interaction term. The given Lagrangian is L = -λf ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps that's a typo, because ψ_f appears twice. Maybe it's meant to be ψ_i and ψ_f, like in a Yukawa coupling. But the way it's written, perhaps it's ψ_f(y) multiplied by (ῡ + X) and another ψ_f(y). Or perhaps it's (ῡ + X) in some other context.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is something like L = λ ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, which would be a Yukawa interaction where X is a scalar coupling to the fermion ψ_f. So each fermion ψ_f couples to X. So the interaction term is between X and each fermion species.

Wait, but if it's a Yukawa coupling, then X would interact with each fermion species. But in the problem statement, the question is about the possible decay modes. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair it can couple to, provided that their combined mass is less than X's mass.

But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is probably for each species. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair it couples to, as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

So the possible decay products would be any fermion pair where each fermion's mass is ≤ 3 GeV, and X couples to them.

Now, but considering the standard model, X would have to be a boson that can interact with these fermions. So for example, the Higgs boson couples to all fermions, but in this case, perhaps X is similar. But wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So X couples to each fermion ψ_f with a coupling λ_f.

So the fermions that X can decay into are all the ones for which the interaction is present, and their masses meet the condition.

So looking back at the options, which ones include only fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.

Let me check the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is ~4.7 GeV, which is greater than 3 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So all the fermions here: c is 1.5 GeV, s is ~0.1 GeV, u and d even less; tau is 1.78 GeV, mu is 0.1, e is 0.0005. So all these have masses under 3 GeV. So this option is possible.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But wait, t is top quark, 173 GeV. So decay into t tbar is impossible as 173>3. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, the b is too heavy. So D is wrong.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the fermion masses.

c quark: around 1.27 GeV (some sources say approx 1.5, others lower). Let me confirm.

Yes, the charm quark mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 1.5 * 2 is 3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So decay into c cbar is allowed because 1.5 + 1.5 =3 GeV, but the total mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the parent particle. But wait, in reality, each fermion's rest mass must be less than or equal to half the parent's mass because in the center of mass frame, each would have energy at least equal to their rest mass, and the sum would be up to the parent's mass.

So 6 GeV parent, each fermion can be up to 3 GeV. So a fermion with mass 3 GeV can be produced, but any higher would not be allowed.

So a c quark at 1.5 GeV is fine. b is 4.7 GeV, which is too much.

So the allowed decay products are: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So which option includes these? Option B.

But let me check the options again.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, what about the tau? Tau's mass is around 1.78 GeV, so each is 1.78, which is less than 3 GeV. So allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the given Lagrangian, which implies that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair it couples to, provided the fermion masses are less than or equal to half the mass of \( X \) (i.e., \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraint**: For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the rest mass of each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total energy of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( u \): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - \( b \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 4.7 > 3 \))
   - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 173 > 3 \))

3. **Decay Modes**:
   - \( X \to b \bar{b} \): Not allowed, as \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to t \bar{t} \): Not allowed, as \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to c \bar{c} \): Allowed, as \( m_c \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to s \bar{s} \): Allowed, as \( m_s \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to u \bar{u} \): Allowed, as \( m_u \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to d \bar{d} \): Allowed, as \( m_d \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \): Allowed, as \( m_\tau \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \): Allowed, as \( m_\mu \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( X \to e^+ e^- \): Allowed, as \( m_e \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay modes of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
