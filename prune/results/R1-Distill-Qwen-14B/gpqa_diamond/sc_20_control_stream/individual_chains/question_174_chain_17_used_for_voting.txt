Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and relativistic vs. classical kinetic energy. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Interesting.

Wait, the initial rest mass is M, and after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M? So that means some mass has been converted into kinetic energy and perhaps other forms of energy. But since the problem says nothing else is produced, I guess the rest mass of the two fragments together is 0.99 M.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic calculations) and the classical approximation. Options are in the range of MeV, so the difference is small—maybe relativistic effects are minor here, but let's see.

First, let's get the masses of the two fragments. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the heavier is 2m. So together, their rest mass is m + 2m = 3m. According to the problem, 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M) /3 = 0.33 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3m is 0.99 M, so m is (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M? No, wait, because 3m is 0.99 M, so m is 0.33 M? Wait, 0.99 divided by 3 is 0.33? Wait, 0.99 /3 is 0.33 exactly? Hmm, 0.33*3 is 0.99, yes. So m = 0.33 M, and the heavier fragment is 0.66 M.

Wait, but initial mass was M, and the sum is 0.99 M. So sum is less than initial, which makes sense because some mass is converted into kinetic energy.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 (heavier fragment) and v2 (lighter). Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2. But because m1 is 2m (since m1 = 2m and m2 = m?), wait wait, wait. Wait, wait, I think I got that wrong. Wait, the fragments are m and 2m, so the heavier is 2m and lighter is m. So m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So momentum: (2m) v1 = m v2. So 2 v1 = v2. Oh, right, because the masses are 2m and m, so the momentum equation is 2m v1 = m v2 → 2v1 = v2.

Now, considering energy. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy, which is M c² = 300 GeV. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, its total energy is its rest energy.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies.

So, initial energy: M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission:

Energy = (2m c² + m c²) + (T1 + T2) 

But wait, the rest mass energies sum to 3m c² = 0.99 M c². Because 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M.

So 3m c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So initial energy is 300 GeV, and after, the rest masses contribute 297 GeV, so remaining energy is 3 GeV, which must be the total kinetic energy of the two fragments. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Now, from momentum, we have 2 v1 = v2. So if we can express v1 and v2, and then compute their kinetic energies, we can find T1.

But wait, kinetic energy depends on the velocity, and in relativistic terms, that's a bit more involved than classical mechanics.

The problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So perhaps we can compute T1 both ways and take the difference.

So let's proceed. First, I'll consider the classical (non-relativistic) case, then the relativistic case.

But in the relativistic case, since velocities are probably not negligible (given that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is small compared to 300 GeV, but let's see), we need to account for relativistic effects.

But perhaps, to check, let's compute the velocities in the classical approach first.

In the classical model, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So let's compute the velocities.

From momentum: 2m v1 = m v2 → 2v1 = v2.

So v2 = 2 v1.

The two kinetic energies are T1 = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

T2 = (1/2) m v2² = (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So T1 + T2 = m v1² + 2 m v1² = 3 m v1² = 3 GeV.

So 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

Since m is 0.33 M, and M is 300 GeV/c² → m = (0.33)(300 GeV/c²) = 99 GeV/c².

So m v1² = 99 GeV/c² * v1² = 1 GeV.

So v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) = c² / 99 → v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c /9.95 ≈ 0.1 c.

So v1 ≈ 0.1 c.

Now, the kinetic energy in classical terms is T1 = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1² = (99 GeV/c²) (c² /99) ) = 1 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. So in the classical approximation, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, the sum of T1 and T2 is 3 GeV, which aligns. Because T2 would be 2 GeV in the classical case.

But wait, in reality, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2) m v². So let's compute the relativistic T1.

In the relativistic case, the energy of each fragment is gamma m c². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So let's find the velocities of the two fragments.

We know that the total momentum is zero, so their momenta are equal and opposite.

The relativistic momentum for each fragment is gamma m v.

So for the heavy fragment (mass 2m), the momentum p1 = gamma1 * 2m * v1.

For the light fragment (mass m), p2 = gamma2 * m * v2.

And since the system is at rest before, p1 = -p2 → gamma1 * 2m v1 = gamma2 * m v2.

So 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But from before, in the classical case, v2 = 2 v1.

But relativistically, velocities don't add that way. Hmm, but perhaps we can find a relationship between v1 and v2.

Wait, but from the momentum equation, we have 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But since I don't know v2 in terms of v1, I need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy conservation. The total energy after fission is 300 GeV (initial) = sum of rest energies plus kinetic.

Which is:

(2m c² + m c²) + T1 + T2 = 300 GeV.

Wait, but 2m c² + m c² = 3 m c² = 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV.

So 297 GeV + (T1 + T2) = 300 GeV → T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

So same as before.

But in the relativistic case, T1 and T2 are (gamma1 -1) 2m c² and (gamma2 -1) m c².

Wait, no. Wait, each kinetic energy is (gamma -1) times rest mass energy.

So for fragment 1 (mass 2m), T1 = (gamma1 -1) (2m c²).

Fragment 2 (mass m), T2 = (gamma2 -1) (m c²).

So T1 + T2 = (gamma1 -1)(2m c²) + (gamma2 -1)(m c²) =3 GeV.

We also have the momentum equation: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

And from velocity, perhaps the relation between v1 and v2 is not as simple as the classical case.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can assume that the heavier fragment has a lower speed, so that gamma1 is small. But perhaps an alternative approach is better.

Let me consider that the two fragments move in opposite directions with velocities v and u, respectively.

Then, from momentum conservation:

(2m) v = m u → 2v = u.

From energy conservation:

(2m gamma1 c²) + (m gamma2 c²) = 300 GeV.

But 2m gamma1 + m gamma2 = 300 GeV / c².

Wait, but 300 GeV is M c², since M is the initial mass.

But M c² = 300 GeV.

So, 2m gamma1 + m gamma2 = M.

Since 3m =0.99 M → m = 0.33 M.

So substituting m, we have:

2*(0.33 M) gamma1 + (0.33 M) gamma2 = M.

Divide both sides by M:

2*(0.33) gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

Which simplifies to:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

We also have from momentum: 2v = u.

But in terms of gamma, v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²) and same for u.

Hmm, this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write equations in terms of gamma1 and gamma2, using the momentum and energy conservation.

We have two equations:

1) 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2. (momentum)

2) 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = (M c² + T1 + T2) / (m c²) → Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, I think I confused the variables. Let's think again.

Energy equation: (2m gamma1 c²) + (m gamma2 c²) = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by c²:

2m gamma1 + m gamma2 = 300 GeV / c².

But M c² = 300 GeV → M = 300 GeV / c².

So 2m gamma1 + m gamma2 = M.

And since m = (0.99 M) /3, let's substitute that.

So m = (0.99 M)/3 → 0.33 M.

So substituting m into energy equation:

2*(0.33 M) gamma1 + (0.33 M) gamma2 = M.

Divide both sides by M:

2*(0.33) gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

Which is 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

So equation (A): 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

Equation (B): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But v1 = c sqrt(1 -1/gamma1² ), and v2 = c sqrt(1 -1/gamma2² ).

So equation (B): 2 gamma1 * c * sqrt(1-1/gamma1²) ) = gamma2 * c * sqrt(1-1/gamma2² )

We can cancel c from both sides:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1² ) = gamma2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma2² )

Let me square both sides to eliminate square roots:

[2 gamma1]^2 (1 -1/gamma1² ) = [gamma2]^2 (1 -1/gamma2² )

So 4 gamma1² (1 -1/gamma1² ) = gamma2² (1 -1/gamma2² )

Simplify the left side:

4 gamma1² ( (gamma1² -1)/gamma1² ) ) =4 (gamma1² -1 )

Similarly, right side: gamma2² ( (gamma2² -1)/gamma2² ) ) = gamma2² -1.

So equation becomes:

4 (gamma1² -1) = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3.

So now, we have two equations:

Equation (A): 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

Equation (C):4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3.

Hmm, solving these two equations for gamma1 and gamma2. Seems tricky, but perhaps we can express gamma2 from (A) and substitute into (C).

From (A): 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1 → divide both sides by 0.33:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 1/0.33 → 1/0.33 ≈3.0303.

So, gamma2 =3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Now, substitute into equation (C):

4 gamma1² - (3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )^2 =3.

Expand the square:

(3.0303)^2 = approx (3.03)^2 → let's calculate:

3.03^2 = (3 +0.03)^2= 9 + 2*3*0.03 +0.03²=9 +0.18 +0.0009=9.1809.

So,

4 gamma1² - [9.1809 - 2*3.03 *2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2 ] =3.

Wait, wait, no. Wait (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So (3.03 -2 gamma1)^2 is (3.03)^2 - 2*(3.03)*(2 gamma1) + (2 gamma1)^2.

So:

4 gamma1² - [ 9.1809 - 12.12 gamma1 +4 gamma1² ] =3.

Distribute the negative sign:

4 gamma1² -9.1809 +12.12 gamma1 -4 gamma1² =3.

The 4 gamma1² and -4 gamma1² cancel.

So:

-9.1809 +12.12 gamma1 =3 → 12.12 gamma1 = 3 +9.1809 = 12.1809.

So gamma1 = 12.1809 /12.12 ≈ 1.005.

Wait, that's approximately 1.005. Hmm, that's very close to 1, which would imply that the velocity is low, and relativistic effects are minimal. That suggests that the classical approximation is a good one here.

So gamma1 ≈1.005.

Then, from equation (A): 0.66 *1.005 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

Calculate 0.66 *1.005 → approx 0.6633.

So 0.6633 +0.33 gamma2 =1 → 0.33 gamma2 =0.3367 → gamma2 ≈ 1.0205.

So gamma1 is about 1.005, gamma2 about 1.0205.

Now, compute T1 and T2.

Relativistic KE is (gamma -1) m c².

For fragment 1 (2m):

T1 = (gamma1 -1) * 2m c².

Similarly, fragment 2:

T2 = (gamma2 -1) * m c².

We know that T1 + T2=3 GeV.

But let's compute each:

gamma1 ≈1.005 → gamma1-1=0.005.

gamma2≈1.0205 → gamma2-1=0.0205.

So T1 = 0.005 * 2m c².

m is 0.33 M, M c²=300 GeV.

So 2m c² = 2 *0.33 *300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So T1=0.005 *198 GeV=0.99 GeV.

Similarly, T2=0.0205 * m c².

m c²=0.33*300=99 GeV.

So T2=0.0205 *99 ≈2.03 GeV.

Wait, but the sum is 0.99 + 2.03 =3.02 GeV, which is close to 3 GeV. The discrepancy is due to my approximations. But I think it's close enough.

So in reality, T1 is approximately 0.99 GeV. In the classical approximation, we got T1=1 GeV.

So the correct T1 is about 0.99 GeV, and the classical estimate is 1 GeV. So the difference is about 0.01 GeV → which is 10 MeV.

Wait, 0.01 GeV is 10 MeV. So the correct T1 is lower than the classical value by about 10 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is a bit different. Let me recompute.

Wait, gamma1 is approximately 1.005, so 0.005. So T1 = (0.005) *2m c².

2m c² is 2 *0.33*300=198 GeV. So 198 * 0.005=0.99 GeV.

In the classical approximation, T1 was 1 GeV. So the correct value is 0.99 GeV, which is less than the classical by about 0.01 GeV, which is 10 MeV.

So the difference is about 10 MeV. So the correct T1 is about 10 MeV less than the classical value. So the difference is 10 MeV.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 2 MeV.

B)5 MeV.

C)10 MeV.

D)20 MeV.

So the correct option is C)10 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process and compare the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the heavier fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - The nucleus has rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments:  
     - Fragment 1 (heavier): mass \( 2m \).  
     - Fragment 2 (lighter): mass \( m \).  
   - The total rest mass of the two fragments is \( 0.99M \), meaning \( 3m = 0.99M \), so \( m = 0.33M \).  
   - The heavier fragment has mass \( 2m = 0.66M \), and the lighter fragment has mass \( m = 0.33M \).

2. **Energy Conservation**:  
   - The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the nucleus: \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies:  
     \[
     (2m c^2 + m c^2) + (T_1 + T_2) = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]  
     Substituting \( 3m = 0.99M \), the rest-mass energy of the fragments is \( 0.99M c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is:  
     \[
     T_1 + T_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

3. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   - Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. This implies:  
     \[
     2m v_1 = m v_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2v_1 = v_2.
     \]

### Classical Approximation:
In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Using the momentum relationship \( 2v_1 = v_2 \), the kinetic energies are:  
\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2}(2m)v_1^2 = m v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2}m v_2^2 = 2m v_1^2.
\]  
Thus,  
\[
T_1 + T_2 = m v_1^2 + 2m v_1^2 = 3m v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]  
Solving for \( v_1^2 \):  
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{3 \, \text{GeV}}{3m}.
\]  
Substituting \( m = 0.33M \) and \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), the classical kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:  
\[
T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Calculation:
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is \( \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The kinetic energy is \( T = (\gamma - 1)m c^2 \). Using momentum and energy conservation, the relativistic velocities and energies are computed. The heavier fragment's relativistic kinetic energy is slightly less than the classical value due to relativistic effects. After detailed calculations, the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is approximately:  
\[
T_1^{\text{relativistic}} \approx 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values:
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies is:  
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{classical}} - T_1^{\text{relativistic}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The difference between the classical and relativistic kinetic energies of the heavier fragment is **10 MeV**.
