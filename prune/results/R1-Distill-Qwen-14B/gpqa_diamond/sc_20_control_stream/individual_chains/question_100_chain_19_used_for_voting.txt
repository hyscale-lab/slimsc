Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's break it down step by step.

The question starts with compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is either propene or propyne. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and propyne is HC≡CCH3. Both have the same molecular formula. But considering the reactions, I think it's more likely propene because the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh wait, bromination of alkenes is usually via addition, while for alkynes it's substitution? Or maybe it's about the position.

So, compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. Usually, that's a bromination of an alkene via an addition reaction. So if A is propene, bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. But wait, in CCl4, which is a solvent, bromination of propene would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe it's a different position. Alternatively, maybe it's a radical bromination, but that's more for alkanes. Wait, propene is an alkene, so bromination in CCl4 is likely addition, not substitution. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or perhaps 1-bromopropane? Wait no, because propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is CH2BrCH2BrCH3?

Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 in CCl4 (a non-polar solvent, which is for addition across double bonds) would produce 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Propene has three carbons, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, when you add Br2 to propene, which is CH2=CHCH3, the bromine adds across the double bond, so the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile. So this reaction is probably an elimination reaction. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating it with alcoholic KOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an alkene. Wait, but which position? If we eliminate from C1 and C2, we'd get back propene. But wait, 1,2-dibromopropane treated with KOH would eliminate HBr from adjacent carbons, so we form a double bond. So the product C would be CH2=CHCH3 again, which is propene. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's a different product. Alternatively, could it be something else? Wait, what if elimination occurs in such a way that the double bond is between C2 and C3? No, because the Brs are on C1 and C2. So elimination would form between C1 and C2, giving propene, which is the same as A. But that would mean C is propene again.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH would actually form an epoxide? No, I think epoxidation is done with peracids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, right? So maybe it forms propene. So C is CH2=CHCH3.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Red-hot iron is usually a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for some kind of elimination. Wait, but C is propene. If you pass propene through a red-hot iron, that's usually for dehydrogenation. Iron in the presence of propene might cause dehydrogenation, forming something else. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed over hot iron can undergo dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH3) and water. Let me think: when an alkene is passed over a catalyst like iron, it can lose H2 and form an alkyne. So D would be propyne, HC≡CCH3.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, what's a mixture of two strong acids? Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3, which is a common mixture for some reactions. Or perhaps it's concentrated H2SO4 and something else. Wait, when an alkyne reacts with concentrated H2SO4, it can form a sulfonic acid, but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, if it's a mixture of H2SO4 and HgSO4, maybe it's for the oxymercuration or some hydration. Wait, no. Alternatively, treating an alkyne with a strong acid could lead to some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is undergoing some hydration. Let me think: propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with strong acids. Wait, maybe it's a hydrohalic acid, but the question says a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the alkyne is being treated with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, which is used in the production of nitro compounds. Or perhaps it's a sulfonation followed by something else. Alternatively, could it be forming a ketone via some acid-catalyzed hydration? Because treating an alkyne with H2SO4 and HgSO4 typically leads to the acid-catalyzed hydration to form a ketone. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then hydration would form propanone (acetone), which is (CH3)2CO. So E would be acetone.

Wait, but the mixture is two strong acids. Hmm. Alternatively, another possibility is that D is reacted with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps leading to a nitration reaction. But propyne is an alkyne; nitration typically occurs on aromatic rings. So if D is an alkyne, maybe it's not reacting with nitric acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids. Another thought: concentrated H2SO4 can act as a dehydrating agent. But propyne is already dehydrated. Maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, could it be that D is undergoing some kind of oxidation? Wait, but propyne is an alkyne, so maybe under certain conditions, it could oxidize to a diketone? Or maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a ketone via hydration. So back to E being acetone.

Next, compound E, which is acetone, reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Wait, iron scrap and HCl... that's probably a reducing condition. Acetone (propan-2-one) reacting with HCl and Fe. Oh, wait, that might be the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but sometimes Fe and HCl might be used in a similar context. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So acetone would be reduced to propane. So F would be propane, CH3CH2CH3.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Propane reacting with nitrous acid? Wait, nitrous acid typically reacts with amines or alcohols, but alkanes? Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.

Wait, if E is acetone, and F is propane, then F is CH3CH2CH3. Reacting with nitrous acid, which is typically used in the HNO2 reactions for diazotization of amines. But alkanes don't react with HNO2. So maybe I'm wrong in the prior steps. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps when D is reacted with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Let me think: perhaps D (propyne) undergoes some kind of addition. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with concentrated sulfuric acid could lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration would turn the alkyne into a ketone. So E would be acetone (propan-2-one). Then, F is the product of acetone reacting with Fe and HCl. That's definitely the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3). But then, F is propane, which is an alkane. Reacting with nitrous acid (which is an acid but not typically reactive with alkanes). Hmm.

Wait, maybe another approach. What if D is propyne, and reacting with a mixture of strong acids leads to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O2? Or maybe H2SO4 and another acid like HNO3. Alternatively, perhaps it's treating the alkyne with concentrated H2SO4 and heat, which might cause an acid-catalyzed hydration. So that would produce acetone.

But then, moving forward: F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid is HNO2. Wait, under certain conditions, alkanes can react with HNO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps HNO2 is used in the presence of a catalyst. Wait, perhaps F is propane, and nitrous acid is used in the presence of a catalyst to form something else. Wait, no, alkanes are generally unreactive unless under very high-energy conditions. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of E (acetone) with Fe and HCl isn't Clemmensen. Maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let me think about when propyne is treated with a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm. Wait, another thought: perhaps D (propyne) undergoes a reaction with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) to form a nitro compound. But I can't see how that would happen unless the alkyne is first converted into an aromatic ring, which doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and the reaction is a different kind of addition. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and HCl could form a chlorinated compound. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of propyne to form acetone. Let's go back to that.

So E is acetone. Then, F is the product of acetone with Fe and HCl. As I thought, Clemmensen gives propane. So F is propane. Then, when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid, what happens? Well, propane is an alkane and typically unreactive, so maybe G is the same as F? That doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps I made an error earlier.

Wait, maybe I messed up the earlier steps. Let me try to reevaluate.

Wait, initial step: A is C3H6, which is propene or propyne. Then it undergoes bromination in CCl4. For propene, bromination would be addition to form 1,2-dibromopropane. For propyne, bromination (if it's substitution) would form 1-bromo-propyne. But wait, in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, addition is likely for alkenes. So for propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it's an elimination reaction. So, elimination of two HBr molecules. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH: perhaps it's a double elimination, so we lose two HBr molecules, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is BrCH2CH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when this reacts with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr. So each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination could form either a double bond again, but wait, after elimination, it's back to propene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a different structure if elimination occurs differently.

Wait, another possibility: 1,2-dibromopropane could undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form propadiene (allene), but that's less likely. Because propadiene is less stable than propene. So perhaps it's more likely to form propene again. So C is propene.

Then, when C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it would undergo dehydrogenation to form propyne. So D is propyne, which is HC≡CCH3.

Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Let's think: propyne (HC≡CCH3) + strong acids. If the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O2, perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but H2O2 is not a strong acid. Alternatively, H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's a sulfonation followed by nitration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone. So E is acetone.

So E is acetone. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. As I thought, this is Clemmensen reduction, so F is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Hmm. Wait, I recall that nitrous acid can be used in the presence of a catalyst for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes, but F is propane, an alkane. So perhaps this step is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's think: F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid is not likely to do anything, so G would be the same as F, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's an error in the prior steps.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe E isn't acetone. Let me reevaluate D. D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids to form E. Could D be reacting via a different mechanism? For example, perhaps it's a halogenation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. But propyne is an alkyne, which can undergo hydrohalogenation. So adding HCl (a strong acid) to propyne would yield 1-chloropropane? Or 2-chloropropane? Wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. Adding HCl across the triple bond would give CH2Cl-C≡CCH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when HCl adds to an alkyne, it's typically in a two-step addition, giving a dihalide. So propyne with HCl would add twice, giving CH2Cl-C≡CCH2Cl? Wait, but that's a dihalide, which is less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are used in hydration of alkynes to form ketones. So E would be acetone. Then, F would be propane again.

Hmm. So going back, F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps the reaction to form G is incorrect, but the problem says 'which statement is incorrect', so perhaps one of the options is incorrect.

Now, moving on to the next step: G is the product of F (propane) reacting with nitrous acid. Since that doesn't make much sense, perhaps I made a mistake in prior steps. Alternatively, maybe E isn't acetone. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it undergoes a different reaction. Maybe it's a nitration reaction, but as I thought earlier, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and the reaction is some kind of oxidation. Propyne is HC≡CCH3. Oxidation of propyne would form propanoic acid (CH2(COOH)CH3)? Or maybe CO2 and H2O? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone, which is acetone.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and another acid, but I can't think of another option. So perhaps E is indeed acetone.

So F would be propane, which reacts with nitrous acid to give G. Since that doesn't make sense, perhaps the nitrous acid is reacting under different conditions. Wait, maybe F is not propane but something else. Let me check the reaction again.

Wait, E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, so F is propane. But then, how does propane react with nitrous acid? Hmm. Maybe the question is incorrect here, but the options are about which statement is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: let's list out all the compounds and their structures.

A: C3H6. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) or propyne (HC≡CCH3).

B: product of bromination of A in CCl4. For propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). For propyne, substitution would give 1-bromo-propyne (BrC≡CCH3), but since CCl4 is a solvent for addition, propene is more likely, so B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Elimination of HBr, so C is propene again (CH2=CHCH3).

D: C (propene) passed through hot iron. Dehydrogenation to propyne (HC≡CCH3).

E: D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids. Let's think: maybe concentrated H2SO4 and H2O. Under certain conditions, H2SO4 can cause hydration of alkynes to ketones. So E is acetone (CH3COCH3).

F: E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Clemmensen reduction gives propane (CH3CH2CH3).

G: F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Since alkanes don't react with HNO2, G remains propane. Hmm, but then the next step is when G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Wait, H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. If G is propane, then reacting with NaOH under what conditions? Propane doesn't react with NaOH. So something's wrong here.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the step where F is formed. Let me think again.

If E is something else, perhaps F is different. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps E is not acetone. What if D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids to form something else. Maybe it's undergoing a substitution reaction. Oh, wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. If it reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it undergoes some sulfonation or nitration. But alkyne sulfonation is possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but propyne is a terminal alkyne, so maybe it can undergo substitution.

Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) in the presence of H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's a nitration. But where? The terminal carbon is highly susceptible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone, which is acetone.

But then, moving back to F: acetone with Fe and HCl gives propane. Then, F is propane, which reacts with HNO2 to form G (propane, same as F), then G (propane) reacts with NaOH to form H (still same, as propane doesn't react with NaOH).

This suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe A is propyne, not propene. Let me try that.

If A is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then bromination in CCl4 would be substitution, since alkynes can undergo bromination via radical substitution. So B would be 1-bromo-propyne (BrC≡CCH3).

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base. So what happens when 1-bromo-propyne reacts with alcoholic KOH? It could undergo elimination. Wait, but 1-bromo-propyne is CH2Br-C≡CH? No, wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3, so 1-bromo is BrC≡CCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, perhaps elimination occurs. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but for alkynes. Wait, in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the alkyne would eliminate HBr. But in this case, the Br is on the terminal carbon. So elimination would form an alkyne with a triple bond and a double bond? Hmm, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is removed, leading to a new alkyne. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of 1-bromo-propyne with alcoholic KOH leads to the formation of propyne again. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by OH, but that would form an alkyne alcohol, which is less likely under these conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination, but I'm not certain. If the Br is on the terminal carbon, elimination could form an alkyne with a double bond? That might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each option and see which one is incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

Let's evaluate each option.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. C is the product after B reacts with alcoholic KOH. As we thought earlier, C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So D's statement is correct.

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). The structure is HC≡C-CH3. The protons on the CH3 group are all equivalent and would show up as a singlet. The proton on the HC≡C is a terminal alkyne proton, which would also be a singlet. Wait, but in NMR, the terminal alkyne proton is typically a singlet, and the methyl group is a singlet. So two singlets in the 1H NMR. So option C is correct.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, which turn yellow. So if H is a phenol, then B is correct. But in our reaction sequence, where would a phenol come from? Looking back, I don't see any steps that introduce an aromatic ring or a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring.

Wait, in the reaction steps, H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. If G is propane, then H is same as G, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in prior steps. Alternatively, perhaps H is something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reactions. Let me try to see.

Wait, perhaps E is not acetone. Let's think again.

D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids. Suppose the two acids are H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are used in hydration. So E is acetone. Then F is propane via Clemmensen. Then F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. Maybe this is a typo, and the reaction is with HNO3 instead, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps F is reacting with nitrous acid under different conditions. Wait, another thought: maybe F is propane, and G is propane. Then, when G reacts with NaOH, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is under high pressure or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the step where E is formed is incorrect. Let me think about D again.

If D is propyne, and it's treated with H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone, acetone. Then, F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of F with nitrous acid is forming an amine? But no, propane doesn't have any functional groups for that.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is propane. Propane is an alkane, which is a gas, but I don't think it's used in dye synthesis. Dyes are usually made from aromatic compounds or conjugated systems. So if F is propane, then option A is incorrect. But perhaps I'm wrong about F.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe F is something else. Let me think.

If E is not acetone, perhaps D reacts with the two acids to form something else. For example, if D is propyne, and it undergoes some kind of addition with the two acids, perhaps forming a diacid or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and they cause some kind of nitration on the alkyne, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alkynes can undergo nitration to form nitroalkynes, but I'm not certain about the conditions.

Wait, if E is nitropropyne, then F would be something else. Let's say E is nitropropyne (maybe HC≡CCH2NO2). Then, F is the product of E with Fe and HCl. But I don't know what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, and E is propanoic acid. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and H2O could undergo hydrolysis to form propargyl alcohol (CH2CH2CH3OH?), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone.

I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the options again.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. So H must be a phenol. How would H be a phenol?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me think: when D is propyne, and reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If E is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), then F would be propane via reduction. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids could be H2SO4 and another acid that acts as an oxidizing agent. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could oxidize to form propanoic acid. So E is propanoic acid.

Then, F is the product of E (propanoic acid) with Fe and HCl. But Fe and HCl are typically for reductions. Oh, wait, maybe it's a decarboxylation. Propanoic acid with Fe and HCl could lose CO2, forming propane. So F would be propane again.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. Then G is propane. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. But if G is propane, which doesn't react with NaOH, then H would be the same as G, which is propane. So option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. But H is propane, which doesn't have a phenolic group. So option B is incorrect. But wait, where would H be a phenol? There's no step in the sequence that introduces a phenolic group. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction steps. Let's see.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the two strong acids (when D is reacted) are H2SO4 and H2O, causing the alkyne to undergo oxidation. Propyne could oxidize to propanoic acid. Then E is propanoic acid. Then, F would be propane via decarboxylation with Fe and HCl. Then G is propane, which doesn't react with HNO2. So G is propane. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Propane doesn't react with NaOH, so H is same as G.

So option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. That would mean H is a phenol. But in our case, H is propane, which doesn't react with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a step where a phenol is formed. Let's think: in any of the steps, could an aromatic ring be formed?

Wait, when D (propyne) is reacted with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of cyclization. But I can't think of a way for propyne to form a benzene ring under those conditions. So no, H wouldn't be a phenol.

So, the incorrect statement is either option B or A.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is propane. Propane isn't used in dye synthesis. Dyes are typically made from aromatic compounds or conjugated systems. So option A is incorrect.

Wait, but if F is something else, like maybe butadiene or another compound, but in our case, F is propane. So option A is incorrect.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So option D is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets. D is propyne. The structure is HC≡CCH3. The H on the triple bond is one proton, a singlet. The CH3 group has three equivalent protons, another singlet. So two singlets, so option C is correct.

So, the incorrect statements are options A and B.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

If F is propane, then option A is incorrect because propane isn't used for dye synthesis. Option B is incorrect if H is propane, which doesn't react with FeCl3.

But the question is to choose the incorrect statement. So, both A and B could be incorrect, but the options are four, and only one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction steps. Let me think: maybe E is something else. If E is propanoic acid, then F is propane. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in the reaction where E is formed, it's a different product. Let me think about E again.

If D is propyne, and it's treated with H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps it's a hydration to form propargyl alcohol? No, wait, propargyl alcohol is CH2CH2CH2OH, which I don't think is relevant here.

Another possibility: perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the alkyne. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) with HCl would add HCl across the triple bond. So first addition would give CH2Cl-C≡CCH3. Then, a second addition would give CH2Cl-CH2Cl-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a dihalide. Then, F would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and another acid, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude based on the options.

Option A: F is propane. Propane isn't used in dye synthesis. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: H is propane, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so B is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is to choose one incorrect statement. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, because H is propane and doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in prior steps, and H is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the step where E is formed, it's a different product. Let me think: If D (propyne) is treated with a mixture of strong acids like H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of nitration. But without an aromatic ring, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is propionaldehyde, which upon reduction with Fe and HCl would form propane. Then F is propane.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is a different compound. But without more information, I'm stuck.

Given that, I'll proceed to the conclusion.

The options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect. Propane isn't used for dye synthesis.

B) H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. If H is propane, this is incorrect.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propyne, which gives two singlets, so this is correct.

D) C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is flammable, so correct.

The question is to find the incorrect statement. So either A or B is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the reaction where F is formed, F is not propane but something else. Let me think: if E is propanoic acid, and F is propane, then F is propane. But perhaps another possibility: if E is something else, like a nitro compound.

But without knowing, I'll have to choose between A and B.

Another approach: looking at the options, which one is definitely incorrect regardless of the steps.

If H is not a phenol, then option B is incorrect. Because the ferric chloride test is for phenols.

In our reaction sequence, there's no step that introduces a phenolic group. So H cannot be a phenol, making option B incorrect.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is option B.

The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃) as compound B. When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a double elimination occurs, regenerating propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as compound C. 

Passing propene (C) through a red-hot iron tube results in dehydrogenation, forming propyne (HC≡CCH₃) as compound D. When D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and H₂O), it undergoes hydration to form acetone (CH₃COCH₃) as compound E. Acetone (E) is then reduced by Fe and HCl (Clemmensen reduction) to form propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) as compound F. 

Propane (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but alkanes like propane do not typically react with nitrous acid, so compound G remains propane. When G reacts with NaOH, it still remains propane, as alkanes do not react with NaOH. Thus, compound H is also propane.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: "F is used for the synthesis of dyes."  
   F is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃), which is not used in dye synthesis. This statement is **incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution."  
   Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to give a yellow color. However, H is propane, which does not contain a phenolic group and does not react with ferric chloride. This statement is **incorrect**.

3. **Option C**: "D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra."  
   D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃). The terminal alkyne proton (HC≡C-) and the methyl group (CH₃) each produce a singlet in the ¹H NMR spectrum. This statement is **correct**.

4. **Option D**: "C is a flammable gas."  
   C is propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), which is a flammable gas. This statement is **correct**.

### Conclusion:
Both options A and B are incorrect. However, since the question asks for a single incorrect statement, the most definitive choice is **Option B**, as H (propane) cannot react with ferric chloride to give a yellow color.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's break it down step by step.

The question starts with compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is either propene or propyne. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and propyne is HC≡CCH3. Both have the same molecular formula. But considering the reactions, I think it's more likely propene because the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh wait, bromination of alkenes is usually via addition, while for alkynes it's substitution? Or maybe it's about the position.

So, compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. Usually, that's a bromination of an alkene via an addition reaction. So if A is propene, bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. But wait, in CCl4, which is a solvent, bromination of propene would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe it's a different position. Alternatively, maybe it's a radical bromination, but that's more for alkanes. Wait, propene is an alkene, so bromination in CCl4 is likely addition, not substitution. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or perhaps 1-bromopropane? Wait no, because propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is CH2BrCH2BrCH3?

Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 in CCl4 (a non-polar solvent, which is for addition across double bonds) would produce 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Propene has three carbons, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, when you add Br2 to propene, which is CH2=CHCH3, the bromine adds across the double bond, so the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile. So this reaction is probably an elimination reaction. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating it with alcoholic KOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an alkene. Wait, but which position? If we eliminate from C1 and C2, we'd get back propene. But wait, 1,2-dibromopropane treated with KOH would eliminate HBr from adjacent carbons, so we form a double bond. So the product C would be CH2=CHCH3 again, which is propene. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's a different product. Alternatively, could it be something else? Wait, what if elimination occurs in such a way that the double bond is between C2 and C3? No, because the Brs are on C1 and C2. So elimination would form between C1 and C2, giving propene, which is the same as A. But that would mean C is propene again.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the reaction of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH would actually form an epoxide? No, I think epoxidation is done with peracids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, right? So maybe it forms propene. So C is CH2=CHCH3.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Red-hot iron is usually a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for some kind of elimination. Wait, but C is propene. If you pass propene through a red-hot iron, that's usually for dehydrogenation. Iron in the presence of propene might cause dehydrogenation, forming something else. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed over hot iron can undergo dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH3) and water. Let me think: when an alkene is passed over a catalyst like iron, it can lose H2 and form an alkyne. So D would be propyne, HC≡CCH3.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, what's a mixture of two strong acids? Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3, which is a common mixture for some reactions. Or perhaps it's concentrated H2SO4 and something else. Wait, when an alkyne reacts with concentrated H2SO4, it can form a sulfonic acid, but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, if it's a mixture of H2SO4 and HgSO4, maybe it's for the oxymercuration or some hydration. Wait, no. Alternatively, treating an alkyne with a strong acid could lead to some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is undergoing some hydration. Let me think: propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with strong acids. Wait, maybe it's a hydrohalic acid, but the question says a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the alkyne is being treated with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, which is used in the production of nitro compounds. Or perhaps it's a sulfonation followed by something else. Alternatively, could it be forming a ketone via some acid-catalyzed hydration? Because treating an alkyne with H2SO4 and HgSO4 typically leads to the acid-catalyzed hydration to form a ketone. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then hydration would form propanone (acetone), which is (CH3)2CO. So E would be acetone.

Wait, but the mixture is two strong acids. Hmm. Alternatively, another possibility is that D is reacted with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps leading to a nitration reaction. But propyne is an alkyne; nitration typically occurs on aromatic rings. So if D is an alkyne, maybe it's not reacting with nitric acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids. Another thought: concentrated H2SO4 can act as a dehydrating agent. But propyne is already dehydrated. Maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, could it be that D is undergoing some kind of oxidation? Wait, but propyne is an alkyne, so maybe under certain conditions, it could oxidize to a diketone? Or maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a ketone via hydration. So back to E being acetone.

Next, compound E, which is acetone, reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Wait, iron scrap and HCl... that's probably a reducing condition. Acetone (propan-2-one) reacting with HCl and Fe. Oh, wait, that might be the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but sometimes Fe and HCl might be used in a similar context. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So acetone would be reduced to propane. So F would be propane, CH3CH2CH3.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Propane reacting with nitrous acid? Wait, nitrous acid typically reacts with amines or alcohols, but alkanes? Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.

Wait, if E is acetone, and F is propane, then F is CH3CH2CH3. Reacting with nitrous acid, which is typically used in the HNO2 reactions for diazotization of amines. But alkanes don't react with HNO2. So maybe I'm wrong in the prior steps. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps when D is reacted with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Let me think: perhaps D (propyne) undergoes some kind of addition. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with concentrated sulfuric acid could lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration would turn the alkyne into a ketone. So E would be acetone (propan-2-one). Then, F is the product of acetone reacting with Fe and HCl. That's definitely the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3). But then, F is propane, which is an alkane. Reacting with nitrous acid (which is an acid but not typically reactive with alkanes). Hmm.

Wait, maybe another approach. What if D is propyne, and reacting with a mixture of strong acids leads to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O2? Or maybe H2SO4 and another acid like HNO3. Alternatively, perhaps it's treating the alkyne with concentrated H2SO4 and heat, which might cause an acid-catalyzed hydration. So that would produce acetone.

But then, moving forward: F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid is HNO2. Wait, under certain conditions, alkanes can react with HNO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps HNO2 is used in the presence of a catalyst. Wait, perhaps F is propane, and nitrous acid is used in the presence of a catalyst to form something else. Wait, no, alkanes are generally unreactive unless under very high-energy conditions. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of E (acetone) with Fe and HCl isn't Clemmensen. Maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let me think about when propyne is treated with a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm. Wait, another thought: perhaps D (propyne) undergoes a reaction with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) to form a nitro compound. But I can't see how that would happen unless the alkyne is first converted into an aromatic ring, which doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and the reaction is a different kind of addition. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and HCl could form a chlorinated compound. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of propyne to form acetone. Let's go back to that.

So E is acetone. Then, F is the product of acetone with Fe and HCl. As I thought, Clemmensen gives propane. So F is propane. Then, when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid, what happens? Well, propane is an alkane and typically unreactive, so maybe G is the same as F? That doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps I made an error earlier.

Wait, maybe I messed up the earlier steps. Let me try to reevaluate.

Wait, initial step: A is C3H6, which is propene or propyne. Then it undergoes bromination in CCl4. For propene, bromination would be addition to form 1,2-dibromopropane. For propyne, bromination (if it's substitution) would form 1-bromo-propyne. But wait, in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, addition is likely for alkenes. So for propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it's an elimination reaction. So, elimination of two HBr molecules. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH: perhaps it's a double elimination, so we lose two HBr molecules, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is BrCH2CH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when this reacts with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr. So each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination could form either a double bond again, but wait, after elimination, it's back to propene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a different structure if elimination occurs differently.

Wait, another possibility: 1,2-dibromopropane could undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form propadiene (allene), but that's less likely. Because propadiene is less stable than propene. So perhaps it's more likely to form propene again. So C is propene.

Then, when C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it would undergo dehydrogenation to form propyne. So D is propyne, which is HC≡CCH3.

Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Let's think: propyne (HC≡CCH3) + strong acids. If the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O2, perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but H2O2 is not a strong acid. Alternatively, H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's a sulfonation followed by nitration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone. So E is acetone.

So E is acetone. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. As I thought, this is Clemmensen reduction, so F is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Hmm. Wait, I recall that nitrous acid can be used in the presence of a catalyst for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes, but F is propane, an alkane. So perhaps this step is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's think: F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid is not likely to do anything, so G would be the same as F, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's an error in the prior steps.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe E isn't acetone. Let me reevaluate D. D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids to form E. Could D be reacting via a different mechanism? For example, perhaps it's a halogenation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. But propyne is an alkyne, which can undergo hydrohalogenation. So adding HCl (a strong acid) to propyne would yield 1-chloropropane? Or 2-chloropropane? Wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. Adding HCl across the triple bond would give CH2Cl-C≡CCH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when HCl adds to an alkyne, it's typically in a two-step addition, giving a dihalide. So propyne with HCl would add twice, giving CH2Cl-C≡CCH2Cl? Wait, but that's a dihalide, which is less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are used in hydration of alkynes to form ketones. So E would be acetone. Then, F would be propane again.

Hmm. So going back, F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps the reaction to form G is incorrect, but the problem says 'which statement is incorrect', so perhaps one of the options is incorrect.

Now, moving on to the next step: G is the product of F (propane) reacting with nitrous acid. Since that doesn't make much sense, perhaps I made a mistake in prior steps. Alternatively, maybe E isn't acetone. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it undergoes a different reaction. Maybe it's a nitration reaction, but as I thought earlier, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and the reaction is some kind of oxidation. Propyne is HC≡CCH3. Oxidation of propyne would form propanoic acid (CH2(COOH)CH3)? Or maybe CO2 and H2O? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone, which is acetone.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and another acid, but I can't think of another option. So perhaps E is indeed acetone.

So F would be propane, which reacts with nitrous acid to give G. Since that doesn't make sense, perhaps the nitrous acid is reacting under different conditions. Wait, maybe F is not propane but something else. Let me check the reaction again.

Wait, E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, so F is propane. But then, how does propane react with nitrous acid? Hmm. Maybe the question is incorrect here, but the options are about which statement is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: let's list out all the compounds and their structures.

A: C3H6. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) or propyne (HC≡CCH3).

B: product of bromination of A in CCl4. For propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). For propyne, substitution would give 1-bromo-propyne (BrC≡CCH3), but since CCl4 is a solvent for addition, propene is more likely, so B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Elimination of HBr, so C is propene again (CH2=CHCH3).

D: C (propene) passed through hot iron. Dehydrogenation to propyne (HC≡CCH3).

E: D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids. Let's think: maybe concentrated H2SO4 and H2O. Under certain conditions, H2SO4 can cause hydration of alkynes to ketones. So E is acetone (CH3COCH3).

F: E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Clemmensen reduction gives propane (CH3CH2CH3).

G: F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Since alkanes don't react with HNO2, G remains propane. Hmm, but then the next step is when G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Wait, H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. If G is propane, then reacting with NaOH under what conditions? Propane doesn't react with NaOH. So something's wrong here.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the step where F is formed. Let me think again.

If E is something else, perhaps F is different. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps E is not acetone. What if D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids to form something else. Maybe it's undergoing a substitution reaction. Oh, wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. If it reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it undergoes some sulfonation or nitration. But alkyne sulfonation is possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but propyne is a terminal alkyne, so maybe it can undergo substitution.

Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) in the presence of H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's a nitration. But where? The terminal carbon is highly susceptible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone, which is acetone.

But then, moving back to F: acetone with Fe and HCl gives propane. Then, F is propane, which reacts with HNO2 to form G (propane, same as F), then G (propane) reacts with NaOH to form H (still same, as propane doesn't react with NaOH).

This suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe A is propyne, not propene. Let me try that.

If A is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then bromination in CCl4 would be substitution, since alkynes can undergo bromination via radical substitution. So B would be 1-bromo-propyne (BrC≡CCH3).

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base. So what happens when 1-bromo-propyne reacts with alcoholic KOH? It could undergo elimination. Wait, but 1-bromo-propyne is CH2Br-C≡CH? No, wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3, so 1-bromo is BrC≡CCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, perhaps elimination occurs. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but for alkynes. Wait, in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the alkyne would eliminate HBr. But in this case, the Br is on the terminal carbon. So elimination would form an alkyne with a triple bond and a double bond? Hmm, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is removed, leading to a new alkyne. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of 1-bromo-propyne with alcoholic KOH leads to the formation of propyne again. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by OH, but that would form an alkyne alcohol, which is less likely under these conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination, but I'm not certain. If the Br is on the terminal carbon, elimination could form an alkyne with a double bond? That might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each option and see which one is incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

Let's evaluate each option.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. C is the product after B reacts with alcoholic KOH. As we thought earlier, C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So D's statement is correct.

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). The structure is HC≡C-CH3. The protons on the CH3 group are all equivalent and would show up as a singlet. The proton on the HC≡C is a terminal alkyne proton, which would also be a singlet. Wait, but in NMR, the terminal alkyne proton is typically a singlet, and the methyl group is a singlet. So two singlets in the 1H NMR. So option C is correct.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, which turn yellow. So if H is a phenol, then B is correct. But in our reaction sequence, where would a phenol come from? Looking back, I don't see any steps that introduce an aromatic ring or a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring.

Wait, in the reaction steps, H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. If G is propane, then H is same as G, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in prior steps. Alternatively, perhaps H is something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reactions. Let me try to see.

Wait, perhaps E is not acetone. Let's think again.

D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids. Suppose the two acids are H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are used in hydration. So E is acetone. Then F is propane via Clemmensen. Then F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. Maybe this is a typo, and the reaction is with HNO3 instead, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps F is reacting with nitrous acid under different conditions. Wait, another thought: maybe F is propane, and G is propane. Then, when G reacts with NaOH, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is under high pressure or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the step where E is formed is incorrect. Let me think about D again.

If D is propyne, and it's treated with H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone, acetone. Then, F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of F with nitrous acid is forming an amine? But no, propane doesn't have any functional groups for that.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is propane. Propane is an alkane, which is a gas, but I don't think it's used in dye synthesis. Dyes are usually made from aromatic compounds or conjugated systems. So if F is propane, then option A is incorrect. But perhaps I'm wrong about F.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe F is something else. Let me think.

If E is not acetone, perhaps D reacts with the two acids to form something else. For example, if D is propyne, and it undergoes some kind of addition with the two acids, perhaps forming a diacid or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and they cause some kind of nitration on the alkyne, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alkynes can undergo nitration to form nitroalkynes, but I'm not certain about the conditions.

Wait, if E is nitropropyne, then F would be something else. Let's say E is nitropropyne (maybe HC≡CCH2NO2). Then, F is the product of E with Fe and HCl. But I don't know what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, and E is propanoic acid. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and H2O could undergo hydrolysis to form propargyl alcohol (CH2CH2CH3OH?), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration to form a ketone.

I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the options again.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. So H must be a phenol. How would H be a phenol?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me think: when D is propyne, and reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If E is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), then F would be propane via reduction. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids could be H2SO4 and another acid that acts as an oxidizing agent. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could oxidize to form propanoic acid. So E is propanoic acid.

Then, F is the product of E (propanoic acid) with Fe and HCl. But Fe and HCl are typically for reductions. Oh, wait, maybe it's a decarboxylation. Propanoic acid with Fe and HCl could lose CO2, forming propane. So F would be propane again.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. Then G is propane. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. But if G is propane, which doesn't react with NaOH, then H would be the same as G, which is propane. So option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. But H is propane, which doesn't have a phenolic group. So option B is incorrect. But wait, where would H be a phenol? There's no step in the sequence that introduces a phenolic group. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction steps. Let's see.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the two strong acids (when D is reacted) are H2SO4 and H2O, causing the alkyne to undergo oxidation. Propyne could oxidize to propanoic acid. Then E is propanoic acid. Then, F would be propane via decarboxylation with Fe and HCl. Then G is propane, which doesn't react with HNO2. So G is propane. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Propane doesn't react with NaOH, so H is same as G.

So option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. That would mean H is a phenol. But in our case, H is propane, which doesn't react with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a step where a phenol is formed. Let's think: in any of the steps, could an aromatic ring be formed?

Wait, when D (propyne) is reacted with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of cyclization. But I can't think of a way for propyne to form a benzene ring under those conditions. So no, H wouldn't be a phenol.

So, the incorrect statement is either option B or A.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is propane. Propane isn't used in dye synthesis. Dyes are typically made from aromatic compounds or conjugated systems. So option A is incorrect.

Wait, but if F is something else, like maybe butadiene or another compound, but in our case, F is propane. So option A is incorrect.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So option D is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets. D is propyne. The structure is HC≡CCH3. The H on the triple bond is one proton, a singlet. The CH3 group has three equivalent protons, another singlet. So two singlets, so option C is correct.

So, the incorrect statements are options A and B.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

If F is propane, then option A is incorrect because propane isn't used for dye synthesis. Option B is incorrect if H is propane, which doesn't react with FeCl3.

But the question is to choose the incorrect statement. So, both A and B could be incorrect, but the options are four, and only one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction steps. Let me think: maybe E is something else. If E is propanoic acid, then F is propane. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in the reaction where E is formed, it's a different product. Let me think about E again.

If D is propyne, and it's treated with H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps it's a hydration to form propargyl alcohol? No, wait, propargyl alcohol is CH2CH2CH2OH, which I don't think is relevant here.

Another possibility: perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the alkyne. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) with HCl would add HCl across the triple bond. So first addition would give CH2Cl-C≡CCH3. Then, a second addition would give CH2Cl-CH2Cl-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a dihalide. Then, F would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and another acid, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude based on the options.

Option A: F is propane. Propane isn't used in dye synthesis. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: H is propane, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so B is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is to choose one incorrect statement. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, because H is propane and doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in prior steps, and H is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the step where E is formed, it's a different product. Let me think: If D (propyne) is treated with a mixture of strong acids like H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of nitration. But without an aromatic ring, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is propionaldehyde, which upon reduction with Fe and HCl would form propane. Then F is propane.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is a different compound. But without more information, I'm stuck.

Given that, I'll proceed to the conclusion.

The options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect. Propane isn't used for dye synthesis.

B) H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. If H is propane, this is incorrect.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. D is propyne, which gives two singlets, so this is correct.

D) C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is flammable, so correct.

The question is to find the incorrect statement. So either A or B is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the reaction where F is formed, F is not propane but something else. Let me think: if E is propanoic acid, and F is propane, then F is propane. But perhaps another possibility: if E is something else, like a nitro compound.

But without knowing, I'll have to choose between A and B.

Another approach: looking at the options, which one is definitely incorrect regardless of the steps.

If H is not a phenol, then option B is incorrect. Because the ferric chloride test is for phenols.

In our reaction sequence, there's no step that introduces a phenolic group. So H cannot be a phenol, making option B incorrect.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is option B.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃) as compound B. When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a double elimination occurs, regenerating propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as compound C. 

Passing propene (C) through a red-hot iron tube results in dehydrogenation, forming propyne (HC≡CCH₃) as compound D. When D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and H₂O), it undergoes hydration to form acetone (CH₃COCH₃) as compound E. Acetone (E) is then reduced by Fe and HCl (Clemmensen reduction) to form propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) as compound F. 

Propane (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but alkanes like propane do not typically react with nitrous acid, so compound G remains propane. When G reacts with NaOH, it still remains propane, as alkanes do not react with NaOH. Thus, compound H is also propane.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: "F is used for the synthesis of dyes."  
   F is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃), which is not used in dye synthesis. This statement is **incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: "H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution."  
   Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to give a yellow color. However, H is propane, which does not contain a phenolic group and does not react with ferric chloride. This statement is **incorrect**.

3. **Option C**: "D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra."  
   D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃). The terminal alkyne proton (HC≡C-) and the methyl group (CH₃) each produce a singlet in the ¹H NMR spectrum. This statement is **correct**.

4. **Option D**: "C is a flammable gas."  
   C is propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), which is a flammable gas. This statement is **correct**.

### Conclusion:
Both options A and B are incorrect. However, since the question asks for a single incorrect statement, the most definitive choice is **Option B**, as H (propane) cannot react with ferric chloride to give a yellow color.

**Answer: B**
