Alright, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Okay, let's start by summarizing the given information. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, that's A + 8B → C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest that the stoichiometry is important here. Maybe it's a 1:8 ratio.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E. So, C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H.

And the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm. Molecular symmetry groups... I remember that symmetry groups are determined by the arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Common groups include things like D4h, which is high symmetry, maybe something like a square planar or octahedral structure.

Wait, maybe I should try to figure out what the substances are. Let's think about each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: solid A + 8 gas B → C. Red product... could that be something like copper(II) oxide reacting with something? Or maybe it's a metal reacting with a gas to form a compound. Alternatively, I'm thinking of the reaction where a metal reacts with chlorine gas, but 8 equivalents seem high. Wait, let's think about metals and halogens.

Another possibility: perhaps A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine gas (Cl2). But Na would react with Cl2 in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's aluminum reacting with something else.

Wait, another thought: when solid metals like sodium or aluminum react with chlorine, they form chlorides. But Sodium would form NaCl, which is a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but the first reaction is 1 A to 8 B. So, maybe the formula is ACl8? But that seems unusual. Maybe A is iron, but iron usually reacts in 2:3 or 3:4 ratios with Cl2. Hmm, not fitting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with something... but I'm not sure. Let me think of the product C being bright red. Oh! I remember that when a metal like iron reacts with sulfur, it forms iron sulfide, which is black, not red. Alternatively, could it be the formation of a chromium compound? Chromium trioxide is orange, but I don't know about red.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bright red product is lead dioxide (PbO2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like sulfur trioxide, but that's a gas, not a solid.

Wait, another angle: the third reaction is C reacting with water to form A, and two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, if C is a sulfide or something, but wait, when a sulfide reacts with water, it can produce H2S, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide reacting with water to produce a metal hydroxide and an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me think: if C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it forms a metal hydroxide (which is A), and two acids. But two different acids? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. Or maybe C is a salt that reacts with water to form an acid and a base. Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So, F and G are acids. So, if C is an anhydride of some sort, maybe a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another thought—maybe C is a metal nitride. For example, sodium nitride (Na3N) reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide and ammonia (NH3). But ammonia is a weak base, not an acid, so that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like CaC2, which reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not an acid either.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If D is a gas, maybe it's something like O2 or Cl2. Wait, in the fourth reaction, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, H is a solvent, perhaps something like H2O, or maybe ethanol or something else.

Wait, H is a solvent, so maybe it's a common solvent. Let me think: if D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. If B is Cl2, perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, if B is O2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is H2, but that's a gas as well.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O. Because in the fourth reaction, D + B → H, which is a solvent. If D is H2O and B is something like Na (a solid?), but Na + H2O gives NaOH and H2. So, H would be NaOH, which is a strong base, but it's a liquid, so maybe that's a possibility.

But wait, in the fourth reaction, H is a solvent. So, perhaps D is O2 and B is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that doesn't fit with the 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like ethanol, which is a solvent. So, D and B combine to form ethanol. But what would B and D be? Maybe D is H2O and B is C2H5OH, but that doesn't make sense because B is a gas. Wait, B is a gas in the first reaction. So, B can't be ethanol, which is a liquid.

Another thought: maybe D is H2O and B is O2. Then, H would be H2O2? No, because O2 and H2O don't react in 1:1. Alternatively, B is H2, D is O2, and H is H2O. So, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1 if you take 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2. So, D is O2 and B is H2. Then, H is H2O, which is a solvent.

But back to the first reaction. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C. So, A + 8 H2 → C. What reacts with H2 in high quantities? Maybe a transition metal. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and reacts with H2 to form FeH2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a reaction where a metal oxide reacts with hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a hydride.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a halogen. For example, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) react in a 2:1 ratio to form NaCl. But in the first reaction, the ratio is 1:8, so 1A to 8B. So, perhaps A is Fe and B is Cl2. Iron can react with Cl2 in a 1:3 ratio to form FeCl3. But that's 3, not 8. Alternatively, maybe a different ratio. Wait, maybe A is something that forms a chloride with a higher ratio. Let me think: aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio, but again not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is O2. So in the first reaction, A is a metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. For example, sodium oxide (Na2O) would form from 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But that's 2:1, not 1:8. Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the product C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is Cr2O3, which is dark green. Not red. Hmm.

Another approach: the product E is extremely hazardous. What chemical is that? Maybe something like sarin gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's something like hydrogen cyanide, but that's not extremely hazardous in the same way.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of C reacting with gas D. If C is a metal oxide and D is a halogen or something else, perhaps forming a more dangerous compound. Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic gas, maybe it's a product like HCN, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to figure out the identities of the substances step by step. Let's make a table.

First Reaction: A + 8B → C (solid to solid/gas?)

Second Reaction: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous)

Third Reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G (two acids, F strong, G weak)

Fourth Reaction: D + B → H (solvent)

Hmm, what if B is Cl2? Let's see:

Fourth reaction: D + Cl2 → H (solvent). So D plus Cl2 gives a solvent. Possible solvents could be something like CHCl3 (chloroform), but that would require D to be CHCl2 or something. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and H is HCl? No, because H would be a solvent, but HCl is a gas. Maybe D is CH3Cl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps H is something like ethanol, which is a solvent. So D + B → ethanol. But B is Cl2, would that make sense? Wait, Cl2 and something else can form ethanol? Not that I know of. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the products.

In the third reaction, C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, if C is a metal oxide, like Al2O3, reacting with water would produce a metal hydroxide (A) and an acid? Wait, no. Aluminum oxide with water would produce aluminum hydroxide and possibly some acid if it's a basic oxide. Hmm, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a weak and strong acid. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfide. For example, ZnS reacts with water, but I think it's more of a base. Or maybe it's a nitride, like Mg3N2, which reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. MgCO3 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but Mg(OH)2 is a base. Hmm. But that would produce a base and an acid, but the question states F and G are acids. So, maybe C is a metal oxide that is amphoteric, like Al2O3. Al2O3 + H2O → Al(OH)3. But that's a neutral compound, not producing acids.

Wait, another approach: the third reaction produces two different acids, F strong and G weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids include CH3COOH, HCN, H2CO3, etc.

If F is HCl (strong acid) and G is HCN (weak acid), then perhaps C is a cyanide. For example, if C is sodium cyanide (NaCN), reacting with water might not produce HCl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis to produce two different acids. For example, maybe a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Let's think: If C is Na2S, then reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH (strong base) and H2S (weak acid). But then F would be NaOH (strong base, but the question says F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C contains both a strong acid anion and a weak acid anion. For example, if C is a mixture of chlorides and sulfates. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would form.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. Like, when a nitride reacts with water, it produces NH3 and a metal hydroxide. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps C is something like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to produce acetylene (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide. But acetylene isn't an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide and another acid. For example, perhaps if C is a superoxide, like KO2. KO2 reacts with water to produce O2 and KOH, but that's a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. O2 is a gas, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which reacts with water to produce sodium hydroxide (strong base) and carbonic acid (weak acid). But again, F and G are acids, so this would give one acid and a base. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. It reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, which is a weak acid). Again, that's one acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of two salts. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal that reacts with water to form an acid and another acid. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction again. C reacts with 2 D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas. What reactions produce such gases?

Another approach: perhaps D is a halogen, like Cl2. So, in the fourth reaction, D (Cl2) and B react to form H, a solvent. So, Cl2 + B → H. What reaction produces a solvent? Maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is CHCl3 (chloroform), but that would require B to be CH2Cl2, which is a solvent, but that doesn't fit because B is a gas.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. Then, H is H2O, which is a solvent. So, in the fourth reaction, O2 + H2 → H2O (adding 2 H2 and 1 O2 gives 2 H2O, but the stoichiometry is 1:1, so maybe D is O2 and B is H2 in a 1:1 ratio, but the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, the ratio of D (O2) to B (H2) is 1:2. But the question says their ratio is 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is C (carbon). Then, D + B → CO or CO2, but those aren't solvents. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethanol. Then, D + B → ethanol. If B is H2O, which is a liquid, but the question says B is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but B is a gas, which ethanol isn't. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe H is H2O, produced from D (O2) and B (H2) in a 1:1 ratio. But the actual reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1. So maybe that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let's think about the molecular symmetry group.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

I remember that D4h is the symmetry group for molecules like square planar (like some metal complexes), or octahedral with certain ligands. D∞h is for linear molecules, like CO2 (but CO2 has D∞h symmetry). Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, but that's a point group. So, if E is CO2, which is linear, then its symmetry group would be D∞h.

But wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If E is CO2, then D would be O2 perhaps? Or maybe D is something else.

Wait, let me think: if E is CO2, which is a linear molecule, then its symmetry group would be D∞h. So if the options include D∞h, which they do (option C), that could be the answer.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me see if E could be CO2.

In the first reaction, A + 8B → C. Then, C reacts with 2D → CO2.

Wait, let's say B is O2. Then, A + 8 O2 → C. What could A be? Hmm, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is FeO, but 8 O2 seems a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon. If A is carbon, then reacting with O2 (B) would form CO or CO2. But the product C is bright red. Hmm, CO is a gas and colorless, CO2 is a gas and colorless. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide. For example, iron reacts with oxygen to form FeO (black), Fe3O4 (black), or Fe2O3 (reddish). Oh! Fe2O3 is a bright red or orange solid. So, solid A could be iron metal, B is O2, and C is Fe2O3.

So, the first reaction would be Fe + O2 → Fe2O3 (with 8 equivalents? Let's check the stoichiometry. Fe + (3/2) O2 → Fe2O3. So, per mole of Fe, 1.5 moles of O2 are used. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used per A. So, if 8 moles of O2 react, how much Fe would that be? Let's see: the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So, for 4 Fe, 3 O2 are used. So per Fe mole, 3/4 O2 is used. So if 8 O2 are used, that would correspond to (8 * 4)/3 Fe, which is 32/3 ≈ 10.67 moles Fe. Hmm, that might not fit, but maybe the question isn't precise about stoichiometry.

But if C is Fe2O3, then the third reaction is Fe2O3 + H2O → Fe + F + G. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Fe2O3 is a metal oxide. Reacting with water usually doesn't produce the metal; instead, it forms a hydroxide. So, Fe2O3 + 3 H2O → 2 Fe(OH)3 + H2↑? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the metal oxide is amphoteric. Aluminum oxide reacts with water but doesn't produce the metal.

Wait, maybe C is not a metal oxide. Let me think again.

Another possibility: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is Cr2O3, which is dark green. Not bright red. But maybe another form.

Alternatively, could C be a sulfide? For instance, PbS is bright red. So, if C is PbS, then in the third reaction, PbS reacts with water. But PbS is insoluble in water. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. Lead nitrate is a bright yellow solid. But the product is red.

Another thought: perhaps the bright red product is a different kind of compound, like a coordination complex. For example, [Fe(SCN)]n complexes are red, but I'm not sure about the formation.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where a metal reacts with chlorine gas to form a chloride. For example, magnesium reacts with Cl2 to form MgCl2. But the product is white, not red.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is mercuric oxide (HgO), but I think that's red, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfur compound. If A is sulfur, and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the third reaction. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both nitrate (strong acid anion) and carbonate (weak acid anion). For example, if C is sodium nitrate (but that wouldn't form two acids upon hydrolysis). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a mixed salt, like sodium nitrate and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3 reacts with water to produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). So, F would be CO2 (though it's a weak acid), and G would be NaOH (a strong base, not an acid). Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. Then, Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. O2 is a gas, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should try to focus on the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If E is a dangerous gas, maybe it's something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or phosgene (COCl2). Phosgene is a highly toxic gas. But how would that form?

If D is COCl2 (phosgene), then C would have to be something that reacts with it. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if D is H2O, then C + 2 H2O → E. If E is a dangerous gas, maybe HCl gas? But then, C would be HClO (hypochlorous acid), which upon further reaction with H2O might produce HCl and HOCl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fourth reaction again. D + B → H, a solvent.

If B is H2O, but B is a gas, so that's not possible.

Wait, let me think about H being a solvent. Maybe H is ethanol. So, D + B → ethanol. Since B is a gas, perhaps D is H2O and B is C2H5OH (but that's a liquid, not a gas). Hmm.

Alternatively, H could be methanol. So, D + B → CH3OH. What reacts to form methanol? Maybe CO2 + H2 → CH3OH with a catalyst, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is CO, but that's speculative.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to approach this from another angle. Let's think about the possible molecular symmetry groups.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

- C2: a two-fold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O2 have C2 symmetry.

- D4h: dihedral group with 4-fold rotation and mirror planes. Molecules like SO4^2- (but that's a tetrahedral group) or maybe something like CCl4 (which is Td, not D4h). Hmm, perhaps something like square planar complexes, like [PtCl4]^2-.

- D∞h: infinite symmetry along an axis, like CO2 and H2O (which have D∞h symmetry). Wait, no, H2O has C2v symmetry. CO2 is linear, so D∞h.

- C2v: has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. Molecules like H2O have C2v symmetry.

So, if E is a linear molecule, like CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a molecule with a C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes, like H2O, then it's C2v.

Now, which of these is more likely for a dangerous gas? Well, phosgene (COCl2) has a structure with a central carbon, so maybe C2v symmetry. Or, for example, H2O has C2v.

Wait, but another dangerous gas is chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which has a trigonal pyramidal structure and D3h symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. D4h is common for molecules like octahedral complexes (but those are usually Oh symmetry). Square planar complexes (like some metal complexes) have D4h symmetry.

Wait, but if E is a square planar molecule, which is a solid or a gas? For example, [Ni(CN)4]^2- is square planar, but it's an ion, not a gas.

Hmm, perhaps E is a gas with a high symmetry. Let me think: O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D to form O2. So, C + 2 D → O2. How would that happen? Maybe C is a compound that decomposes to release O2. For example, if C is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 decomposes to H2O and O2. So, 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. But then, D would be H2O2. But in the fourth reaction, D + B → H. If D is H2O2, and B is something else, perhaps H would be a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that decomposes upon reaction with D to form O2. For example, if C is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which can decompose. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back. If E is O2, then its symmetry group is D∞h. That's one of the options (option C). Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear, then it's D∞h as well.

But wait, earlier in the third reaction, C reacts with water to produce F and G, which are acids. So, if C is a carbonate, let's say. Suppose C is Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2↑. So, F would be CO2 (weak acid) and G would be NaOH (strong base). But the question says F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Na2SO4 reacting with water doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. Suppose C is FeS. Then, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S↑. H2S is a weak acid. So, F and G could be H2S and something else, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + NH3↑. NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, if C is a carbide, like CaC2. CaC2 + H2O → C2H2↑ + Ca(OH)2. C2H2 (acetylene) is a weak acid? I don't think so. Acetylene is a hydrocarbon, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should think about the acids. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps F is HCl and G is HCN, or something like that.

If F is HCl and G is HCN, then C would need to be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, produces both. But I'm not sure what such a compound would be.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorocyanide or something. But I'm not familiar with such a compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. So, F would be NaOH (strong base), which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the strong acid F and weak acid G. Strong acids are usually those with very strong O-H bonds, like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids have weaker bonds, like HCN, H2CO3, H2SO3, etc.

So, if F is HCl and G is H2SO3, then C would be a compound that upon reaction with water produces both. But I don't know of such a compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixture of Cl and SO3 groups. But that's too vague.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the second reaction again. C + 2 D → E. If E is O2, then C + 2 D → O2. What could D be? Maybe D is H2O2, which decomposes to O2. So, 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. So, C is H2O2. Then, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → H2O2. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a solid. So C is a solid, which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which is a yellow gas. But Cl2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry.

If E is Cl2, then symmetry group is D∞h. So, option C.

But how would C + 2 D → Cl2 happen? Let's think. If D is Cl2, but that would require C to be something that reacts with Cl2 to produce Cl2, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps D is a chlorinating agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is OCl3 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, then perhaps C is a chloride that decomposes to release Cl2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaClO3, which upon reaction with D (maybe H2SO4) could decompose to produce Cl2. So, 2 NaClO3 + H2SO4 → 2 NaHSO4 + Cl2↑ + O2↑. Hmm, that's a possible reaction. In this case, D would be H2SO4.

Then, in the fourth reaction, D (H2SO4) and B react to form H, a solvent. What reaction of H2SO4 with B (a gas) would produce a solvent? Maybe B is C (carbon), and H is CO or something. Hmm, not sure.

But let's see, if E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C. But I'm not sure if this fits all the other reactions.

Wait, let's check the third reaction again. C is NaClO3, which upon reacting with H2O would produce what? NaClO3 is a salt, and it's not very soluble in water. Or, in the presence of acid, it could decompose, but in water, perhaps it doesn't react much. So that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should just make an educated guess based on the information given.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h. So, looking at the options, option C is D∞h.

So, I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry and the description of C as "bright red" suggest that C could be a compound like Fe₂O₃ (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish in color. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as an extremely hazardous product. If E is a linear molecule like CO₂ or O₂, it would have high symmetry. For example, O₂ is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C might be a salt or compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids. However, the exact nature of C remains ambiguous.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This provides limited information about D and B but indicates that their reaction produces a common solvent.

5. **Symmetry Group Analysis**: The molecular symmetry group of E is determined by its structure. If E is a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂, it would have D∞h symmetry. This matches the description of a highly hazardous gas with linear symmetry.

Given the options and the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, consistent with a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂.

**Answer: C**

Alright, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Okay, let's start by summarizing the given information. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, that's A + 8B → C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest that the stoichiometry is important here. Maybe it's a 1:8 ratio.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E. So, C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H.

And the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm. Molecular symmetry groups... I remember that symmetry groups are determined by the arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Common groups include things like D4h, which is high symmetry, maybe something like a square planar or octahedral structure.

Wait, maybe I should try to figure out what the substances are. Let's think about each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: solid A + 8 gas B → C. Red product... could that be something like copper(II) oxide reacting with something? Or maybe it's a metal reacting with a gas to form a compound. Alternatively, I'm thinking of the reaction where a metal reacts with chlorine gas, but 8 equivalents seem high. Wait, let's think about metals and halogens.

Another possibility: perhaps A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine gas (Cl2). But Na would react with Cl2 in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's aluminum reacting with something else.

Wait, another thought: when solid metals like sodium or aluminum react with chlorine, they form chlorides. But Sodium would form NaCl, which is a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but the first reaction is 1 A to 8 B. So, maybe the formula is ACl8? But that seems unusual. Maybe A is iron, but iron usually reacts in 2:3 or 3:4 ratios with Cl2. Hmm, not fitting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with something... but I'm not sure. Let me think of the product C being bright red. Oh! I remember that when a metal like iron reacts with sulfur, it forms iron sulfide, which is black, not red. Alternatively, could it be the formation of a chromium compound? Chromium trioxide is orange, but I don't know about red.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bright red product is lead dioxide (PbO2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like sulfur trioxide, but that's a gas, not a solid.

Wait, another angle: the third reaction is C reacting with water to form A, and two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, if C is a sulfide or something, but wait, when a sulfide reacts with water, it can produce H2S, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide reacting with water to produce a metal hydroxide and an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me think: if C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it forms a metal hydroxide (which is A), and two acids. But two different acids? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. Or maybe C is a salt that reacts with water to form an acid and a base. Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So, F and G are acids. So, if C is an anhydride of some sort, maybe a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another thought—maybe C is a metal nitride. For example, sodium nitride (Na3N) reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide and ammonia (NH3). But ammonia is a weak base, not an acid, so that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like CaC2, which reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not an acid either.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If D is a gas, maybe it's something like O2 or Cl2. Wait, in the fourth reaction, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, H is a solvent, perhaps something like H2O, or maybe ethanol or something else.

Wait, H is a solvent, so maybe it's a common solvent. Let me think: if D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. If B is Cl2, perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, if B is O2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is H2, but that's a gas as well.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O. Because in the fourth reaction, D + B → H, which is a solvent. If D is H2O and B is something like Na (a solid?), but Na + H2O gives NaOH and H2. So, H would be NaOH, which is a strong base, but it's a liquid, so maybe that's a possibility.

But wait, in the fourth reaction, H is a solvent. So, perhaps D is O2 and B is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that doesn't fit with the 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like ethanol, which is a solvent. So, D and B combine to form ethanol. But what would B and D be? Maybe D is H2O and B is C2H5OH, but that doesn't make sense because B is a gas. Wait, B is a gas in the first reaction. So, B can't be ethanol, which is a liquid.

Another thought: maybe D is H2O and B is O2. Then, H would be H2O2? No, because O2 and H2O don't react in 1:1. Alternatively, B is H2, D is O2, and H is H2O. So, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1 if you take 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2. So, D is O2 and B is H2. Then, H is H2O, which is a solvent.

But back to the first reaction. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C. So, A + 8 H2 → C. What reacts with H2 in high quantities? Maybe a transition metal. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and reacts with H2 to form FeH2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a reaction where a metal oxide reacts with hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a hydride.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a halogen. For example, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) react in a 2:1 ratio to form NaCl. But in the first reaction, the ratio is 1:8, so 1A to 8B. So, perhaps A is Fe and B is Cl2. Iron can react with Cl2 in a 1:3 ratio to form FeCl3. But that's 3, not 8. Alternatively, maybe a different ratio. Wait, maybe A is something that forms a chloride with a higher ratio. Let me think: aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio, but again not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is O2. So in the first reaction, A is a metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. For example, sodium oxide (Na2O) would form from 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But that's 2:1, not 1:8. Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the product C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is Cr2O3, which is dark green. Not red. Hmm.

Another approach: the product E is extremely hazardous. What chemical is that? Maybe something like sarin gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's something like hydrogen cyanide, but that's not extremely hazardous in the same way.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of C reacting with gas D. If C is a metal oxide and D is a halogen or something else, perhaps forming a more dangerous compound. Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic gas, maybe it's a product like HCN, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to figure out the identities of the substances step by step. Let's make a table.

First Reaction: A + 8B → C (solid to solid/gas?)

Second Reaction: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous)

Third Reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G (two acids, F strong, G weak)

Fourth Reaction: D + B → H (solvent)

Hmm, what if B is Cl2? Let's see:

Fourth reaction: D + Cl2 → H (solvent). So D plus Cl2 gives a solvent. Possible solvents could be something like CHCl3 (chloroform), but that would require D to be CHCl2 or something. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and H is HCl? No, because H would be a solvent, but HCl is a gas. Maybe D is CH3Cl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps H is something like ethanol, which is a solvent. So D + B → ethanol. But B is Cl2, would that make sense? Wait, Cl2 and something else can form ethanol? Not that I know of. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the products.

In the third reaction, C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, if C is a metal oxide, like Al2O3, reacting with water would produce a metal hydroxide (A) and an acid? Wait, no. Aluminum oxide with water would produce aluminum hydroxide and possibly some acid if it's a basic oxide. Hmm, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a weak and strong acid. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfide. For example, ZnS reacts with water, but I think it's more of a base. Or maybe it's a nitride, like Mg3N2, which reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. MgCO3 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but Mg(OH)2 is a base. Hmm. But that would produce a base and an acid, but the question states F and G are acids. So, maybe C is a metal oxide that is amphoteric, like Al2O3. Al2O3 + H2O → Al(OH)3. But that's a neutral compound, not producing acids.

Wait, another approach: the third reaction produces two different acids, F strong and G weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids include CH3COOH, HCN, H2CO3, etc.

If F is HCl (strong acid) and G is HCN (weak acid), then perhaps C is a cyanide. For example, if C is sodium cyanide (NaCN), reacting with water might not produce HCl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis to produce two different acids. For example, maybe a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Let's think: If C is Na2S, then reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH (strong base) and H2S (weak acid). But then F would be NaOH (strong base, but the question says F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C contains both a strong acid anion and a weak acid anion. For example, if C is a mixture of chlorides and sulfates. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would form.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. Like, when a nitride reacts with water, it produces NH3 and a metal hydroxide. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps C is something like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to produce acetylene (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide. But acetylene isn't an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide and another acid. For example, perhaps if C is a superoxide, like KO2. KO2 reacts with water to produce O2 and KOH, but that's a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. O2 is a gas, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which reacts with water to produce sodium hydroxide (strong base) and carbonic acid (weak acid). But again, F and G are acids, so this would give one acid and a base. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. It reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, which is a weak acid). Again, that's one acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of two salts. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal that reacts with water to form an acid and another acid. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction again. C reacts with 2 D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas. What reactions produce such gases?

Another approach: perhaps D is a halogen, like Cl2. So, in the fourth reaction, D (Cl2) and B react to form H, a solvent. So, Cl2 + B → H. What reaction produces a solvent? Maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is CHCl3 (chloroform), but that would require B to be CH2Cl2, which is a solvent, but that doesn't fit because B is a gas.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. Then, H is H2O, which is a solvent. So, in the fourth reaction, O2 + H2 → H2O (adding 2 H2 and 1 O2 gives 2 H2O, but the stoichiometry is 1:1, so maybe D is O2 and B is H2 in a 1:1 ratio, but the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, the ratio of D (O2) to B (H2) is 1:2. But the question says their ratio is 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is C (carbon). Then, D + B → CO or CO2, but those aren't solvents. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethanol. Then, D + B → ethanol. If B is H2O, which is a liquid, but the question says B is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but B is a gas, which ethanol isn't. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe H is H2O, produced from D (O2) and B (H2) in a 1:1 ratio. But the actual reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1. So maybe that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let's think about the molecular symmetry group.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

I remember that D4h is the symmetry group for molecules like square planar (like some metal complexes), or octahedral with certain ligands. D∞h is for linear molecules, like CO2 (but CO2 has D∞h symmetry). Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, but that's a point group. So, if E is CO2, which is linear, then its symmetry group would be D∞h.

But wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If E is CO2, then D would be O2 perhaps? Or maybe D is something else.

Wait, let me think: if E is CO2, which is a linear molecule, then its symmetry group would be D∞h. So if the options include D∞h, which they do (option C), that could be the answer.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me see if E could be CO2.

In the first reaction, A + 8B → C. Then, C reacts with 2D → CO2.

Wait, let's say B is O2. Then, A + 8 O2 → C. What could A be? Hmm, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is FeO, but 8 O2 seems a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon. If A is carbon, then reacting with O2 (B) would form CO or CO2. But the product C is bright red. Hmm, CO is a gas and colorless, CO2 is a gas and colorless. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide. For example, iron reacts with oxygen to form FeO (black), Fe3O4 (black), or Fe2O3 (reddish). Oh! Fe2O3 is a bright red or orange solid. So, solid A could be iron metal, B is O2, and C is Fe2O3.

So, the first reaction would be Fe + O2 → Fe2O3 (with 8 equivalents? Let's check the stoichiometry. Fe + (3/2) O2 → Fe2O3. So, per mole of Fe, 1.5 moles of O2 are used. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used per A. So, if 8 moles of O2 react, how much Fe would that be? Let's see: the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So, for 4 Fe, 3 O2 are used. So per Fe mole, 3/4 O2 is used. So if 8 O2 are used, that would correspond to (8 * 4)/3 Fe, which is 32/3 ≈ 10.67 moles Fe. Hmm, that might not fit, but maybe the question isn't precise about stoichiometry.

But if C is Fe2O3, then the third reaction is Fe2O3 + H2O → Fe + F + G. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Fe2O3 is a metal oxide. Reacting with water usually doesn't produce the metal; instead, it forms a hydroxide. So, Fe2O3 + 3 H2O → 2 Fe(OH)3 + H2↑? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the metal oxide is amphoteric. Aluminum oxide reacts with water but doesn't produce the metal.

Wait, maybe C is not a metal oxide. Let me think again.

Another possibility: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is Cr2O3, which is dark green. Not bright red. But maybe another form.

Alternatively, could C be a sulfide? For instance, PbS is bright red. So, if C is PbS, then in the third reaction, PbS reacts with water. But PbS is insoluble in water. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. Lead nitrate is a bright yellow solid. But the product is red.

Another thought: perhaps the bright red product is a different kind of compound, like a coordination complex. For example, [Fe(SCN)]n complexes are red, but I'm not sure about the formation.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where a metal reacts with chlorine gas to form a chloride. For example, magnesium reacts with Cl2 to form MgCl2. But the product is white, not red.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is mercuric oxide (HgO), but I think that's red, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfur compound. If A is sulfur, and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the third reaction. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both nitrate (strong acid anion) and carbonate (weak acid anion). For example, if C is sodium nitrate (but that wouldn't form two acids upon hydrolysis). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a mixed salt, like sodium nitrate and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3 reacts with water to produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). So, F would be CO2 (though it's a weak acid), and G would be NaOH (a strong base, not an acid). Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. Then, Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. O2 is a gas, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should try to focus on the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If E is a dangerous gas, maybe it's something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or phosgene (COCl2). Phosgene is a highly toxic gas. But how would that form?

If D is COCl2 (phosgene), then C would have to be something that reacts with it. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if D is H2O, then C + 2 H2O → E. If E is a dangerous gas, maybe HCl gas? But then, C would be HClO (hypochlorous acid), which upon further reaction with H2O might produce HCl and HOCl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fourth reaction again. D + B → H, a solvent.

If B is H2O, but B is a gas, so that's not possible.

Wait, let me think about H being a solvent. Maybe H is ethanol. So, D + B → ethanol. Since B is a gas, perhaps D is H2O and B is C2H5OH (but that's a liquid, not a gas). Hmm.

Alternatively, H could be methanol. So, D + B → CH3OH. What reacts to form methanol? Maybe CO2 + H2 → CH3OH with a catalyst, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is CO, but that's speculative.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to approach this from another angle. Let's think about the possible molecular symmetry groups.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

- C2: a two-fold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O2 have C2 symmetry.

- D4h: dihedral group with 4-fold rotation and mirror planes. Molecules like SO4^2- (but that's a tetrahedral group) or maybe something like CCl4 (which is Td, not D4h). Hmm, perhaps something like square planar complexes, like [PtCl4]^2-.

- D∞h: infinite symmetry along an axis, like CO2 and H2O (which have D∞h symmetry). Wait, no, H2O has C2v symmetry. CO2 is linear, so D∞h.

- C2v: has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. Molecules like H2O have C2v symmetry.

So, if E is a linear molecule, like CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a molecule with a C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes, like H2O, then it's C2v.

Now, which of these is more likely for a dangerous gas? Well, phosgene (COCl2) has a structure with a central carbon, so maybe C2v symmetry. Or, for example, H2O has C2v.

Wait, but another dangerous gas is chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which has a trigonal pyramidal structure and D3h symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. D4h is common for molecules like octahedral complexes (but those are usually Oh symmetry). Square planar complexes (like some metal complexes) have D4h symmetry.

Wait, but if E is a square planar molecule, which is a solid or a gas? For example, [Ni(CN)4]^2- is square planar, but it's an ion, not a gas.

Hmm, perhaps E is a gas with a high symmetry. Let me think: O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D to form O2. So, C + 2 D → O2. How would that happen? Maybe C is a compound that decomposes to release O2. For example, if C is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 decomposes to H2O and O2. So, 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. But then, D would be H2O2. But in the fourth reaction, D + B → H. If D is H2O2, and B is something else, perhaps H would be a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that decomposes upon reaction with D to form O2. For example, if C is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which can decompose. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back. If E is O2, then its symmetry group is D∞h. That's one of the options (option C). Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear, then it's D∞h as well.

But wait, earlier in the third reaction, C reacts with water to produce F and G, which are acids. So, if C is a carbonate, let's say. Suppose C is Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2↑. So, F would be CO2 (weak acid) and G would be NaOH (strong base). But the question says F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Na2SO4 reacting with water doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. Suppose C is FeS. Then, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S↑. H2S is a weak acid. So, F and G could be H2S and something else, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + NH3↑. NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, if C is a carbide, like CaC2. CaC2 + H2O → C2H2↑ + Ca(OH)2. C2H2 (acetylene) is a weak acid? I don't think so. Acetylene is a hydrocarbon, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should think about the acids. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps F is HCl and G is HCN, or something like that.

If F is HCl and G is HCN, then C would need to be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, produces both. But I'm not sure what such a compound would be.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorocyanide or something. But I'm not familiar with such a compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. So, F would be NaOH (strong base), which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the strong acid F and weak acid G. Strong acids are usually those with very strong O-H bonds, like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids have weaker bonds, like HCN, H2CO3, H2SO3, etc.

So, if F is HCl and G is H2SO3, then C would be a compound that upon reaction with water produces both. But I don't know of such a compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixture of Cl and SO3 groups. But that's too vague.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the second reaction again. C + 2 D → E. If E is O2, then C + 2 D → O2. What could D be? Maybe D is H2O2, which decomposes to O2. So, 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. So, C is H2O2. Then, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → H2O2. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a solid. So C is a solid, which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which is a yellow gas. But Cl2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry.

If E is Cl2, then symmetry group is D∞h. So, option C.

But how would C + 2 D → Cl2 happen? Let's think. If D is Cl2, but that would require C to be something that reacts with Cl2 to produce Cl2, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps D is a chlorinating agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is OCl3 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, then perhaps C is a chloride that decomposes to release Cl2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaClO3, which upon reaction with D (maybe H2SO4) could decompose to produce Cl2. So, 2 NaClO3 + H2SO4 → 2 NaHSO4 + Cl2↑ + O2↑. Hmm, that's a possible reaction. In this case, D would be H2SO4.

Then, in the fourth reaction, D (H2SO4) and B react to form H, a solvent. What reaction of H2SO4 with B (a gas) would produce a solvent? Maybe B is C (carbon), and H is CO or something. Hmm, not sure.

But let's see, if E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C. But I'm not sure if this fits all the other reactions.

Wait, let's check the third reaction again. C is NaClO3, which upon reacting with H2O would produce what? NaClO3 is a salt, and it's not very soluble in water. Or, in the presence of acid, it could decompose, but in water, perhaps it doesn't react much. So that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should just make an educated guess based on the information given.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h. So, looking at the options, option C is D∞h.

So, I'll go with that.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry and the description of C as "bright red" suggest that C could be a compound like Fe₂O₃ (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish in color. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as an extremely hazardous product. If E is a linear molecule like CO₂ or O₂, it would have high symmetry. For example, O₂ is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C might be a salt or compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids. However, the exact nature of C remains ambiguous.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This provides limited information about D and B but indicates that their reaction produces a common solvent.

5. **Symmetry Group Analysis**: The molecular symmetry group of E is determined by its structure. If E is a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂, it would have D∞h symmetry. This matches the description of a highly hazardous gas with linear symmetry.

Given the options and the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, consistent with a linear molecule like O₂ or CO₂.

**Answer: C**
