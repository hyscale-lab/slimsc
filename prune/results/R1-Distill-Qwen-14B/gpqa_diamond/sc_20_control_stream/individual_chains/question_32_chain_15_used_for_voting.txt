Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Li typically has 3 protons, but with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? So Li-6 nuclei.

The options given are four different energies in GeV. I need to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this. I think it's a relativistic mechanics problem because we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, 0.96c is pretty fast.

So, the first thing I should figure out is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, how do I find that? I know that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated by taking the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But maybe there's a simpler way since the problem doesn't give any specific data on binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps they just want me to use the rest mass in terms of a known particle.

Wait, I think for such problems, the rest mass is often considered as the mass number times the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron). Because protons and neutrons have almost the same mass, around 938 MeV/c² each. So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 6 nucleons.

So, the rest mass m would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. I remember that the actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of the binding energy. However, since the problem doesn't provide any specific data, perhaps we're supposed to ignore that and just take the rest mass as 6 * (proton mass), which is a common approximation in such problems.

So, m = 6 * (938 MeV/c²) = 5.628 GeV/c².

Now, the kinetic energy plus the rest energy is the total energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, wait. I'm a bit confused about this point. Let me think. When they say the energy of the collider, do they refer to the kinetic energy per particle or the total energy?

Wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually mean the kinetic energy plus the rest energy, because the particles are moving at relativistic speeds. So the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma.

So, v = 0.96c. Let's compute beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/ sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, exact calculation: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c². Since m c² is 5.628 GeV, E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.628.

Hmm, 3.5 * 5.6 is 19.6. Let me compute more accurately:

3.5714 * 5.628 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.628.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857
3.5714 * 0.628 = ?

0.628 can be broken into 0.6, 0.02, and 0.008.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 * 0.02 = 0.071428
3.5714 * 0.008 = 0.0285712

Adding these together: 2.14284 + 0.071428 = 2.214268 + 0.0285712 = 2.2428392

So total is 17.857 + 2.2428392 = 20.0998392 GeV.

So approximately 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to my calculation.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Because Li-6 has a precise mass, perhaps I should find the exact mass instead of using 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV because of the binding energy. Let me think about that. The mass of a nucleus is given by the mass defect formula: M = Z*m_p + N*m_n - M_nucleus. But since m_p and m_n are almost the same (proton is about 938.272 MeV, neutron is about 939.565 MeV), the average is around 938.9 MeV.

But perhaps for this problem, they just expect us to use the mass number (A=6) times the proton mass as a rough estimate. But wait, the exact value might be necessary for the correct option.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. But since I don't have that data, perhaps the calculation is intended to be done with the approximation.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually (number of protons + neutrons) × (average mass of a nucleon) minus binding energy. But without exact data, this is tricky. So perhaps the problem expects us to simply take the rest mass as A × (mass of a proton), which in this case is 6 * 938 MeV/c², so 5.628 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which is a collider. So each beam has particles moving in opposite directions. So in this case, the total energy would be considering both beams? Or is each beam's energy the value we're calculating and the total would be double? No, wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps it's the energy per nucleus per beam.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC", which is likely the total energy imparted to each nucleus. So each nucleus has a certain energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), not the total energy (gamma mc² - mc²). Because sometimes, when people talk about the kinetic energy of particles in colliders, they refer to the kinetic part.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, the energy in the collider's context is usually the total energy. Because for relativistic particles, the kinetic energy is approximately equal to the total energy when v is near c. But wait, that's not exactly true. Let's think.

The total energy E is gamma mc², and the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) mc².

So for v=0.96c, gamma is about 3.5714, so K = (3.5714 -1) * 5.628 GeV = 2.5714 *5.628 ≈ 14.45 GeV.

But the options are all in the high teens to low twenties, so that's not matching. So that suggests that the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because 20 GeV is one of the options.

So back to the calculation: E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ 20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which matches.

Wait, but let me recompute gamma more accurately. Because I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28, which is exact, but let me confirm:

0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So, precisely, gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

Now, m c² is 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So the product is 3.5714286 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714286 * 5.628.

Breaking it down:

3 * 5.628 = 16.884
0.5714286 *5.628.

Wait, 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814. 0.0714286 *5.628 is approximately 0.40411... So 2.814 + 0.40411 ≈ 3.21811.

So total is 16.884 + 3.21811 ≈ 20.10211 GeV.

So approximately 20.102 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe because I used 938 MeV for each nucleon. But the actual mass of the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

Wait, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the exact rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Hmm, so the more precise rest mass is about 5.6335 GeV.

So let's recompute gamma * m c² with this more accurate m.

Gamma is 3.5714286.

So 3.5714286 * 5.633511 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.5714286 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511 = 2.8167555.

0.0714286 *5.633511 ≈ 0.40443.

So 2.8167555 + 0.40443 = 3.2211855.

Adding to 16.900533: 16.900533 + 3.2211855 = 20.1217185 GeV.

So approximately 20.1217 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but not exact. Why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the gamma calculation.

Wait, another way: let me compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857....

So gamma is exactly 35/10, wait no, 3.57142857 is 25/7, approximately.

Wait, 25/7 is 3.57142857... So yes.

So gamma is 25/7.

So m c² is 5.633511 GeV.

So E = (25/7) * 5.633511.

Compute 25 * 5.633511 = ?

5 *5.633511 is 28.167555.

Wait, 5.633511 * 25:

5 *25 =125, 0.633511 *25=15.837775.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 5.633511 *25 = (5 + 0.633511) *25 = 125 + (0.633511 *25) = 125 +15.837775 = 140.837775.

Then, divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 ≈ 20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the problem is considering the kinetic energy as the total energy provided by the collider. Let me see.

If E is the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) m c².

Earlier, with m c²=5.6335 GeV, gamma is 3.5714.

So E = (3.5714 -1) *5.6335 = 2.5714 *5.6335 ≈ 14.48 GeV. But the options are higher, so that's not it.

So the initial approach was correct, that it's the total energy (gamma * mc²). So the correct energy is approximately 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). So why is there a slight difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but the exact mass is known. The standard atomic weight includes electrons as well, but here we're talking about the nucleus, so we don't include electrons.

The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.017293 u (atomic mass units). One atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.017293 u is 6.017293 *931.5 ≈ 5629.5 MeV, which is 5.6295 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.6295 GeV/c².

So using that precise value, m c² is 5.6295 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714286.

So E = 3.5714286 *5.6295 ≈ ?

Compute 3 *5.6295 =16.8885.

0.5714286 *5.6295:

0.5 *5.6295 =2.81475.

0.0714286 *5.6295 ≈ 0.4038.

Total for 0.5714286 *5.6295 is 2.81475 +0.4038=3.21855.

Adding to 16.8885: 16.8885 +3.21855=20.10705 GeV.

So approximately 20.107 GeV.

But the option is 20.132 GeV. Hmm. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96²)) = 1/(sqrt(0.0784))=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000 = 196/2500. sqrt(196/2500) =14/50=0.28. So exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.017293 atomic mass units. So 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u =?

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.017293 *931.5 = let's compute 0.017293 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.000293 *931.5≈0.272.

So adding them: 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.272=16.1075.

So total is 5589 +16.1075 =5605.1075 MeV, which is 5.6051075 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.6051 GeV.

Wait, that's actually lower than my previous calculation. Oh, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.017293 *931.5 = let me compute this accurately.

0.017293 = 17293e-6.

17293e-6 *931.5 = Let's compute 17293 *931.5 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.017293 *931.5.

= 0.01 *931.5 =9.315
+ 0.007 *931.5=6.5205
+0.000293 *931.5≈0.272.

So as before, sum is 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.272=16.1075.

So 6.017293 *931.5 = (6 + 0.017293) *931.5 =6*931.5 +0.017293*931.5 =5589 +16.1075=5605.1075 MeV.

So 5.6051075 GeV.

So m c²=5.6051 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² =3.5714286 *5.6051 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.6051=16.8153

0.5714286 *5.6051.

Breaking it down:

0.5 *5.6051=2.80255

0.0714286 *5.6051≈0.4024.

Adding: 2.80255 +0.4024=3.20495.

So total is 16.8153 +3.20495=20.02025 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.02 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact mass of Li-6. Let me check another source. Maybe the mass is actually higher.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.017293 u. What is that in MeV/c²?

Each atomic mass unit is 931.494064 MeV/c².

So 6.017293 *931.494064 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494064 = 5588.964384.

0.017293 *931.494064.

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.007 *931.494064=6.52045845.

0.000293 *931.494064≈0.272.

So sum: 9.31494064 +6.52045845 =15.83539909 +0.272≈16.1074.

So total is 5588.964384 +16.1074 =5605.07178 MeV, which is 5.60507178 GeV.

So m c²=5.60507 GeV.

Then, gamma=25/7=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.60507 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60507.

Let me do this multiplication more accurately.

5.60507 *3.57142857.

Perhaps it's easier to do 5.60507 * (25/7).

5.60507 *25 =140.12675.

140.12675 /7=20.018107 GeV.

So approximately 20.018 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmmm, that's off by about 0.114 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect. Maybe I should consider the actual mass of a Li-6 atom, including electrons, and then subtract the electrons' mass?

Wait, no. Because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. So the rest mass of the nucleus is just the mass of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which includes electrons, and then subtract the electrons' mass to get the nucleus's mass.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So the mass of 3 electrons is 1.533 MeV.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6.017293 u - 3*(electron mass).

The electron mass is approximately 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons is 0.00164575 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.017293 -0.00164575 =6.01564725 u.

Wait, that's more accurate.

So m_nucleus =6.01564725 u.

Convert that to GeV/c²: 6.01564725 u *931.494064 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01564725 *931.494064=?

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.00564725 *931.494064≈5.2406.

So total 9.31494064 +5.2406≈14.5555.

So m_nucleus c²=5588.964384 +14.5555=5603.51988 MeV, which is 5.60351988 GeV.

So m c²=5.60352 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60352 GeV.

Compute that.

3 *5.60352 =16.81056.

0.57142857 *5.60352.

Compute 0.5 *5.60352=2.80176.

0.07142857 *5.60352≈0.4024.

So sum is 2.80176 +0.4024=3.20416.

Adding to 16.81056: 16.81056 +3.20416=20.01472 GeV.

Approximately 20.0147 GeV.

Still, the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So I'm getting about 20.01 GeV, but the option is 20.13. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps a more precise calculation of gamma might change the result. Wait, but 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, so 1 -0.9216 is 0.0784, and sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is intended to consider beta as 0.96, but calculate gamma with more precise beta.

Wait, perhaps beta isn't exactly 0.96 but given to certain decimal places. But the question states 0.96c, so beta is exactly 0.96.

Hmm. I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy between my calculation (20.01 GeV) and the option (20.132 GeV). Is there another factor I'm missing?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon instead of per nucleus. No, the question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, so I think the energy is per nucleus.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute gamma correctly. Let me compute gamma again step by step.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round the gamma to 3.57 instead of 3.5714.

Wait, if gamma is 3.57, then E =3.57 *5.60352 GeV.

3.57 *5.60352 = ?

3 *5.60352=16.81056.

0.57 *5.60352=3.19446.

So total 16.81056 +3.19446=20.00502 GeV. Still around 20.005 GeV.

Hmm. The only option close to that is C)20.132 and D)21.419. Wait, none of the other options are near 20.0 GeV except C.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check again.

Wait, another source: the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u.

So the rest mass energy is 6.017293 *931.494064 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.017293 *931.494064 ≈ 16.093 MeV.

So total is 5588.964384 +16.093 ≈5605.057 MeV ≈5.605057 GeV.

So if m c² is approximately 5.605057 GeV.

E =3.5714286 *5.605057 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.605057.

3 *5.605057=16.815171.

0.5714286 *5.605057.

Compute 0.5 *5.605057=2.8025285.

0.0714286 *5.605057≈0.4036.

So sum is 2.8025285 +0.4036 ≈3.2061285.

Adding to 16.815171 gives 20.0212995 GeV.

Approximately 20.0213 GeV.

So the exact value would be around 20.02 GeV, but the option is 20.132, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, beta =0.96. So beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely using a calculator, but I can't do that now. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation of the rest mass is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the deuteron or something else. No, deuteron is H-2 or He-2, not Li-6.

Wait, another thought: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually 6.017293 u, but when calculating, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass as 6.017293 *931.5 MeV, without any consideration for electrons.

So let me compute 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.017293 *931.5=16.1075 MeV.

So total is 5589 +16.1075=5605.1075 MeV=5.6051075 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6051075 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately:

3.57142857 *5.6051075.

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.6051075.

3*5.6051075=16.8153225.

0.5 *5.6051075=2.80255375.

0.07142857 *5.6051075.

Compute 0.07 *5.6051075=0.392357525.

0.00142857 *5.6051075≈0.00799999.

Adding 0.392357525 +0.00799999=0.4003575.

So summing all parts: 16.8153225 +2.80255375=19.61787625 +0.4003575=20.01823375 GeV.

Approximately 20.0182 GeV.

Still, the option is 20.132, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Wait, the problem states the speed is 0.96c. So it's indeed 0.96.

Wait, perhaps my calculation for gamma is incorrect because I'm using an approximate value for beta. But beta is exactly 0.96, so I think it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is wrong and the correct mass is higher. For example, maybe the mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u, which as we calculated gives about 5.605 GeV. But perhaps the exact value is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons, but that would complicate things further. But in that case, the nucleus's mass would be less.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, such as the energy in terms of velocity.

Wait, another thought: the total energy is given by E = gamma m c². Alternatively, gamma can be found using the relation:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But I've already used that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal places.

Wait, beta is 0.96. So beta=0.96.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value of 0.96 is 0.96000000, so maybe the calculation is done with more precise decimals, but I think that won't change much.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula. Let me think again.

Another formula for gamma is gamma = (total energy) / (rest energy).

Wait, but that's the definition. So I'm confident that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy in a different unit. No, the problem gives the options in GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each nucleus has multiple nucleons, but the energy is given per nucleon. But that would change the calculation.

Wait, no, because the question says "the speed of the nucleus X", so each nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and the energy is per nucleus.

I think I've done everything correctly. The calculation comes out to about 20.02 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact mass of Li-6 again. Let me look it up in my mind. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.017293 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Electron mass is 0.0005485799 u each. So 3 electrons = 0.0016457397 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.017293 -0.0016457397 =6.01564726 u.

Then, converting to MeV/c²: 6.01564726 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.01564726 *931.494064 = approx 14.56 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.964384 +14.56=5603.524384 MeV=5.603524 GeV.

E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603524 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.603524=16.810572.

0.57142857 *5.603524.

Compute 0.5 *5.603524=2.801762.

0.07142857 *5.603524≈0.402405.

So sum 2.801762 +0.402405=3.204167.

Adding to 16.810572 gives 20.014739 GeV.

Hmm, still about 20.0147 GeV.

At this point, I think the correct answer must be option C)20.132 GeV, given the choices, perhaps due to a slight variation in the rest mass value used in the problem.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as (number of nucleons) * (average mass of nucleon). But if the average is 938.272 MeV for protons and 939.565 for neutrons, then for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be 3*938.272 +3*939.565 = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m c²=5.6335 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6335=?

3 *5.6335=16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335.

0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.07142857 *5.6335≈0.4040.

Sum:2.81675+0.4040=3.22075.

Total E=16.9005 +3.22075=20.12125 GeV.

Ah, now this is 20.12125 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV. So perhaps the problem uses this approximation for the rest mass, not considering the exact atomic mass including electrons.

So the correct calculation using m c²=5.6335 GeV gives E=20.121 GeV, which rounds to approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). Thus, the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Nucleus X**: Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
2. **Rest Mass of Li-6**: The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximated as the sum of the masses of its nucleons. Using the average nucleon mass of 938 MeV/c², the total rest mass is:
   \[
   m c^2 = 6 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   For a more precise calculation, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 (6.017293 u) was converted to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), yielding:
   \[
   m c^2 \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy**: The total energy of the nucleus is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2,
   \]
   where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For \(v = 0.96c\), \(\beta = 0.96\), and:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
   \]

4. **Calculation of Total Energy**: Substituting \(\gamma \approx 3.5714\) and \(m c^2 \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV}\) into the energy formula:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.02 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Refinement and Comparison with Options:
- Using the more precise rest mass \(m c^2 \approx 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}\) (based on nucleon masses), the total energy becomes:
  \[
  E = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}.
  \]
- This value is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**, suggesting that the problem may use a slightly different approximation for the rest mass or rounding conventions.

### Conclusion:
The energy of the RHIC, ensuring the Li-6 nucleus travels at 0.96c, is approximately **20.132 GeV**, which matches option C.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Li typically has 3 protons, but with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? So Li-6 nuclei.

The options given are four different energies in GeV. I need to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this. I think it's a relativistic mechanics problem because we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, 0.96c is pretty fast.

So, the first thing I should figure out is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, how do I find that? I know that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated by taking the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But maybe there's a simpler way since the problem doesn't give any specific data on binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps they just want me to use the rest mass in terms of a known particle.

Wait, I think for such problems, the rest mass is often considered as the mass number times the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron). Because protons and neutrons have almost the same mass, around 938 MeV/c² each. So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 6 nucleons.

So, the rest mass m would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. I remember that the actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of the binding energy. However, since the problem doesn't provide any specific data, perhaps we're supposed to ignore that and just take the rest mass as 6 * (proton mass), which is a common approximation in such problems.

So, m = 6 * (938 MeV/c²) = 5.628 GeV/c².

Now, the kinetic energy plus the rest energy is the total energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, wait. I'm a bit confused about this point. Let me think. When they say the energy of the collider, do they refer to the kinetic energy per particle or the total energy?

Wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually mean the kinetic energy plus the rest energy, because the particles are moving at relativistic speeds. So the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma.

So, v = 0.96c. Let's compute beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/ sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, exact calculation: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c². Since m c² is 5.628 GeV, E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.628.

Hmm, 3.5 * 5.6 is 19.6. Let me compute more accurately:

3.5714 * 5.628 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.628.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857
3.5714 * 0.628 = ?

0.628 can be broken into 0.6, 0.02, and 0.008.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 * 0.02 = 0.071428
3.5714 * 0.008 = 0.0285712

Adding these together: 2.14284 + 0.071428 = 2.214268 + 0.0285712 = 2.2428392

So total is 17.857 + 2.2428392 = 20.0998392 GeV.

So approximately 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to my calculation.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Because Li-6 has a precise mass, perhaps I should find the exact mass instead of using 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV because of the binding energy. Let me think about that. The mass of a nucleus is given by the mass defect formula: M = Z*m_p + N*m_n - M_nucleus. But since m_p and m_n are almost the same (proton is about 938.272 MeV, neutron is about 939.565 MeV), the average is around 938.9 MeV.

But perhaps for this problem, they just expect us to use the mass number (A=6) times the proton mass as a rough estimate. But wait, the exact value might be necessary for the correct option.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. But since I don't have that data, perhaps the calculation is intended to be done with the approximation.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually (number of protons + neutrons) × (average mass of a nucleon) minus binding energy. But without exact data, this is tricky. So perhaps the problem expects us to simply take the rest mass as A × (mass of a proton), which in this case is 6 * 938 MeV/c², so 5.628 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which is a collider. So each beam has particles moving in opposite directions. So in this case, the total energy would be considering both beams? Or is each beam's energy the value we're calculating and the total would be double? No, wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps it's the energy per nucleus per beam.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC", which is likely the total energy imparted to each nucleus. So each nucleus has a certain energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), not the total energy (gamma mc² - mc²). Because sometimes, when people talk about the kinetic energy of particles in colliders, they refer to the kinetic part.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, the energy in the collider's context is usually the total energy. Because for relativistic particles, the kinetic energy is approximately equal to the total energy when v is near c. But wait, that's not exactly true. Let's think.

The total energy E is gamma mc², and the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) mc².

So for v=0.96c, gamma is about 3.5714, so K = (3.5714 -1) * 5.628 GeV = 2.5714 *5.628 ≈ 14.45 GeV.

But the options are all in the high teens to low twenties, so that's not matching. So that suggests that the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because 20 GeV is one of the options.

So back to the calculation: E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ 20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which matches.

Wait, but let me recompute gamma more accurately. Because I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28, which is exact, but let me confirm:

0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So, precisely, gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

Now, m c² is 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So the product is 3.5714286 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714286 * 5.628.

Breaking it down:

3 * 5.628 = 16.884
0.5714286 *5.628.

Wait, 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814. 0.0714286 *5.628 is approximately 0.40411... So 2.814 + 0.40411 ≈ 3.21811.

So total is 16.884 + 3.21811 ≈ 20.10211 GeV.

So approximately 20.102 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe because I used 938 MeV for each nucleon. But the actual mass of the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

Wait, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the exact rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Hmm, so the more precise rest mass is about 5.6335 GeV.

So let's recompute gamma * m c² with this more accurate m.

Gamma is 3.5714286.

So 3.5714286 * 5.633511 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.5714286 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511 = 2.8167555.

0.0714286 *5.633511 ≈ 0.40443.

So 2.8167555 + 0.40443 = 3.2211855.

Adding to 16.900533: 16.900533 + 3.2211855 = 20.1217185 GeV.

So approximately 20.1217 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but not exact. Why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the gamma calculation.

Wait, another way: let me compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857....

So gamma is exactly 35/10, wait no, 3.57142857 is 25/7, approximately.

Wait, 25/7 is 3.57142857... So yes.

So gamma is 25/7.

So m c² is 5.633511 GeV.

So E = (25/7) * 5.633511.

Compute 25 * 5.633511 = ?

5 *5.633511 is 28.167555.

Wait, 5.633511 * 25:

5 *25 =125, 0.633511 *25=15.837775.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 5.633511 *25 = (5 + 0.633511) *25 = 125 + (0.633511 *25) = 125 +15.837775 = 140.837775.

Then, divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 ≈ 20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the problem is considering the kinetic energy as the total energy provided by the collider. Let me see.

If E is the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) m c².

Earlier, with m c²=5.6335 GeV, gamma is 3.5714.

So E = (3.5714 -1) *5.6335 = 2.5714 *5.6335 ≈ 14.48 GeV. But the options are higher, so that's not it.

So the initial approach was correct, that it's the total energy (gamma * mc²). So the correct energy is approximately 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). So why is there a slight difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but the exact mass is known. The standard atomic weight includes electrons as well, but here we're talking about the nucleus, so we don't include electrons.

The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.017293 u (atomic mass units). One atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.017293 u is 6.017293 *931.5 ≈ 5629.5 MeV, which is 5.6295 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.6295 GeV/c².

So using that precise value, m c² is 5.6295 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714286.

So E = 3.5714286 *5.6295 ≈ ?

Compute 3 *5.6295 =16.8885.

0.5714286 *5.6295:

0.5 *5.6295 =2.81475.

0.0714286 *5.6295 ≈ 0.4038.

Total for 0.5714286 *5.6295 is 2.81475 +0.4038=3.21855.

Adding to 16.8885: 16.8885 +3.21855=20.10705 GeV.

So approximately 20.107 GeV.

But the option is 20.132 GeV. Hmm. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96²)) = 1/(sqrt(0.0784))=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000 = 196/2500. sqrt(196/2500) =14/50=0.28. So exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.017293 atomic mass units. So 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u =?

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.017293 *931.5 = let's compute 0.017293 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.000293 *931.5≈0.272.

So adding them: 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.272=16.1075.

So total is 5589 +16.1075 =5605.1075 MeV, which is 5.6051075 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.6051 GeV.

Wait, that's actually lower than my previous calculation. Oh, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.017293 *931.5 = let me compute this accurately.

0.017293 = 17293e-6.

17293e-6 *931.5 = Let's compute 17293 *931.5 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.017293 *931.5.

= 0.01 *931.5 =9.315
+ 0.007 *931.5=6.5205
+0.000293 *931.5≈0.272.

So as before, sum is 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.272=16.1075.

So 6.017293 *931.5 = (6 + 0.017293) *931.5 =6*931.5 +0.017293*931.5 =5589 +16.1075=5605.1075 MeV.

So 5.6051075 GeV.

So m c²=5.6051 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² =3.5714286 *5.6051 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.6051=16.8153

0.5714286 *5.6051.

Breaking it down:

0.5 *5.6051=2.80255

0.0714286 *5.6051≈0.4024.

Adding: 2.80255 +0.4024=3.20495.

So total is 16.8153 +3.20495=20.02025 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.02 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact mass of Li-6. Let me check another source. Maybe the mass is actually higher.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.017293 u. What is that in MeV/c²?

Each atomic mass unit is 931.494064 MeV/c².

So 6.017293 *931.494064 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494064 = 5588.964384.

0.017293 *931.494064.

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.007 *931.494064=6.52045845.

0.000293 *931.494064≈0.272.

So sum: 9.31494064 +6.52045845 =15.83539909 +0.272≈16.1074.

So total is 5588.964384 +16.1074 =5605.07178 MeV, which is 5.60507178 GeV.

So m c²=5.60507 GeV.

Then, gamma=25/7=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.60507 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60507.

Let me do this multiplication more accurately.

5.60507 *3.57142857.

Perhaps it's easier to do 5.60507 * (25/7).

5.60507 *25 =140.12675.

140.12675 /7=20.018107 GeV.

So approximately 20.018 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmmm, that's off by about 0.114 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect. Maybe I should consider the actual mass of a Li-6 atom, including electrons, and then subtract the electrons' mass?

Wait, no. Because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. So the rest mass of the nucleus is just the mass of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which includes electrons, and then subtract the electrons' mass to get the nucleus's mass.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So the mass of 3 electrons is 1.533 MeV.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6.017293 u - 3*(electron mass).

The electron mass is approximately 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons is 0.00164575 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.017293 -0.00164575 =6.01564725 u.

Wait, that's more accurate.

So m_nucleus =6.01564725 u.

Convert that to GeV/c²: 6.01564725 u *931.494064 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01564725 *931.494064=?

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.00564725 *931.494064≈5.2406.

So total 9.31494064 +5.2406≈14.5555.

So m_nucleus c²=5588.964384 +14.5555=5603.51988 MeV, which is 5.60351988 GeV.

So m c²=5.60352 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60352 GeV.

Compute that.

3 *5.60352 =16.81056.

0.57142857 *5.60352.

Compute 0.5 *5.60352=2.80176.

0.07142857 *5.60352≈0.4024.

So sum is 2.80176 +0.4024=3.20416.

Adding to 16.81056: 16.81056 +3.20416=20.01472 GeV.

Approximately 20.0147 GeV.

Still, the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So I'm getting about 20.01 GeV, but the option is 20.13. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps a more precise calculation of gamma might change the result. Wait, but 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, so 1 -0.9216 is 0.0784, and sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is intended to consider beta as 0.96, but calculate gamma with more precise beta.

Wait, perhaps beta isn't exactly 0.96 but given to certain decimal places. But the question states 0.96c, so beta is exactly 0.96.

Hmm. I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy between my calculation (20.01 GeV) and the option (20.132 GeV). Is there another factor I'm missing?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon instead of per nucleus. No, the question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, so I think the energy is per nucleus.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute gamma correctly. Let me compute gamma again step by step.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round the gamma to 3.57 instead of 3.5714.

Wait, if gamma is 3.57, then E =3.57 *5.60352 GeV.

3.57 *5.60352 = ?

3 *5.60352=16.81056.

0.57 *5.60352=3.19446.

So total 16.81056 +3.19446=20.00502 GeV. Still around 20.005 GeV.

Hmm. The only option close to that is C)20.132 and D)21.419. Wait, none of the other options are near 20.0 GeV except C.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check again.

Wait, another source: the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u.

So the rest mass energy is 6.017293 *931.494064 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.017293 *931.494064 ≈ 16.093 MeV.

So total is 5588.964384 +16.093 ≈5605.057 MeV ≈5.605057 GeV.

So if m c² is approximately 5.605057 GeV.

E =3.5714286 *5.605057 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.605057.

3 *5.605057=16.815171.

0.5714286 *5.605057.

Compute 0.5 *5.605057=2.8025285.

0.0714286 *5.605057≈0.4036.

So sum is 2.8025285 +0.4036 ≈3.2061285.

Adding to 16.815171 gives 20.0212995 GeV.

Approximately 20.0213 GeV.

So the exact value would be around 20.02 GeV, but the option is 20.132, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, beta =0.96. So beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely using a calculator, but I can't do that now. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation of the rest mass is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the deuteron or something else. No, deuteron is H-2 or He-2, not Li-6.

Wait, another thought: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually 6.017293 u, but when calculating, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass as 6.017293 *931.5 MeV, without any consideration for electrons.

So let me compute 6.017293 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.017293 *931.5=16.1075 MeV.

So total is 5589 +16.1075=5605.1075 MeV=5.6051075 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6051075 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately:

3.57142857 *5.6051075.

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.6051075.

3*5.6051075=16.8153225.

0.5 *5.6051075=2.80255375.

0.07142857 *5.6051075.

Compute 0.07 *5.6051075=0.392357525.

0.00142857 *5.6051075≈0.00799999.

Adding 0.392357525 +0.00799999=0.4003575.

So summing all parts: 16.8153225 +2.80255375=19.61787625 +0.4003575=20.01823375 GeV.

Approximately 20.0182 GeV.

Still, the option is 20.132, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Wait, the problem states the speed is 0.96c. So it's indeed 0.96.

Wait, perhaps my calculation for gamma is incorrect because I'm using an approximate value for beta. But beta is exactly 0.96, so I think it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is wrong and the correct mass is higher. For example, maybe the mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u, which as we calculated gives about 5.605 GeV. But perhaps the exact value is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons, but that would complicate things further. But in that case, the nucleus's mass would be less.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, such as the energy in terms of velocity.

Wait, another thought: the total energy is given by E = gamma m c². Alternatively, gamma can be found using the relation:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But I've already used that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal places.

Wait, beta is 0.96. So beta=0.96.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value of 0.96 is 0.96000000, so maybe the calculation is done with more precise decimals, but I think that won't change much.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula. Let me think again.

Another formula for gamma is gamma = (total energy) / (rest energy).

Wait, but that's the definition. So I'm confident that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy in a different unit. No, the problem gives the options in GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each nucleus has multiple nucleons, but the energy is given per nucleon. But that would change the calculation.

Wait, no, because the question says "the speed of the nucleus X", so each nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and the energy is per nucleus.

I think I've done everything correctly. The calculation comes out to about 20.02 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact mass of Li-6 again. Let me look it up in my mind. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.017293 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.017293 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Electron mass is 0.0005485799 u each. So 3 electrons = 0.0016457397 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.017293 -0.0016457397 =6.01564726 u.

Then, converting to MeV/c²: 6.01564726 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.01564726 *931.494064 = approx 14.56 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.964384 +14.56=5603.524384 MeV=5.603524 GeV.

E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603524 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.603524=16.810572.

0.57142857 *5.603524.

Compute 0.5 *5.603524=2.801762.

0.07142857 *5.603524≈0.402405.

So sum 2.801762 +0.402405=3.204167.

Adding to 16.810572 gives 20.014739 GeV.

Hmm, still about 20.0147 GeV.

At this point, I think the correct answer must be option C)20.132 GeV, given the choices, perhaps due to a slight variation in the rest mass value used in the problem.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as (number of nucleons) * (average mass of nucleon). But if the average is 938.272 MeV for protons and 939.565 for neutrons, then for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be 3*938.272 +3*939.565 = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m c²=5.6335 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6335=?

3 *5.6335=16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335.

0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.07142857 *5.6335≈0.4040.

Sum:2.81675+0.4040=3.22075.

Total E=16.9005 +3.22075=20.12125 GeV.

Ah, now this is 20.12125 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV. So perhaps the problem uses this approximation for the rest mass, not considering the exact atomic mass including electrons.

So the correct calculation using m c²=5.6335 GeV gives E=20.121 GeV, which rounds to approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). Thus, the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Nucleus X**: Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
2. **Rest Mass of Li-6**: The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximated as the sum of the masses of its nucleons. Using the average nucleon mass of 938 MeV/c², the total rest mass is:
   \[
   m c^2 = 6 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   For a more precise calculation, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 (6.017293 u) was converted to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), yielding:
   \[
   m c^2 \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy**: The total energy of the nucleus is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2,
   \]
   where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For \(v = 0.96c\), \(\beta = 0.96\), and:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
   \]

4. **Calculation of Total Energy**: Substituting \(\gamma \approx 3.5714\) and \(m c^2 \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV}\) into the energy formula:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.02 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Refinement and Comparison with Options:
- Using the more precise rest mass \(m c^2 \approx 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}\) (based on nucleon masses), the total energy becomes:
  \[
  E = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}.
  \]
- This value is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**, suggesting that the problem may use a slightly different approximation for the rest mass or rounding conventions.

### Conclusion:
The energy of the RHIC, ensuring the Li-6 nucleus travels at 0.96c, is approximately **20.132 GeV**, which matches option C.

**Answer: C**
