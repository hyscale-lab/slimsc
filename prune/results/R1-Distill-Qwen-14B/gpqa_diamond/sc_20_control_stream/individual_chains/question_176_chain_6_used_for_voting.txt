Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three-dimensional space. The operators for two observables, P and Q, are given as square matrices. I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P.

Hmm, okay. Observables correspond to Hermitian operators, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which makes sense for measurable quantities.

First, let me write down the matrices for P and Q.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

But the question is about measuring Q after P. So I think the order is important here. I remember that when you measure an observable, the state collapses into one of the eigenvectors of that observable. So measuring P first would collapse the system into an eigenstate of P. Then measuring Q would be done on this new state.

So the process is: measure P, get 0, then measure Q on the resulting state and get -1.

Wait, but I need to find the probability of both events happening in sequence: first P=0, then Q=-1. So the total probability is the probability of getting P=0 multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P=0.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the combined probability considering the measurement order.

Let me think. The system is initially in state |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1]. To find the probability of P being 0 and then Q being -1, I need to first find the eigenstates of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, after the state collapses into that eigenstate, find the probability of Q being -1.

Wait, but P's eigenstates may not be the same as Q's. So the idea is:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

2. For the initial state, project onto the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

That will give a new state, which is the post-measurement state after P=0.

3. Then, find the probability that measuring Q on this new state yields -1.

So let's start with P.

The matrix P is given as:

[ 0        1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2      0    ]

Wait, this looks like a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian. Let me compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Hmm, solving for eigenvalues might be a bit tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues. The matrix is 3x3, so the characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ        1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2     -λ        1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2     -λ    ]

Calculating the determinant:

Let me expand along the first row.

-λ * det([[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]]) - (1/√2) * det([[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]]) + 0 * ... 

So first term: 

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 

Second term: 

- (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ] ) 

= -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 

= -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ] 

= (λ)/(2) 

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0 

Let me factor this:

= -λ³ + (λ)(1/2) + λ/2 

= -λ³ + λ 

= λ ( -λ² + 1 )

Set equal to zero:

λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 

So λ can be 0, or λ^2 = 1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1.

So for P=0, the eigenvectors are the vectors corresponding to λ=0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We have (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → again v2=0.

So from the first and third equations, v2=0.

From the second equation, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1; 0; v3] where v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1; 0; -1].

Wait, because if v1 = 1 and v3 = -1, that gives [1, 0, -1]. Alternatively, scaling, any multiple of this vector.

So the eigenvectors for P=0 are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Let me write this as a vector, say, |0⟩.

Now, any state in this eigenspace can be written as a scalar multiple of |0⟩.

Wait, but what if there's more than one eigenvector for λ=0? Because sometimes, for a given eigenvalue, the eigenspace can be multi-dimensional. But looking at the system of equations, it seems that the only solution is multiples of (1,0,-1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

So the eigenvectors for P=0 are all scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Let me check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the matrix P has another eigenvector for λ=0. Let me see.

Wait, the matrix P is:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So when λ=0, the system P|v⟩ = 0.

So equations:

1) (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0
2) (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → v1 = -v3
3) (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

So v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3. So the solution is any vector where v2=0, v1= -v3. So the eigenvectors are of the form [a, 0, -a], which can be written as a*(1,0,-1). So yes, the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

So the projection of the initial state onto the eigenspace of P=0 is the probability amplitude for P=0.

The initial state is |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |0⟩ = (1, 0, -1)^T (up to normalization).

Wait, but I should normalize |0⟩. Let me compute the norm: sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the projection of |ψ⟩ onto |0⟩ is:

⟨0| ψ⟩ = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] · [-1, 2, 1]

= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))(1)

= (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) 

= -2/(sqrt(2)) 

= -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, the projection should be a scalar, but the probability is the square of the absolute value.

Wait, but wait—this can’t be right because the probability can’t be more than 1. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, the initial state |ψ⟩ is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. But I should probably normalize it first.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to normalize the initial state. Let me check the norm of |ψ⟩.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So |ψ⟩ is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but the problem statement says the state is given by that column matrix. So perhaps I should normalize it first before proceeding.

So the normalized state is |ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So when I compute the inner product with |0⟩, I need to use the normalized |0⟩ and |ψ⟩.

So |0⟩ is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

|ψ⟩ is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1 * 1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So total inner product is (-1/(2*sqrt(3))) + 0 + (-1/(2*sqrt(3))) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, so that's the first part. Now, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the state |0⟩, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, we measure Q on this new state.

Q's matrix is diagonal: [1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0,-1].

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. Because Q is diagonal, each basis vector is an eigenvector.

So the eigenvectors are |1⟩ = (1,0,0), |0⟩_Q = (0,1,0), and |-1⟩ = (0,0,1).

Wait, but when we have the state after P=0 being |0⟩ (which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) ), what is the probability that measuring Q gives -1?

Well, the state is |0⟩ = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is | -1 ⟩ = (0, 0, 1).

So the inner product is ⟨ -1 | 0 ⟩ = (0,0,1) · (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. Since the state |0⟩ after P=0 is an eigenstate of Q? Or is it?

Wait, no. |0⟩ is an eigenstate of P, but not necessarily of Q. So when we measure Q on |0⟩, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1, 0, and -1.

The probability for each outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state |0⟩.

So the state |0⟩ is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Expressed in terms of Q's eigenstates, that's:

(1/sqrt(2)) |1⟩ + 0 |0⟩_Q + (-1/sqrt(2)) |-1⟩.

So the amplitudes are:

- For Q=1: 1/sqrt(2)
- For Q=0: 0
- For Q=-1: -1/sqrt(2)

So the probabilities are:

P(Q=1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
P(Q=0) = 0
P(Q=-1) = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2

Wait, that's odd. So the state |0⟩ is an equal superposition of |1⟩ and |-1⟩ in the Q basis.

So when measuring Q, we have a 50% chance of getting 1 and 50% for -1, and 0% for 0.

So the probability we're looking for is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 (which is 1/2) given that P was 0.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when we measure P first, the state collapses into |0⟩, which is an eigenstate of P, but Q is measured on that state. So the probabilities are as I just calculated.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait, the question states that we measure Q just after the measurement of P. So the total probability is the probability of first P=0, then Q=-1.

So that's (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

First, the initial state was [-1,2,1]^T. I normalized it to 1/sqrt(6) times that vector.

The eigenvector for P=0 is (1,0,-1)^T, normalized to 1/sqrt(2).

The inner product of the initial state with this vector gives the amplitude for P=0 measurement, which is (-1/sqrt(6))*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) → (-1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) + (-1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) → (-2)/(sqrt(12)) → sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2*sqrt(3))= -1/sqrt(3). The square is 1/3.

Upon measuring P=0, the state collapses to |0⟩, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Measuring Q on this state: the amplitude for Q=-1 is the inner product with | -1 ⟩, which is (0,0,1) . (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(2). The probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements and the associated probabilities. The system's initial state is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The norm of the initial state is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors satisfy \( P|\psi\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system, the eigenvectors are proportional to:

\[
|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing \( |0\rangle \), we get:

\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |0\rangle \). The projection is:

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Post-measurement state after \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses into the eigenstate \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |0\rangle_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The state \( |0\rangle \) after \( P = 0 \) can be expressed in terms of \( Q \)'s eigenstates:

\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |1\rangle + 0 |0\rangle_Q + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} |-1\rangle.
\]

The amplitude for \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
\langle -1 | 0 \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(Q=-1) = |\langle -1 | 0 \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]
