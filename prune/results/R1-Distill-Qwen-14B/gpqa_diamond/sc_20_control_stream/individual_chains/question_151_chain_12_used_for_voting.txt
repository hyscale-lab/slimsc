Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable, P, and getting the value 0. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a matrix with specific elements. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes.

Wait, right. So the first thing I need to do is probably find the eigenvalues of matrix P because those are the possible results you can measure. The probability of getting a certain eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's projection onto the system's state.

But wait, the problem is that I don't know the eigenvalues of P yet. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that down.

So P looks like:
[ 0   1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2 0   1/√2]
[0   1/√2 0 ]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, finding eigenvalues might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P can be diagonalized, and its eigenvalues are the possible outcomes. Let me think about the structure of P. Oh, wait, maybe it's a projection matrix or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tensor product or some symmetric structure.

Wait, wait, let me compute the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation for a matrix M is det(M - λ I) = 0. So for matrix P, I'll set up the equation (P - λ I) and compute its determinant.

The matrix P - λ I would be:
[ -λ   1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2 -λ    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2 -λ ]

So the determinant is:

| -λ   1/√2    0 |
|1/√2  -λ   1/√2|
| 0    1/√2  -λ |

To compute this determinant, I'll expand along the first row.

The determinant is:
-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) 
- (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
+ 0 * det( ... ) (which is zero, so I can ignore that term)

So let's compute each part.

First term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
= -(1/√2) * ( -λ / √2 )
= -(1/√2) * (-λ / √2 )
= (λ) / 2

So the determinant is:
-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0.

Let me expand this:
-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, because -λ*(λ² - 1/2) is -λ^3 + (λ/2), and then adding λ/2 gives -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Which can be factored as λ (-λ² + 1) = 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, and -λ² +1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, but wait, we're looking for the eigenvalues of P. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1?

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if I compute the determinant correctly, perhaps I made a mistake in signs.

Wait, let me recheck the determinant calculation.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 

Which is -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Then the second term is - (1/√2) multiplied by the minor, which is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and second column. So that submatrix is:

[1/√2  1/√2]
[0     -λ ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) → (-λ)/(√2).

So the second term is -(1/√2) * (-λ / √2 ) → (λ)/(2).

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) 

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2)
= -λ³ + λ.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(λ² -1 )= 0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

But wait, the problem is about measuring P and getting 0. So the eigenvalue 0 is one of the possible outcomes. So the probability we're looking for is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector corresponding to the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.

So the next step is to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, particularly for λ=0.

Let's find the eigenvector for λ=0. That would satisfy (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So let's write down the equations for (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

P is:
[0   1/√2  0 ]
[1/√2 0  1/√2 ]
[0   1/√2 0 ]

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3=0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, v3 ) with v1 = -v3.

Let me choose v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1).

Wait, let me check: If I plug into equation 2, (1/√2)( -a + a ) = 0. Yep, that's correct.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is proportional to (-1, 0, 1). Alternatively, (1,0,-1), but the direction is arbitrary.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me plug in v = [-1, 0, 1] into P and see if P v = 0.

Compute P*v:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 → (-1/√2) + (1/√2) )= 0.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(0) + 0*(1) )= 0.

So yes, P * v = [0, 0, 0], so this is an eigenvector for λ=0.

So the normalized eigenvector would be (-1, 0, 1) divided by its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)(-1, 0, 1).

Wait, no, wait. The vector is [-1, 0, 1], so when normalized, it's (1/√(2)) * [-1, 0, 1].

So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ).

Now, the system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me write this as |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v> corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So compute <v|ψ> and take its absolute value squared.

The eigenvector is |v> = [ -1/√2; 0; 1/√2 ].

So the inner product is:

( (-1/√2) )*(-1) + (0)*2 + (1/√2)*(1) )

= (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) 

= (1 + 1)/√2 

= 2/√2 = √2.

Wait, that can't be right because the inner product's magnitude should be at most 1 if the vectors are normalized. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. The state vector |ψ> is [-1, 2, 1]. But is it normalized? Let me check.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So |ψ> is not normalized. So when I compute the inner product, I should consider that.

Wait, but when you compute the probability, you take the inner product, square its magnitude, and that's the probability, regardless of normalization. But wait, no, the state vector should be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically assumed to be normalized (i.e., unit vectors).

Wait, but in this problem, the state is given as (-1,2,1). Let's compute its norm: sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6) ≈2.45. So the state vector isn't normalized. That's a bit strange, but perhaps the question is correct as is. Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize |ψ> before proceeding.

Hmm, wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it just says the state is given by that column matrix. So perhaps we should assume it's not normalized, and just proceed with the given vector.

But in any case, the inner product is:

< v | ψ > = [ -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] · [ -1, 2, 1 ] 

= (-1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 

= (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) 

= 2/√2 = √2.

Wait, but if the state isn't normalized, then the inner product could be larger than 1, but probabilities are calculated based on the projection, so perhaps I should normalize the state vector first.

Wait, perhaps I should normalize |ψ> to make it a unit vector. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not sum to 1.

Let's compute the norm of |ψ>:

||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6).

So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]. Let me denote this as |ψ_normalized> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

Then, the inner product with the eigenvector |v> is:

[ (-1/√2) ( -1 ) + (0)*2 + (1/√2)(1) ] / sqrt(6).

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate: |v> is [ -1/√2; 0; 1/√2 ].

The inner product is [ -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] · [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Which is (-1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)(1) = (1/√2) + (1/√2) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2).

Wait, but that's without normalizing |ψ>. If I don't normalize |ψ>, then the inner product is sqrt(2), and the probability would be (sqrt(2))² = 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should normalize the state vector first.

So |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]

The inner product with |v> is:

[ (-1/√2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1/√2)(1) ] * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Wait, no, the inner product is (v†) ψ, where ψ is not normalized. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product of |v> with the given state vector ψ, then square it.

Wait, no, let me make this clear: the probability is | <v | ψ> |².

But if |ψ> isn't normalized, then this might not be the correct probability. Because the probabilities should sum to 1 for all possible outcomes. So it's safer to assume that |ψ> is a normalized state vector. Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but in reality, it's not, so perhaps there's a typo or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation.

Wait, no, the eigenvector for λ=0 is correct because when I multiplied P by [ -1, 0, 1 ], it gave zero.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the eigenvectors for other eigenvalues as well, but the problem is only about the probability of getting 0, so perhaps I just need to compute that specific inner product.

Hold on, perhaps I should proceed without worrying about normalization for now and see where it gets me.

So the inner product is <v | ψ> = [ -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] · [ -1, 2, 1 ] = (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) ) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))² = 2. But that's impossible because probabilities can't be more than 1. So that must indicate that I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the state vector is meant to be normalized. Let me check the given state vector again: (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is 1 +4 +1=6. So the normalized vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

So I should compute the inner product between |v> and the normalized |ψ>.

So |v> is ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ), as before.

The inner product <v | ψ_normalized> is:

( (-1/√2) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0)*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + (1/√2)*(1/sqrt(6)) )

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) + 0 + (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) )

= 2/(sqrt(12))

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After computation, the eigenvalues are:
\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector
The system's state at time \( t \) is given as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The norm of \( |\psi\rangle \) is:
\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
The normalized state vector is:
\[
|\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Inner Product
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \):
\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Computing the inner product:
\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{6}} \left[ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability
The probability is:
\[
P(0) = |\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
